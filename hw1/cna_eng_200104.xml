    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN OIL FIRMS MAY BE ALLOWED ENTRY INTO TAIWAN MARKET THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign oil firms are eyeing the much
anticipated opening of Taiwan's petroleum market, which is expected
to happen as early as this September as long as related legislation
proceeds smoothly.</P>
      <P>Exxon-Mobil, one of the largest oil conglomerates in the world,
has mapped out plans to establish 10 service stations in northern and
central Taiwan initially, in the belief that the market will be
opened before long.</P>
      <P>Exxon's plan to edge into the local market, which will
undoubtedly be followed by similar moves by other international oil
firms, poses a threat to the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
and the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG), the only private oil processor
and operator in Taiwan now.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chao-yi, secretary-general of the Energy
Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the legislation of
the petroleum management law is expected to be passed during the
current Legislative Yuan session, which ends in May.</P>
      <P>After 21 rounds of debates and discussions between the
administration and the legislature and among the ruling and
opposition parties since 1999, Taiwan's legislators seem poised to
close the matter during this legislative session. This will make the
passage of the petroleum management law possible this summer, paving
the way for the entrance of foreign oil conglomerates into the Taiwan
market three months after the legislation is passed.</P>
      <P>If everything goes smoothly, the foreign oil firms are expected
to be allowed to enter the market on Sept. 1 at the earliest, which
would symbolize the formal liberalization of Taiwan's oil market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the expected passage of the petroleum management law
will also mandate the formal establishment of the Cabinet-level
Bureau of Energy and the privatization of CPC itself, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP LEGISLATORS VISIT BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of opposition People First Party
(PFP) legislators, including former Legislative Yuan President Liu
Sung-fan, left Taipei Sunday for a six-day visit to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The six-member delegation is scheduled to call on Chen Yunlin,
director of the mainland Chinese State Council's Taiwan Affairs
Office, and officials of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>PFP legislator Chen Chen-sheng said that the visit is aimed at
reducing cross-strait hostility so that the two sides can reduce the
threat of military confrontation, curtail an arms race and avoid an
unnecessary waste of resources.</P>
      <P>He added that the lawmakers also hope to urge the mainland
government to provide an essential degree of protection for Taiwan
businessmen working in the mainland.</P>
      <P>A total of 16 PFP legislators were originally slated to be a part
of the delegation. However, most stayed behind after their colleague
PFP legislator Diane Lee was hospitalized Wednesday after a scuffle
with independent legislator Lo Fu-chu, who punched her in the face.</P>
      <P>Liu said that a number of PFP legislators had to remain in Taiwan
to ensure that the incident would not be dismissed offhandedly.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers are also scheduled to visit Tianjin and Xian.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP HOLDS PRIMARY FOR NOMINATION REFERENCE FOR YEAREND'S ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 1 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) held
an inner-party primary election Sunday for a reference to determine
the nominations of party candidates for the yearend legislative,
local mayoral and magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>The yearend legislative and local elections, the first since the
DPP took over the presidency in May 2000, are crucial to the DPP's
political strength in the legislature and the layout of the party's
power in cities and counties under the Taiwan Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>Presently, the opposition Kuomintang still holds a majority in
the legislature.</P>
      <P>One hundred and forty-five DPP members have registered to compete
in the primary for the yearend constituency legislative election, 31
plan to strive for nomination to run in the election for at-large
legislators, and six have registered to run for overseas Chinese
legislative seats, sources at DPP headquarters said.</P>
      <P>The nominations of DPP candidates to run for at-large and
overseas Chinese legislative seats will depend on the number of votes
cast by party members.</P>
      <P>As for the local mayoral and magistrate elections, almost all the
nominees for the elections have been determined after coordination by
the DPP headquarters, the sources said, adding that only Kaohsiung
County and Taoyuan County must proceed with the second stage of
voting by party members.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP's regulations, party member voting, part of
the primary election process, accounts for 30 percent of the primary,
while a public opinion poll conducted earlier in the year accounts
for 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The results of the poll on DPP nominees for constituency
legislative seats will be unveiled after the voting ends Sunday
afternoon.</P>
      <P>Voting time is from 9 a.m. through 4 p.m. The DPP headquarters
estimated that the voting rate will exceed 70 percent.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reportedly
will not vote in the primary elections in order to maintain executive
neutrality.</P>

      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Frank Hsieh said Sunday that the party has looked into
reported cases of the use of forged or duplicate party membership
cards in the party's primaries conducted the same day, and that there
are "no problems."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said while casting his vote in the party primaries for the
year-end legislative, mayoral and county chief elections that people
are naturally nervous when such a large-scale primary is held for the
first time.</P>
      <P>The DPP boasts approximately 31,000 members in Kaohsiung,
Taiwan's second-largest city, and about 190,000 members islandwide.
Hsieh serves concurrently as Kaohsiung mayor.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in Taipei, where approximately 20,000 DPP members are
eligible to vote in the primaries, DPP Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen
said that a special task force will continue to investigate reported
cases of vote buying even after the results of the primaries are
announced later in the evening.</P>
      <P>Wu speculated that most cases of duplicate party membership cards
are due to members who have reapplied for membership or for

    <HEADLINE>ASIA'S LARGEST BICYCLE SHOW KICKS OFF IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives from the world's leading
bicycle producing countries vowed Sunday in Taipei to bolster global
environmental protection while seeking business prosperity for
themselves.</P>
      <P>More than 200 bicycle industry leaders from Canada, Italy, Japan,
the United States and Taiwan got together at the Taipei International
Convention Center Sunday for the Global Bicycle Summit to discuss
issues concerning bicycle development trends, marketing strategies,
the various regulations of different countries, and the growing
global popularity of electric bikes.</P>
      <P>In a joint statement, the bicycle leaders vowed to promote the
use and production of environmentally-friendly electric bikes and to
protect the globe from industrial pollution, especially that of
transportation vehicles.</P>
      <P>Expressing support for Taiwan bicycle industry's determination to
promote electric bikes, Lin Tah-hsiung, the Republic of China's
deputy environmental protection administrator, announced during the
summit that for Taiwanese users of electric bikes, the Environmental
Protection Administration will subsidize NT$3,000 (US$92) for each
unit purchase so as to prop up islandwide sales of the relatively new
product.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou concretely supported the use of
electric bikes by riding one personally at the event.</P>
      <P>Describing himself a permanent bike lover who rode bicycles to
school from his high school years in Taiwan to his graduate school
years in the United States, Ma said that Taipei City Hall is studying
a bicycle policy that would allow Taipei residents to ride around
town on exclusive bike paths, a challenging project in the crowded
and complicated city.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the 2001 Taipei International Bicycle Exhibition
kicked off at the Taipei World Trade Center Saturday with a total of
629 bicycle manufacturers and exporters from home and abroad
participating.</P>
      <P>The number of exhibitors surged to 629 this year, including 120
foreign firms, while that of display booths reached 1,739. The 2001
Taipei International Bicycle Exhibition is now the largest in Asia
and the second biggest worldwide, according to a spokesman for the
China External Trade Development Council, which sponsors the show.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exhibitors in the show kicked off a "Three-New Policy"
movement to make Taiwan, already a leading bicycle producing country
in the world, a center for the global bike industry. The "Three New
Policy" -- new materials, new functions and new usage -- is aimed at
further upgrading the quality of Taiwan-made bicycles and making the
products more competitive in world markets, they said.</P>
      <P>During the exhibition, a locally-developed hydrogen-fueled "clear
bike," the first kind of it worldwide, made its debut.</P>
      <P>The hydrogen-powered bike's maker said that it consumes only 30
grams of hydrogen every 60 kilometers. Its battery weighs less than
10 kilograms, about one-third of that of lead-acid batteries and
about half of that of nickel-hydrogen batteries, according to the
maker.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE'S MAINLAND CHINA DREAM (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If you love someone, send him or her to
mainland China, a "school" that fosters fast growth and maturity.
Likewise, if you hate somebody, let him or her go to the mainland, a
"hell" that can "break" a person in the blink of an eye.</P>
      <P>"Dreaming of success" is the common feature of Taiwanese who go
to mainland China to invest, work or study. Over there, working hard
is no guarantee of success, but it's an undisputed fact that anyone
who wants to succeed must work hard.</P>
      <P>Twenty years after mainland China launched its "open-door"
economic reforms, the number of Taiwan citizens who travel to the
mainland for family reunions, investment or study continues to set
new records.</P>
      <P>Official tallies compiled by both sides of the Taiwan Strait show
that Taiwanese made at least 3 million visits to the mainland in 2000
alone.</P>
      <P>Visiting the mainland is no longer a craze confined to elderly
retired soldiers who moved to Taiwan from the mainland at the end of
the Chinese civil war in the late 1940s. It has instead gradually
become a phenomenon of everyday life in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>And in the face of the enthusiastic mainland-bound migration
mania, many relevant issues are worthy of study -- what those people
dream of doing on the mainland, how many of them succeed, how many of
them see their dreams shattered, and how their lives are there.</P>
      <P>Taiwan people who jump on the mainland bandwagon do so for
various reasons. While some people aspire to find a new lease on life
for their traditional businesses or to launch new ventures, many
youths want to study there, and others are simply seeking reunion
with their family members there.</P>
      <P>But generally speaking, Taiwan migrants to the mainland can be
divided into four groups -- owners of Taiwan-financed companies,
management staff of those companies, students and family members of
the aforesaid three kinds of people.</P>
      <P>Among the "owners" group is a 29-year-old man who asked to be
identified only by his family name, Soong. The scion of a family that
has run a traditional manufacturing business in central Taiwan for
years, Soong moved to Shanghai three years ago to manage a production
facility there. His eyes lack the shafts of passion so common in
people of his age. What he shows is precocious sophistication.</P>
      <P>Soong said investing in mainland China is something that was
"forced" upon him. "Under the wave of the economic globalization,
Taiwan's traditional businesses have no alternative but to relocate
to mainland China, which boasts cheaper labor and land," he
explained.</P>
      <P>As the eldest son of a business family, Soong said he is not free
to choose what he does with his life and career. "Life is lonely in
Shanghai. Work is the only thing in my everyday life," he complained.</P>
      <P>Much to Soong's disappointment and frustration, his Shanghai
factory is still operating in the red. "I sometimes think of
withdrawing my investment from the mainland and returning to Taiwan.
But the idea usually recedes quickly. I'm unwilling to give up now
after devoting so much energy, time and capital to my business here."</P>
      <P>Soong said even though he understands that very few Taiwan
enterprises have managed to establish themselves in the vast mainland
market over the past two decades, he still wants to continue to
strive for a breakthrough there.

      <P>"Migrating to the mainland for work is a road of no return," says
Mr. Chen, who manages an electronics factory in Dongguan, Guangdong
province, invested by a publicly listed Taiwan company.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that his company sent him to the mainland five
years ago to set up a production facility in Dongguan to save
operational costs.</P>
      <P>"I accepted the assignment with a view to increasing my
professional experience. But I didn't think at that time that I would
stay long on the mainland," he said.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, Chen said, "return to Taiwan" is no longer his
favorite choice. "For one thing, our Taiwan headquarters has no
suitable position for me. On the other hand, I'm afraid that I can
no longer adapt myself to the life of a salaryman in Taiwan," he
added.</P>
      <P>Asked if he were allowed to make a choice again, would he still
opt for working on the mainland? Chen, who was divorced last
year, paused a while and then said: "There is no 'if' in real
life."</P>
      <P>In contrast to Taiwan businesspeople's complicated feelings about
their movement to the mainland, their family members and young Taiwan
migrant students seem to have more romantic dreams of their lives of
future on the mainland.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan student at a Shanghai medical college, identified
himself as "Little Lee," said he chose to travel to Shanghai for
study mainly because he could realize his dream to study
medicine without the need to take part in highly competitive
entrance examinations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said, four years of life in Shanghai have
changed many of his concepts and ideals. In fact, he no longer
spends much time in school and instead devotes much of his energy to
running an advertising agency.</P>
      <P>Lee said he has no plan to return to Taiwan at least in the
foreseeable future. "Since Taiwan does not recognize the mainland
academic accreditation, I plans to stay in Shanghai to operate my
advertising business," he said, adding he is convinced that he stands
a good chance of success with the extensive human connections he has
developed during his four-year schooling in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>And for Mrs. Tu, her migration to the mainland is mainly for
"living together with her husband." Mrs. Tu, who already made
three visits to her husband's workplace in Dongguan, said the living
environment in the Dongguan area is not good. "There is almost no
fun, no amusement facilities there," she said. "Nevertheless,
nothing is more important than family reunion. I have decided to
move there to live together with my husband and I believe that
tomorrow will be better."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTRY TO ADD CRIMINAL STATUTES TO ANTI-CD PIRACY LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 1 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Chen Ruey-long said
Sunday that his ministry will gather related government agency
officials to discuss the incorporation of criminal statutes into an
anti-CD piracy draft law in the next few days.</P>
      <P>Demonstrating Taiwan's determination to protect intellectual
property rights, Chen said that the Economics Ministry will specify
criminal responsibility for copyright infringements in an optical
media management statute currently being drafted in accordance with
similar measures in the Copyright Law.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came a day after the release of a 471-page report
on foreign trade barriers compiled by the U.S. Trade Representative
(USTR) Office. The 10 pages dedicated to Taiwan detail U.S. concerns
for trade barriers in such major areas as intellectual property
rights and the island's telecommunications market.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the report, the USTR Office is
scheduled to publish its annual list of countries that require close
monitoring and could be subject to trade sanctions under the Special
301 provisions of the 1989 U.S. Omnibus Trade Act if the countries
fail to address U.S. concerns.</P>
      <P>Chen said the United States has demanded that Taiwan impose
stricter laws to discourage CD piracy, which he said has become so
rampant that pirated music CDs are sometimes available before the
official products have actually hit the local market.</P>
      <P>Officials in Taipei have speculated that the USTR Office is
likely to include Taiwan on the "priority watch list" of its "Special
301" report this year to turn up the pressure on Taiwan to deal with
intellectual piracy.</P>
      <P>However, the officials have expressed optimism that timely
completion of legislative preparations for the optical media
management statute would keep Taiwan off the "Special 301" priority
watch list, which will be published at the end of April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MOVES TO CRACK DOWN ON MIDDLE EASTERN CON-ARTISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government Sunday
formally launched an inter-division operation to bar Middle Eastern
criminals from entering Taiwan and crack down on them if they are
already here.</P>
      <P>The operation, dubbed the "Sutong Project," is a collaborative
action conducted by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) and the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) to cut down on the number of
crimes committed by con artists from the Middle East, said officials
from the MOI's National Police Administration (NPA).</P>
      <P>The operation was designed in the wake of a spate of thefts and
burglaries committed by people from the Middle East and reported by
Taiwan's department stores and jewelry shops in recent months.</P>
      <P>According to the NPA officials, the Middle Eastern con artists
usually enter Taiwan on tourist visas for short stays of three to
seven days using forged passports.</P>
      <P>After they commit the crimes, they immediately fence the stolen
goods before exiting Taiwan with the cash, NPA officials noted.</P>
      <P>MOFA authorities, meanwhile, note that according to their
investigations, most of the Middle Eastern crooks use Thailand as
their operations base, and obtain their visas from Taiwan's
representative or liaison offices in Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and
the Philippines.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said that from now on, all Middle Eastern
applicants for Taiwan entry visas will have to provide an additional
bust photo for each visa application to make it easier for
immigration authorities to identify them when they enter or exit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's immigration authorities will be able to identify the
visitors more easily if they use identical photos with different
names and different passports, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>Under the operation, the NPA authorities will be responsible for
building an archive of Middle Eastern people who have committed
crimes on the island over the past five years.</P>
      <P>The NPA authorities will also notify the island's car leasing
companies, hotels and motels that all patronage or temporary stays by
visitors from the Middle East must be immediately reported to police
authorities. The requirement is designed to allow airport and customs
police enough time and sufficient evidence to nab the unlawful,
according to the NPA.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Kuomintang caucus in the
Legislative Yuan Sunday voiced strong criticism of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) primaries held across the island
the same day.</P>
      <P>Legislator Cheng Yung-chin, KMT Legislative caucus head, said
that rumors of bribery, falsified identities of party members, and
ghost party memberships have been spreading since the primaries were
announced.</P>
      <P>Cheng called on eligible voters to open their eyes before casting
their votes in the elections for legislators, magistrates and mayors
scheduled for Dec. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that DPP has always declared its opposition to
election bribery, but bribe rumors have been spreading since the
primaries were announced last December.</P>
      <P>In addition, the DPP-led government has not done well in the past
year since it assumed power on May 20, 2000, Cheng said. Taiwan's
economy is in a drastic decline, the unemployment rate is soaring and
social security is worsening, the KMT legislator said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT will hold party primaries in May, Cheng
claimed that the party is opposed to "black gold", bribery, and
violence and will punish all those who violate primary regulations.</P>
      <P>Cheng also predicted that none of three largest political parties
will win half of the seats in the Legislative Yuan in the yearend
election. But he predicted that the KMT would win 90 to 100
Legislative seats.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CD-R MAKERS SAY FEES CHARGED BY PHILIPS TOO HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's CD-R manufacturers took concerted
action Sunday to protest against what they say are the overly high
fees charged by Philips Electronics Inc. for the use of its patented
technology in their production of CD-Rs.</P>
      <P>The manufacturers said the exorbitant fees have sharply increased
their production costs and weakened their products' market
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Ritek Corp., one of Taiwan's major CD-R manufacturers, said that
when the selling price of CD-R was US$3-4 a piece, Philips charged
each Taiwan CD-R manufacturer 300 Japanese yen (US$2.72) per piece.</P>
      <P>Ritek officials said that although Philips has significantly
reduced the fee along with the decline in CD-R prices, the charges
are still too high.</P>
      <P>They noted that CD-R prices have dropped to between US$0.20 to
US$0.25 per piece at present from US$0.70 per unit in 1999. With
Philips charging 10 Japanese yen (US$0.083) per piece, the fee
accounts for 32 percent to 41 percent of a CD-R manufacturer's
production costs, seriously affecting the product's competitiveness,
they added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's CD-R manufacturers reportedly plan to file a complaint
with Philips' legal adviser in a bid to obtain a satisfactory
solution to the matter.</P>
      <P>They also plan to file a petition Monday with the Cabinet-level

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO CONTINUE PROMOTING CROSS-STRAIT TIES FOR ASIA PEACE: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed the
Republic of China's commitment Sunday to forging rapprochement
across the Taiwan Strait for the sake of maintaining peace,
stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks at a "world citizens
forum" organized by the World Citizens Assembly (WCA). The forum
was held at the Taipei International Convention Center.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait relations are vital to the Asia-Pacific
situation, Chen said the ROC has consistently promoted goodwill
exchanges with mainland China in a realistic manner in hopes of
contributing to regional peace and security.</P>
      <P>"And we look forward to seeing mainland China face up to the
reality that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are now
ruled by separate governments," Chen said, adding that he hopes the
two sides can resume regular dialogue on an equal, reciprocal basis
to jointly create a "win-win" scenario.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say he believes that pursuing the common values
of human rights and democracy can help reduce conflicts and bring
peace to the world.</P>
      <P>He further said the ROC, as a constructive member of the Global
Village, is more than willing to play an active role in
international organizations and world affairs to contribute to
progress in world civilization.</P>
      <P>The president also said he is very delighted to see the World
Citizens Assembly convene its first plenary meeting in the 21st
century in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It marks the WCA's determination to continue working for
international peace and prosperity and for curbing global conflict,"
Chen said, adding that for its part, the ROC will do its utmost to
help boost world harmony and progress.</P>
      <P>President Chen also recognized the WCA's long-term efforts to
boost world peace and the common well-being of mankind. He said the
ROC government and people warmly welcome all delegates to the WCA
meeting, many of whom have traveled halfway round the world to come
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the past five decades, Chen went on, the ROC has achieved
economic prosperity through concerted efforts of its government and

    <HEADLINE>DALAI LAMA CHALLENGES BEIJING TO WATCH HIS ACTIVITIES IN TAIWAN: CBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  March  31  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's national broadcasting network
noted Saturday that Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama,
challenged Beijing's leaders to watch his activities in Taiwan, as he
has nothing to hide.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said the Buddhist monk arrived in
Taiwan on Saturday. "Speaking to a packed news conference, he said he
has nothing to hide from Beijing, which has accused him of colluding
with the island's separatists," the CBC said.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama has repeatedly said he is not seeking Tibetan
independence from China, which has ruled his Himalayan homeland with
an iron fist since 1950, the CBC noted.</P>
      <P>In a Taipei-datelined report, the CBC quoted the Tibetan leader
as saying China's rigid authoritarian system is not the answer to the
huge country's many problems.</P>
      <P>The spiritual leader's 10-day visit to Taiwan has inflamed
political and religious passions on the island of 23 million. He was
greeted by both supporters and protesters on arrival at Taiwan's
airport, the CBC said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SENATOR URGES SALES OF REQUESTED WEAPONS TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  1  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. senator has urged the Bush
administration to sell all the weapons systems that Taiwan has
requested, stressing that increasing the preparedness of Taiwan's
defense forces "will decrease the chances that the United States will
need to become involved in a conflict in the Taiwan Straits, or that
such a conflict will occur in the first place."</P>
      <P>Addressing the Senate floor Friday, Senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.)
said that "not only do we need to sell Taiwan the necessary military
equipment for defense against China, our defense officials and
military personnel need to be able to work with their Taiwanese
counterparts to ensure that they know how to use the equipment."</P>
      <P>"Our long-term goal is to live in peace and prosperity with the
Chinese people, as well as to promote democratic transition in that
country. China's far-reaching ambitions in Asia, coupled with efforts
to modernize and strengthen its military force, however, require the
United States to exercise leadership," Kyl said.</P>
      <P>He noted that there is no doubt that Communist China will and
should play a larger role on the world stage in the coming years, but
"the challenge before us is to deal with this emerging power in a way
that enhances our security by dealing candidly and strongly with some
of the troubling facts and trends. It is time to take a more
clear-eyed approach to dealing with China."</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration believed that Communist China could be
reformed solely by the influence of the West. Unfortunately, Kyl
said, this theory has not proved true, adding that Beijing's embrace
of Western-style capitalism has not been accompanied by respect for
human rights, the rule of law, true democratization, or a less
belligerent attitude toward its neighbors.</P>
      <P>"Indeed, serious problems with China have grown worse. And
continuing to gloss over these problems for fear of disrupting the
fragile U.S.-China relationship, primarily for trade reasons, only
exacerbates the problems," emphasized the senator.</P>
      <P>Kyl then quoted Secretary of State Colin Powell as saying in his
confirmation hearing that "I believe it is in our best interest to
seriously evaluate China's military strategy, plans for modernization
of its People's Liberation Army, including the expansion of its ICBM
capability, and buildup of forces opposite Taiwan. Let us not risk
underestimating China's intentions or capabilities, possibly finding
ourselves in the midst of a conflict we could have prevented."

    <HEADLINE>U.S. NAVY RECOMMENDS SELLING AEGIS DESTROYERS TO TAIWAN: N.Y. TIMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang &amp; Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Taiwan needs a significant infusion of
new weapons, including a sophisticated ship-borne radar system for
Aegis-class Destroyers", the New York Times quoted a U.S. naval
confidential review as reporting Sunday.</P>
      <P>The review was an assessment report made by U.S. Pacific Fleet
officers who had visited Taiwan to assess its naval requirements in
light of Beijing's military buildup, the paper said.</P>
      <P>The review pointed out that in addition to procuring the Aegis
class destroyer's sophisticated radar system by 2010, Taiwan also
needs Kidd-class destroyers as a "stopgap." The review also concluded
that Taiwan needs new submarines as well as an underwater sonar array
to detect Chinese submarines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also been in discussions on the new Patriot
anti-missile system known as PAC-3, and similar studies have been
carried out concerning other parts of Taiwan's military, the Times
reported.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Naval Officers believe that the year 2010 will be
important because it will take at least eight years or "more to
agree on a configuration of the Aegis radar system for Taiwan's
navy, build the ship and integrate it into Taiwan's naval fleet," the
report added.</P>
      <P>"Experts familiar with the officers' review say it concludes that
by 2010 Taiwan will need vessels equipped with long-range
surface-to-air missiles, a sophisticated battle management system and
a phased-array radar, which is the hallmark of the Aegis system," the
Times reported.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said Sunday his party insists on adopting a
rational political style and will never take to streets simply for
partisan purposes.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks in response to a suggestion by some
people that the PFP took to streets in protest of a recent
physical assault on PFP Legislator Diane Lee by independent lawmaker
Lo Fu-chu during a legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Soong rejected the proposal, saying that the PFP does not want to
copy the strategy adopted by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
before it came to power last year.</P>
      <P>Noting that the PFP harbors no grievances, Soong said the party
will adhere to its rational, no-nonsense political style. "We'll
never take to streets for short-term partisan gains. We'll honor our
commitment to working for the common well-being of all local
people."</P>
      <P>Soong reminded local politicians that Taiwan's party politics
has undergone significant changes following last year's presidential
election.</P>
      <P>"Local voters have become ever more independent-minded. They
will no longer blindly toe party lines," Soong noted, adding that
many local politicians have not yet discerned this great
change.</P>
      <P>He went on to say the results of last year's [residential
election indicated that 60 percent of local voters support the PFP
and the Kuomintang's policy on promoting rapprochement across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The electoral outcome also showed that 70 percent of local
voters want sweeping domestic reforms," Soong said. "Against this
backdrop, the PFP will continue upholding its reformist platform
and rational political style."</P>
      <P>Soong also reminded the current DPP government that local
people's patience has its limit. "Our voters can no longer wait.
The DPP government should speed up political reform, judicial reform
and parliamentary reform to wipe out corruption and ensure clean
politics," he urged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PURSUING SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT TO ENSURE WORLD PEACE: DALAI LAMA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,  Taiwan,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dalai Lama said here Sunday
that all people around the world should pay more heed to human values
after enjoying material affluence.</P>
      <P>"Only continued pursuit of spiritual enlightenment can achieve
real world peace," the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader said in a
speech on "Ethics in the New Millennium" delivered at the Linkou
Stadium in the northern Taiwan county of Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>Addressing a packed audience, the Dalai Lama said love and
compassion would be the remedy to cure the illness carried over from
the old millennium.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Tibetan and English, the Dalai Lama said history has
shown that the ceaseless efforts to push for progress in materials
over the past century has brought human beings to nowhere. "Instead
there were pains after pains troubling human beings."</P>
      <P>The winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize went on to say that
while the fast pace of development in science, technology and
economics had made the world a smaller place and brought human
relations closer, many people are still on the fringes of society.</P>
      <P>"So we must not continue to tread the traditional path if we are
to solve the lingering problems ... We have to adopt a more
open-minded attitude," he said, adding: "Love is critical ... and
remember, when anyone gives love to another, happiness emerges from
their mind, and they then are the biggest beneficiaries."</P>
      <P>Citing his experiences of meeting a number of the world's richest
men who despite their material wealth said they felt lacking in
spirituality, the Nobel laureate said he had asked them to be more
caring towards others. "In this way one would have his mind be
occupied by happiness," he said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Vice President Annette Lu said
it's an honor for the people of Taiwan to have the highly respected
spiritual leader Dalai Lama to visit the Republic of China again. The
Dalai Lama visited Taiwan for the first time in 1997.</P>
      <P>Thanks to his presence, Lu said, "different peoples and 10-odd
religions were brought together here."</P>
      <P>A joint prayer, attended by leaders of varied religions including 
Christian, Catholics and Taoism, immediately followed the Dalai
Lama's speech to pray for the well-being of the ROC and its
people.</P>
      <P>Before his speech, the Dalai Lama held a brief "purification
ceremony" to drive away any evil spirits away from the stadium and to
let in Buddha.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of policemen were deployed in and around the stadium, and the 
crowd was required to pass through a metal-detector at the entrance.</P>
      <P>Under police protection normally granted to a national leader, the Dalai 
Lama was driven from his hotel to the stadium some 40 kilometers (24 miles) 
south of Taipei in a black limousine.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day he met with 100-plus Tibetans, including some
illegal immigrants who asked for his assistance to secure them legal
residence status in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India since the failure
of an anti-China uprising in Tibet in 1959, arrived in Taipei
Saturday for a 10-day "religious visit." He is scheduled to meet with
President Chen Shui-bian on April 5 for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>On Sunday evening, the Dalai Lama paid a visit to the Taipei
City Hall where Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou presented him a "Key to
Taipei" as a gift.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou presented a "Key
to Taipei" to Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama Sunday, saying
that "the city always welcomes you and is always opened to you."</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, who arrived in Taipei Saturday for a 10-day
religious trip, met with Ma at the Taipei City Hall after delivering
a speech at the Linkou Stadium.</P>
      <P>He told Ma that despite their different traditions in Chinese,
Japanese and Buddhist teachings, "they can learn and understand one
another."</P>
      <P>The winner of the 1989 Nobel Prize for Peace also encouraged the
people of Taiwan "to overcome all difficulties with confidence,
wisdom, perseverance and patience."</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama described as "encouraging" the fact that lots of
people in Taiwan have interest in Buddhism, and pointed out that his
current visit will be complementary to the exchange of Chinese and
Tibetan Buddhism.</P>
      <P>He lauded the island's achievements in political democracy,
education and economic development, especially the pace of
democratization.</P>
      <P>Several ranking Taipei City officials were also present at the
meeting. They included Taipei City Council Vice Speaker Fei
Hung-tai, Civil Affairs Bureau Director Lin Cheng-hsiu and Cultural
Affairs Bureau Director Lung Ying-tai.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Business League of Central Taiwan
donated NT$1.11 million (US$33,846) to India on Monday to help
victims of a devastating earthquake that jolted that country earlier
this year.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the business league presented the cash
donation to Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu as a token to
echo Lu's recent calls for the display of "compassion toward India."</P>
      <P>Accepting the cash aid on behalf of the Indian earthquake
victims, Lu said this donation is particularly touching and
significant as the people of central Taiwan themselves were the
victims of a killer quake in 1999. That temblor claimed more then
2,000 lives and caused a countless amount of property damage, and
central Taiwan has still not fully recovered from the devastation, Lu
noted.</P>
      <P>In March, Taiwan's EVA Airways carried US$270,000 worth of relief
goods to India for the same purpose. The donation of relief goods, by
Taiwan-based air carriers and shippers, was also made in response to
Lu's appeal to the people of Taiwan to help quake victims in India.</P>
      <P>India suffered its deadliest earthquake in 50 years on Jan. 26
when a quake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale rattled the western
state of Gujarat, killing some 25,000 people.</P>
      <P>India maintains no diplomatic relations with the Republic of

    <HEADLINE>'GO SLOW' POLICY REVIEW ALREADY REFERRED TO CABINET: MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has
sent a comprehensive review of the "no haste, be patient" policy on
mainland China-bound investment to the Cabinet for approval and
implementation, a senior official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan interior
affairs committee meeting, MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said the MAC
has suggested in the report that mainland China-bound investment
projects worth more than US$50 million each be screened and approved
on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>The government's top mainland policy planner explained that the
main consideration of the "no haste" or "go slow" policy review
focuses on more reasonably reflecting the demand of the Taiwan
economy and industries.</P>
      <P>"And it's up to the Executive Yuan (Cabinet) to decide when the
adjusted mainland investment policy will be put into force," Tsai
told lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The "go slow" policy was formulated by the former Kuomintang
government with a view to cooling off enthusiastic mainland
investment fever among local business people. Under the policy,
high-technology enterprises are banned from investing in mainland
China and capital investment of any single project should not
exceed US$50 million.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan, mainland and global economic trends changing
rapidly, the local business community has been pushing the
current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government to adjust the
"go slow" policy and ease mainland investment restrictions.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "go slow" policy is critical to Taiwan's
industrial development, Tsai said the government must exercise
prudence and wisdom in implementing the policy.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the MAC and other relevant government agencies have
reviewed the "go slow" policy in line with the two
principles directed by President Chen Shui-bian -- openness and
effective management.</P>
      <P>"In formulating new regulatory measures, we have placed priority
on ensuring transparency and reasonableness to facilitate
realization of our policy goals of better 'risk management' and
'keeping business roots' in Taiwan," Tsai explained.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the "go slow" policy review also includes
easing restrictions on the items that local enterprises will be
allowed to invest on the mainland as well as the establishment of a
capital risk management mechanism and a capital inflow system for the
return of Taiwan firms' earnings from mainland operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai told the legislators that the government is
scheduled to complete an overall review and planning by the end of
June for the proposal to allow mainland people to make sightseeing
tours of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the new "open-door" policy will be implemented in a
gradual manner based on several basic principles -- imposing a quota
system, "group in and group out," and adopting necessary
complementary measures to ensure national security and stability.</P>
      <P>"Opening the door to mainland tourists must comply with our
overall mainland policy and formulate relevant complementary
measures to safeguard our national security," Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, Tsai said, the new opening measure is
expected to bring Taiwan an economic bonanza worth some NT$20 billion
(US$613.5 million).</P>
      <P>Tsai further stressed that the opening of Taiwan's tourist
market to mainland visitors is mainly aimed at promoting mutual
understanding between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"In consideration of national security, we'll carry out the new
open-door policy in an orderly and gradual manner," she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>10-DAY SHOW FEATURING MAN LIVING WITH POISONOUS SNAKES DISCONTINUED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An event featuring "a man living with
poisonous snakes for 240 hours" was discontinued after Justice
Minister Chen Ting-nan reported the "death game" to police in
accordance with what he termed his "obligations as a citizen."</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to the recent spine-chilling show sponsored by
several underground shops in celebration of the first anniversary of
their opening.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-feng, the 28-year old man from Pingtung who took the
challenge to live for 10 days with poisonous snakes in a small
glass-walled room for a prize of NT$1 million (US$30,300), if he
survived, had signed a declaration stating that he was voluntarily
taking part in the event.</P>
      <P>The event had attracted many spectators to the small transparent
show room each day since it began last Friday. Several of Lin's
family members went to the site of the event Sunday to tearfully try
to persuade him to discontinue the stunt.</P>
      <P>After seeing media reports about the event, the justice minister
also went to the scene Sunday to express his concern. He later
informed police, who then arrived to remove Lin from the "snake den"
for questioning.</P>
      <P>Chen told the media Monday that he was only fulfilling his duty
as a citizen, suggesting to police that such an exhibition was in
violation of regulations safeguarding social order. The specific
regulation he was referring to states that anyone who performs an
action in public that violates public decency laws will be subject to
detention for up to three days or to a maximum fine of NT$12,000
(US$364).</P>
      <P>The justice minister also noted that Lin is not bound to the
contract he signed, saying that under the law, "any actions or
documents that run counter to public order or decency will be
invalid."</P>
      <P>Chen said the sponsor told him that some of the snakes that were
in the same room with Lin are so lethal that if Lin were bitten, it
is likely that no serum would have been able to save him and he would
have most probably died.</P>
      <P>Chen lamented that such "death games" have been used
commercially in Taiwan, saying that these kind of events obviously
run counter to the maintenance of social order.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that he only suggested to police that such
hazardous games be discontinued and that he did not give them
specific instructions.</P>
      <P>Police have now turned the case over to the Taipei Prosecutor's
Office.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A granddaughter of Republic of China
founder Dr. Sun Yat-sen on Monday called for collaboration between
the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP), two of
Taiwan's opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Sun Shui-fang, who lives in the United States, said the KMT and
the PFP should tie up as they share a common political philosophy
based on the "Three Principles of the People" advocated by her
grandfather.</P>
      <P>Sun, who is currently in Taipei for meetings, made the remarks
while calling on PFP Chairman James Soong at the party's
headquarters.</P>
      <P>Calling for esprit de corps among all political parties in
Taiwan, Sun said that Dr. Sun Yat-sen is the founding father of all
the people of the Chinese race and that his thoughts, showcased by
the "Three Principles of the People," are thoughts for every Chinese
person regardless of their political affiliations.</P>
      <P>The "Three Principles of the People" is the intellectual property
of all the Chinese people, she stressed.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech she delivered late last month at the First

      <P>In response to Sun's call for cooperation between the KMT and the
PFP, PFP Chairman James Soong noted that the PFP should strive to
build its own sovereignty as a political party and that its success
should not rely on cooperation with certain other parties or be at
the mercy of certain other parties' failures.</P>
      <P>Soong also said he expects that the KMT, the PFP and the ruling

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T TO THINK OVER "APPROPRIATE" TIME FOR TRIMMING STATE ENTERPRISES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi said Monday
that the current economic situation is not too good and that the
ministry will think over what the "appropriate" moment is for
trimming down state-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while reporting to a legislative committee
on the substantial measures taken by the ministry to deal with the
sluggish domestic economy and rising unemployment.</P>
      <P>Legislators from across the political spectrum asked questions
about whether state-owned enterprises will layoff staff or cut
salaries, with some legislators suggesting that layoffs would
exacerbate the domestic unemployment problems.</P>
      <P>Legislators Huang Mu-tien and Lee Chia-chin from the opposition
Kuomintang said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs should shoulder
a greater responsibility for the high unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>Lin retorted that "even a god could not solve the problem" as it
is the result of external factors, adding that his ministry can only
provide relief.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chia-chin noted that seven out of 12 state-owned
enterprises have been losing money, asking whether layoffs or salary
cuts are imminent.</P>
      <P>Lin responded by saying that the pace of privatization of
state-owned enterprises has been dragging on for several years,
noting that losses have widened as this process has dragged on.</P>
      <P>Each state-owned enterprise will have to consider laying off
staff, cutting salaries, merging with other companies or soliciting
outside investors when they formulate their plans of action, or else
they will have no chance of survival, said Lin. He added that the
staff of China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) has agreed to a plan that
includes some layoffs and salary cuts.</P>
      <P>Asked if such moves will only make the domestic unemployment
situation worse, Lin said that having state-owned enterprises
continue to lose money is not a viable option. He did say that as the
timing for slimming down such enterprises is not good, the ministry
will work out when will be a more suitable time for implementing such
measures, pointing out that such moves are necessary in the long run.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
taking care of the elderly is tantamount to taking care of the
general populace, and letting the elderly lead healthy and
comfortable lives with dignity will allow the greater population to
lead lives of the same quality.</P>
      <P>Chen called for a concerted islandwide effort to build Taiwan
into a caring society in which the government is aided by the private
sector's vast resources in its efforts to raise the island's standard
of living and allow all people to look forward to a good future.</P>
      <P>Addressing an audience at the Presidential Office in honor of a
group of voluntary workers who devote their money, energy and time to
bolstering the well-being of the elderly, Chen said senior citizen
policy is now one of the most pressing and important tasks that the
government is facing. Taiwan society is increasingly graying and the
elderly already constitute 8 percent of the entire population.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the government map out proper social welfare
plans to improve care for the elderly and widen senior citizen's

    <HEADLINE>ROC KEEPS CLOSE WATCH ON U.S.-MAINLAND AIRCRAFT COLLISION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government is closely
watching the repercussions of a midair collision between a U.S. spy
plane and a mainland Chinese fighter jet over the South China Sea on
Sunday, government spokesman Su Cheng-ping said Monday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the collision was an accident involving mainland
Chinese and U.S. aircraft, Su said the incident and its repercussions
have no direct correlation with the ROC.</P>
      <P>He added that nevertheless the incident is likely to have a grave
impact on regional development and stability if it is not handled
properly.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, the government is keeping a close watch on the
development of the incident," Su said in response to a press inquiry
about the government's views on the incident.</P>
      <P>Su said the Ministry of National Defense (MND) presented a report
on the incident to the Cabient shortly after it happened, but he
declined to elaborate on the report's details.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen
said the council has made a comprehensive review of the incident and
its possible developments and impact on the Asia-Pacific and Taiwan
Strait situations. The MAC charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China.</P>
      <P>To her knowledge, Tsai said, other government agencies are also
evaluating the possible impact of the incident from different angles
based on their own functions.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the situation could worsen if the United
States and mainland China fail to handle the issue in an appropriate
manner. Tsai said she is hopeful that both sides will exercise
self-restraint in dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>Tsai further said it is premature to forecast at this moment
whether the incident will have any impact on the relationship between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) also refused to comment on
whether the incident would affect the upcoming talks with the United
States on the ROC's arms procurement plans.</P>
      <P>MND officials said they are closely monitoring the development of
the incident through various channels and will work out measures to
cope with the possible impact on ROC-U.S. arms talks scheduled to
take place in Washington, D.C. later this month.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, MND
Deputy Minister Kao Yang said how the incident will affect U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan depends on how quickly the incident can be resolved.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports said U.S. officials on Monday headed
to the mainland Chinese island of Hainan, where a U.S. Navy
surveillance plane and its 24-member crew made an emergency landing
after a midair collision with a mainland fighter Sunday.</P>
      <P>The United States said it expects mainland China to return the
EP-3 surveillance aircraft and its crew -- and underscored that the
plane is considered U.S. territory under international law.</P>
      <P>"The entire aircraft is considered sovereign U.S. territory, and
the Chinese are not to seize, inspect or board it without U.S.
permission," said Lt. Commander Sean Kelly, a spokesman for the U.S.
Pacific Command in Honolulu.</P>
      <P>"As far as we know, they have not boarded the plane," he said.
The EP-3 contains classified electronic eavesdropping equipment.</P>
      <P>A mainland Chinese pilot has reportedly been missing since the
accident.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing,  April 2 (CNA)
(By Fang Hsu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of lawmakers from the Republic of
China's opposition People First Party (PFP) met with mainland
Chinese officials Monday to exchange views on the opening of direct
"three links" across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The seminar was chaired by Sun Yafu, vice president of Beijing's
quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), which is authorized to handle exchanges with Taiwan in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>In addition to ARATS staff, officials from mainland China's
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Ministry of
Information Technology and Telecom Industries, and the Civil
Aviation Administration of China also attended the forum to
signify Beijing's intention to push for early opening of direct
cross-strait trade, mail and transport links, commonly known as the
"major three links."</P>
      <P>The six-member PFP delegation is headed by veteran Legislator Liu
Sung-fan, also a former president of the ROC's Legislative Yuan, or
parliament.</P>
      <P>Liu said the opening of the "major three links" is in the
interests of the governments and people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait. "Therefore, we hope that political and technical obstacles
to the opening of the 'major three links' can be removed as early as
possible," he added.</P>
      <P>Liu further said a main purpose of the PFP delegation's current
visit is to collect first-hand information about mainland China's
opinions and policy regarding the "major three links."</P>
      <P>"The findings or results of our present trip will be used as
reference for the formulation of our party platform in preparation
for Taiwan's year-end elections for legislators and local government
chiefs.</P>
      <P>The visiting PFP legislators are scheduled to meet with mainland
Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen Tuesday for wide-ranging talks.
Following its Beijing visit, the group will travel to Tianjin and
Xian for fact-finding visits.</P>
      <P>The PFP legislative delegation arrived in Beijing Sunday and is
scheduled to return to Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the delegation only represents the PFP, Liu said it
current mainland visit has nothing to do with the ROC government.</P>
      <P>Liu said issues related to the "major three links" are the main
concern of the group's present mainland visit.</P>
      <P>"We hope to find a solution that can help break the current
cross-strait impasse," Liu said, adding that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should use wisdom to resolve their disputes and mend
their differences through peaceful dialogue.</P>
      <P>In his view, Liu said the ROC's DPP-led government should
consider recognizing the 1992 consensus on "one China, separate
interpretations" as a starting point to facilitate resumption
of cross-strait dialogue and improvement of bilateral ties.</P>

      <P>According to last year's poll, 23 percent of the respondents
have invested in five Southeast Asian countries -- Malaysia, the
Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore. About
18 percent said they have invested in the United States.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 39.4 percent of Taiwan-financed
companies managed to post earnings from their mainland operations
last year, compared to 30.7 percent who said their mainland
businesses were still operating in the red.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the ratio of profitable mainland
operations exceeded that of money-losing businesses, MOEA officials
said, adding the figures indicated that Taiwan investors' operations
on the mainland have been improving.</P>
      <P>The survey further discovered that Taiwan-financed firms on the
mainland have become less dependent on Taiwan for the supplies of
raw materials, parts or semi-finished products.</P>
      <P>In last year's survey, only 43.2 percent said they relied on
Taiwan for the supplies of raw materials and semi-finished products,
compared to 44.7 percent who said they secured raw materials and
parts from the mainland market.</P>
      <P>The figures indicated that Taiwan investors have increasingly
relied on mainland suppliers for raw materials and parts as their
new strategy to cut production costs and attract identification of
mainland consumers, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOEA officials said mainland China remained the No. 1
overseas investment destination for Taiwan entrepreneurs. Compared
with similar MOEA surveys conducted in 1996, 1998 and 1999, the
percentages of mainland China-bound investors to firms with overseas
investments were 72.7 percent, 71.1 percent and 69.1 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In addition to its cheap labor and land, MOEA officials
said, mainland China has become even more attractive to Taiwan
investors in the past few years because of several fresh
reasons, including the wave of economic globalization, Taipei's
and Beijing's imminent accession to the World Trade Organization and
the U.S. granting to Beijing of permanent normal trade
relations (PNTR).</P>
      <P>The latest MOEA survey also found that 55.9 percent of Taiwan
investors in mainland China have posted gains in their business
turnover over the past year, and that more than 60 percent of those
who have invested in Vietnam, Thailand and Hong Kong have also seen
increases in their overseas business volumes.</P>
      <P>Survey results further showed that 72 percent of companies with
overseas investments said their domestic business turnover still
exceeded their overseas business volume. More than 40 percent of
large enterprises said their overseas turnover accounted for less
than 10 percent of their total annual business volumes, indicating
that most large business groups have kept their business roots in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 47 percent of small- and medium-sized enterprises
have seen their overseas turnover exceed their domestic business
volumes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT WILL TRY TO CUT JOBLESS RATE: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reiterated his
concern over rising unemployment Monday, saying that the Cabinet will
seek to cut the jobless rate.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks when he presided over a meeting and
listened to a report by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) on how to
step up the use of an employment stabilization fund to promote
employment around the nation.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the Executive Yuan has adopted various
measures to deal with the unemployment problem, such as easing
housing loan repayments for the jobless, providing short-term
unemployment benefit and providing health insurance.</P>
      <P>The government is also seeking to cooperate with the private
sector to improve the investment environment, ease regulations
governing employment contracts, promote the restructuring of
enterprises, upgrade business competitiveness and strengthen the
country's economic structure.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the lackluster economy and the fast adjustment
of the industrial structure have combined to make the employment
market bleaker.</P>
      <P>He said that his government knows that the jobless problem is not
simple, but involves the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of
families, and added that stimulating the economy and cutting the
jobless rate is a priority of his Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The high domestic jobless rate of 3.71 percent in February has
been cause for alarm, prompting Chang to convene a meeting March 26
of the heads of the Council of Economic Planning and Development,
Ministry of Finance, CLA, Department of Health, the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission and the Council of Aboriginal
Affairs.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian also expressed his concern about the
rising jobless rate when he presided over a nine-person policymaking
team March 27 and instructed the premier to adopt related measures to
cut the jobless rate.</P>

      <P>Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi predicted
Monday that the local economy might recover in the third or fourth
quarter of this year, while the U.S. economy should recover in the
fourth quarter of 2001.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks when he answered interpellation questions
raised by members of the Economic and Energy Committee in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Ching-pao (KMT-Kinmen County) asked Lin whether
he will allow his salary to be cut, which employees of state-run
enterprises have done due to what he called their poor performance.
Lin rejected Chen's statement, insisting that some state-run
enterprises have turned a deficit into a surplus.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Mu-tien (KMT-Taoyuan County) said that the
Ministry of Economic Affairs should bear the responsibility for the
high local unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>Lin replied that his ministry could only do so much in the
current international economic climate. "Even God couldn't figure a
way out of this situation," he said.</P>
      <P>Answering another question from Lin Sheng-liang (KMT-Taipei
County), Lin Hsin-yi predicted that the local economy would begin
recovering during the third or fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Pao-chih, chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, expressed the hope that June's unemployment
rate will not surpass 4 percent.</P>
      <P>However, Legislator Weng Chin-chu (DPP-Changhua County)
pessimistically said that June's jobless rate will surpass 5 percent.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China will improve ties
with the Tibetan government-in-exile in India, despite the "fact"
that Tibet is technically still a part of the ROC, Chairman Hsu
Cheng-kuang of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission said
Monday.</P>
      <P>In a report on the commission's agenda to the Legislative Yuan,
Hsu admitted that there have been misunderstandings between his
commission and the Dalai Lama's government caused by "the burden of
history and the lack of channels of contact between the two sides."</P>
      <P>However, Hsu said his commission will broaden contacts with the
exiled Tibetan government and provide services to Tibetan people on
the principle of humanitarianism.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that his commission did not invite the Dalai Lama, who
arrived on the island Sunday for a 10-day visit, but said it had been
consulted by the government on how to receive the Tibetan spiritual
leader.</P>
      <P>As for the 100-odd Tibetan refugees currently in Taiwan, Hsu said
amnesty would be an option to grant them residence rather than
revising the existing laws, which would require a "troublesome"
overall review of related regulations.</P>

Party (PFP) reaffirmed Monday that PFP will take its own development
direction.</P>
      <P>James Soong pointed out that the development and growth of the
party will not depend on cooperation with other political parties or
on the failure of another party.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a meeting with Sun Shui-fong -- the
grand-daughter of Republic of China founder Dr. Sun Yat-sen -- who
called on Soong at PFP headquarters.</P>
      <P>In response to media speculation that the PFP will cooperate with
the opposition Kuomintang, Soong said that the PFP should rely on its
own hard work to serve the public.</P>
      <P>Soong noted that local political commentators have said that
President Chen Shui-bian's success in the presidential election of
March 18, 2000 resulted from the splitting of the KMT, adding that if
the KMT cooperates with the PFP, the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) would have no future.</P>
      <P>Predicting the outcome of the elections of legislators and
magistrates scheduled to be held Dec. 1, 2001, Soong said the three
largest political parties -- the KMT, the DPP and the PFP -- are all
unlikely to get fewer than 100 seats and more than 40.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the possibility of cooperation between the KMT and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official of Taiwan's Central Bank
of China predicted Monday that the yen's depreciation trend is
unlikely to trigger another Asian financial storm.</P>
      <P>Chou A-ting, director-general of the bank's Foreign Exchange
Department, said that Japanese trading figures are not in the red, as
was the case of Thailand in 1997.</P>
      <P>Thailand relied almost entirely on foreign capital, which carries
great inherent risks, he said, adding that most nations are now more
alert about capital flow and short-term foreign capital.</P>
      <P>He speculated that the yen fell to a 30-month low against the
greenback earlier in the day mainly as a result of the release of a
quarterly Bank of Japan report that indicated a pessimistic outlook
from Japan's biggest manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Chou added that other Asian currencies will inevitably be
affected, but that they will reflect their own economic fundamentals
eventually.</P>
      <P>He warned that if other Asian countries were to competitively
weaken their currencies, not only would such a move not have the
desired effect of stimulating exports, it would also result in
inflationary pressure.</P>
      <P>Regarding the local currency, Chou said that Taiwan's annual
economic growth rate is above 5 percent, unlike Japan's, which stands
at less than 1 percent. Also, with the net amount of foreign
investment in March maintaining a moderate level of between US$500
million to US$1 billion, he continued, the new Taiwan dollar is
unlikely to follow in the yen's footsteps.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PETROLEUM DEMAND RELIES ON IMPORTS: CPC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April  2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) Chairman
C.W. Chen said Monday that Taiwan relies heavily on foreign imports
of petroleum and natural gas to meet local demand.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan produces some petroleum and natural
gas, Chen said the island's scant production is not enough to cover
domestic consumption due to the cost of oil and gas exploration. He
noted that 99 percent of Taiwan's oil and gas needs are met through
imports.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while answering questions from lawmakers
Liao Fu-pen and Yu Cheng-tao at a legislative committee meeting after
paying an inspection trip to the CPC's construction of a liquid
natural gas (LNG) storage tank in Yungan, Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Citing a written report on the Yungan LNG plant, Liao said that
the plant authorities are carrying out the third-phase construction
of the storage tank as part of the CPC's efforts to satisfy the local
demand for LNG. According to the report, the CPC's annual LNG
supplies are around 4.5 million tons at present, a figure that is
expected to reach 7.4 million tons in 2007.</P>
      <P>Liao also asked Chen whether Taiwan has the potential to become a
"second Kuwait," because Taiwan and the seabed surrounding it are
rich in petroleum and LNG reserves, according to some information
gleaned from satellites.</P>
      <P>Pouring cold water on Liao's idea, the CPC chairman replied that
while it might be true that there may be 5-6 billion cubic meters of
LNG deposited deep beneath the seabed some 100 nautical miles off the
Kaohsiung coast, the CPC has decided against exploring the reserves
as the expected profits would not be sufficient to offset the cost of
the exploration.</P>
      <P>Currently, the CPC pays up to NT$800 million in exploration fees
per year, he added, noting that petroleum and natural gas are
normally found deep below the earth and are not easily detected by
satellite imaging.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  2 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai
Lama said in Taipei Monday that he wants to pursue "a genuine
autonomy" for Tibet, not independence.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while delivering a speech at the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>The Nobel Prize laureate, who fled Tibet to India in 1959, told
the lawmakers that the present situation in Tibet "is not good for
either Tibet or the People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>"It is a common disaster for both Tibet and the PRC," the Dalai
Lama noted, adding that Tibet's culture, tradition and natural
environment are facing destruction.</P>
      <P>As a spokesman for free Tibetans, the Dalai Lama said that he has
been trying to seek a solution for his homeland -- to have the PRC
grant a genuine autonomy for Tibet.</P>
      <P>He stressed that his personal stance is not to seek Tibetan
independence, but to seek a genuine autonomy.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama said that he will demand nothing from Beijing. "As
I stated before, whether the incarnation system of the Dalai Lama
will continue to exist should be decided by the Tibetans."</P>
      <P>"If they want to maintain the system, then keep it; otherwise,
the system can be abolished," he said.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama said that he has also stated before that in case
he is able to return to Tibet, he wants to hand over the political
power to a government formed through democratic elections.</P>
      <P>During the hour-long speech, the Dalai Lama said that all people
are members of a family and that everyone therefore has the
responsibility of caring about the future of humankind and the earth.</P>
      <P>Before the speech, the Dalai Lama presented a hata to Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the Dalai Lama expounded the meaning of the
"Prajina Paramita" (Heart Sutra) at the Linkou Stadium before a
packed audience.</P>
      <P>He said the foundation of the Buddha's teachings lies in
compassion and added that the reason for practicing the teachings is
to wipe out the persistence of ego, which he termed the number one
enemy of compassion.</P>
      <P>"Compassion and love is the source of external and internal peace
and is also the root of racial survival," said the Dalai Lama, who
arrived in Taipei last Saturday for what has been described as a
10-day "religious trip" at the invitation of the Chinese Buddhist
Association.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. TRADE REP WARNS TAIWAN TO COMPLY WITH TELECOMS TRADE AGREEMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  2  (CNA)
(By Herman Y.C. Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States warned Taiwan and
three other trading partners on Monday to improve compliance with
bilateral trade agreements on telecommunications services or face
possible retaliatory actions.</P>
      <P>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said in a statement
while releasing the annual section 1377 trade report that the United
States will seek "specific action consistent with telecommunications
trade commitments of certain U.S. trading partners."</P>
      <P>He singled out Colombia, Mexico, South Africa and Taiwan as
raising "serious concerns" among U.S officials regarding those
countries' compliance with their telecoms trade obligations.</P>
      <P>The report said that Taiwan's telecommunications sector
regulations have imposed serious limitations on the competitive
offering of telecoms services by U.S. firms and have undermined new
entrants into Taiwan's market.</P>
      <P>"The restrictions also appear to be inconsistent with the
commitments undertaken by Taiwan as part of its bilateral WTO
accession negotiations with the United States to liberalize its
telecommunications market by July 1, 2001," the report said.</P>
      <P>Zoellick warned that if Taiwan does not take the necessary steps
to fulfill its commitments, he will consider "appropriate actions,"
including those contained within section 1374 of the 1988 Trade Act."</P>
      <P>Section 1374 of the 1988 Trade Act requires the U.S. trade
representative to investigate and identify the "priority countries"
with respect to the imposition of trade barriers on U.S. telecoms
companies.</P>
      <P>If a country is identified as a priority country, the president
is then authorized under section 1376 of the same act to take action,
including imposing trade sanctions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will help Taiwan
defend itself, but at this point the Bush administration has still
not made any decision on the question of this year's arms sales to
Taiwan, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Monday.</P>
      <P>McClellan made the remarks at a regular press briefing when asked
what impact Sunday's mid-air collision between a U.S. reconnaissance
plane and a Communist Chinese jet fighter over the South China Sea
would have on Bush's pending decision regarding Taiwan's request for
advanced weapons, including four Arleigh Burke-class Aegis
destroyers.</P>
      <P>McClellan said that "the president has repeatedly iterated our
support for the Taiwan Relations Act, and we will help Taiwan defend
itself."</P>
      <P>He stressed that the focus now is on getting immediate access to
the plane's 24 crew members being held in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Earlier President George W. Bush demanded that Beijing grant the
United States immediate consular access to the 24 crew members of the
U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane and return the plane without any
tampering.</P>
      <P>"I sent a very clear message and I expect them to heed the
message," Bush told reporters at the White House.</P>
      <P>Bush said Beijing's refusal to let U.S. officials talk to the
crew members right away was "inconsistent with customary diplomatic
practices and the desire of both countries for better relations."</P>
      <P>According to McClellan, mainland Chinese officials finally
offered to let U.S. consular officials visit the crew members late
Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>Several American media reports said that Chinese officials had
boarded the U.S. SP-3 reconnaissance jet, but the White House refused
to confirm them. The reports raised concerns about the possibility of
the plane's classified surveillance technology falling into Beijing's
hands.</P>
      <P>Bush insisted that the U.S. plane was on a routine mission in
international airspace when it collided with one of two Chinese F-8
fighter jets shadowing it on Sunday. The plane made an emergency
landing on Hainan Island, located off the southern coast of mainland
China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) reaffirmed Tuesday that Taiwan has faithfully
fulfilled its commitment to liberalize its telecommunications market
as part of its bid to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The officials said the pace of liberalization is actually ahead
of schedule and there is no reason for the U.S. to find fault in this
regard.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks in response to U.S. criticism of
Taiwan in its annual review of telecommunications trade practices in
which it said Taiwan's restrictions undermine the attempts of new
entrants to compete in the domestic telecommunications market and
called into question the country's commitment to liberalize the
sector.</P>
      <P>During a visit to Taiwan last month, a U.S. trade delegation
asked Taiwan to open its fix-lined and undersea cable industries.
This was the latest time that the U.S. complained that Taiwan has not
moved quickly to open its telecommunications markets under the WTO
rules.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Taiwan, responding to the request by the
United States, actually decided to open its undersea cable businesses
last year, and agreed to review to expand rental access to other than
fix-lined operators.</P>
      <P>On the U.S. requests that Taiwan ease its regulations on
fix-lined operations, the officials noted that a telecommunications
liberalization task force is now reviewing all related issues, and
should have a report ready by the end of June.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on U.S. criticism that the threshold for setting up a
fix-lined business is too high at a minimum capital investment of
NT$40 billion (US$1.21 billion), they noted that the local telecom
giant Chung Hwa Telecom Co. has a current yearly surplus of NT$60
billion. If new operators want to compete with Chung Hwa Telecom,
capital of NT$40 billion cannot be considered too high, they said.</P>
      <P>They stressed that Taiwan has carried through with its commitment
to open up the telecommunications market, and there is no reason for
the U.S to find fault with Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A number of Republic of China lawmakers
warned Tuesday that ROC interests may be compromised as a result of
the forced landing of a U.S. surveillance plane in mainland Chinese
territory following a mid-air collision with a mainland fighter.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislator Chou Cheng-chih, a retired
lieutenant general, told reporters that he believes mainland China
will take the opportunity to carefully study the U.S. aircraft's
advanced electronic warfare capabilities and develop ways to counter
them.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that this would be very disadvantageous for
Taiwan if the United States were to decide to sell the island the
same EP-3 or the similar P-3 anti-submarine warfare surveillance
aircraft at the upcoming arms sales talks in Washington.</P>
      <P>Chou claimed that he has privately obtained assurance that the
United States is ready to sell Taiwan the P-3 planes it has
requested, and perhaps even the more advanced EP-3.</P>
      <P>He speculated that Washington and Beijing are unlikely to go to
war over "a little airplane," and that the United States would
certainly join forces with other nations to pressure mainland China
to return the crew members and the plane.</P>
      <P>However, Chou warned that if Washington and Beijing were to
decide to exchange conditions when negotiations over the EP-3 begin,
Taiwan's interests will be the first to be sacrificed.</P>
      <P>In exchange for the safe return of the U.S. crew and aircraft,
Washington might promise Beijing that it will not sell Taiwan the
state-of-the-art Aegis destroyers or diesel-electric submarines that
Taiwan has requested, Chou added.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he continued, if the two sides maintain a
hostile attitude, the United States might decide to sell Taiwan "just
about any weapon."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition New Party legislator Elmer Fung said at a
legislative session that the government should quickly convene a
national security meeting because this incident cannot be treated
carelessly.</P>
      <P>KMT legislator Chao Erh-chung added his warning that Taiwan
should be vigilant in monitoring the upcoming Washington-Beijing
negotiation process to prevent being "sold out" without its
knowledge.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
Tuesday called for the adoption of a "soft approach" toward Beijing
and urged mainland China to take care of its people rather than
deploying missiles aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan is a small island, but that "we are not afraid
while confronting mainland China's threats because of our 'soft
national strength' -- the respect for human rights, democracy, peace,
love and high technology."</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan has always been a peace-loving country and
has never been an "invader" or posed any threat to mainland China, Lu
said that many Taiwan people now reside in the mainland for study,
business and travel purposes, and that it is indeed unnecessary for
Beijing to deploy hundreds of missiles along its coasts targeting
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The vice president made the remarks while receiving a 25-member
1delegation of the Association of World Citizens (AWC), which has
been celebrating its 11th World Citizen Congress in Taipei over the
past five days.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan as "a distant relative and a close friend" of
mainland China, Liu said the island has transformed itself into a
diversified and democratic nation through a lengthy process. She
asked the AWC delegates to relay Taiwan's peaceful message to the
mainland and push it to stop aiming its missiles at Taiwan in order
to promote peaceful co-existence between the two sides.</P>

South China Sea between a U.S. spy plane and a mainland Chinese

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC JOBLESS RATE MORE THAN DOUBLE OFFICIAL FIGURE AT 8.4%: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The real domestic jobless rate is 8.4
percent, more than double the official figure of 3.73 percent,
according to a recent survey.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Yi-chiao of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) and the magazine Biznews unveiled the results of the latest
survey in a press conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted March 21-23, with 1,074 effective
samples gathered from 1,931 people aged 20-64. The poll's carries a
margin of error of three percent.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 12.4 percent of the respondents said
they are willing to work overseas, and among them, nearly 70 percent
chose mainland China as their most desired destination.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) said recently that domestic unemployment had increased to a
record high of 3.73 percent in February, with the some 364,000
jobless workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But as the DGBAS had mainly targeted farmers, workers hired by
the government, employers, and self-employed workers for its survey,
some analysts say that its unemployment figure may be an
underestimation.</P>
      <P>The new survey excluded military personnel, civil servants,
teachers, farmers, employers, housewives and retirees -- or those who
are considered low-risk jobless groups -- and found that the jobless
rate for people who have the ability to work but have been unable to
find jobs for more than six months has reached 8.4 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that most of the jobless either are more
than 50 years of age, have middle high school educations, or are male
laborers from places other than northern Taiwan. This is seen as an
indication of a structural transformation of Taiwan's industries.</P>
      <P>The survey also found the less education one has, the higher
one's chances of being unemployed. Among the jobless, males
outnumbered females by 65.3 percent to 34.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The jobless situation is more serious in central and southern
Taiwan than in the northern region, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>It also found that the households of 43 percent of the jobless
are already in financial dire straits.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 12.4 percent of respondents do not rule out
working overseas, and nearly 70 percent chose the mainland as their

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION DOWN IN MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid a continuously sluggish economy at
home and overseas, Taiwan's manufacturing production in March was
down 7.38 percent from the same time last year, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-chung, director general of the MOEA's Statistics
Department, said that manufacturing output in March was up 10.97
percent from the previous month, showing that the economy may be
turning around, but whether or not it has bottomed out remains to be
seen.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the economic chart this year will not resemble a
"V," but rather a "U." He said he will have to continue to watch
export orders and the production of the manufacturing sector before
predicting when the economy will begin to rebound.</P>
      <P>He attributed the drop in manufacturing to this year's sluggish
economy. In addition, the annual increase in manufacturing production
last year was in the double digits, presenting a higher basis for
comparison, he said.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Chang said that as Taiwan relies a lot on the U.S.
market, which is obviously slowing, there is no reason for optimism
from that market. But he said that as 50 percent of Taiwan's exports
now are taken by the Asian market, the mainland economy continues to
grow, and trade with Hong Kong is still brisk, the prospect of an
economic rebound here is more likely than in the United States.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the second quarter could not be worse than the
first quarter in Taiwan, and that an economic rebound would occur in
the third or fourth quarter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VISITING TAIWAN LAWMAKERS TO MEET WITH BEIJING'S VICE PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  April  3  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of visiting legislators from
Taiwan's People First Party is slated to meet with Beijing's Vice
Premier Qian Qichen Tuesday afternoon after calling on officials of
the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
and Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.</P>
      <P>The PFP lawmakers' Beijing trip has been full of twists and
turns. At first, the group's number was reduced from 16 to 6 after
one of its female members was hospitalized after being beaten by
another lawmaker in the Legislative Yuan, and then the delegation's
itinerary was subject to further changes. Even the schedule of the
Qian meeting, which will be the culmination of their trip, was
changed from Tuesday morning to Tuesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>The visiting group is trying to woo Beijing's support for its
plan to define direct shipping links between the two sides as a
special shipping route rather than an international shipping lane, as
the Taiwan administration prefers, or internal links, as Beijing has
advocated. However, they have found their proposal a hard sell in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the PFP lawmakers met with a group of Taiwan
businessmen operating in Beijing to listen to their problems.</P>
      <P>The businessmen said they appreciated the PFP's efforts to help
open direct transportation links between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait and complained about the education problems facing their
children because Taiwan does not accredit mainland Chinese schools.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Sung-pan, who is heading the delegation, promised
to refer their problems to Taipei's Mainland Affairs Council.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force has
successfully test-fired an anti-ship AGM-848 Harpoon missile from its
F-16 jet fighter, the Air Force General Headquarters (AFGH) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to AFGH officials, the Air Force No. 6821 F-16 jet
fighter test-fired the Harpoon missile Tuesday in an air force-navy
combined drill under the ongoing Hankuang No. 17 military exercise in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It was the first time in the world that an air-launched Harpoon
missile has been successfully fired from an F-16 fighter jet, Air
Force officers said.</P>
      <P>"The AGM-848 Harpoon missile fired from F-16 fighter accurately
hit the target -- a decommissioned destroyer -- off the Chiupeng bay
in the southern Taiwan county of Pingtung," said an AFGH official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Military sources said the Air Force 401 Wing conducted a
combined maritime drill with the Navy's Hsiungfeng II
missile-equipped Kangting-class (originally named Lafayette-class)
frigates off the Chiupeng bay Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In the drill, the sources said, the participating air force and
navy personnel practiced strategies and skills for fighting mainland
China's Russian-made Sovremennyy-class destroyers, including the
test-firing of an air-launched, anti-ship Harpoon missile.</P>
      <P>The ROC armed forces began their annual combined services
training exercise, codenamed "Hankuang No. 17," at the beginning
of April. The massive-scale military exercise will be held in two
stages. One stage features live-fire drills while the other will
focus on cyberwar games.</P>
      <P>Military sources said attacks by mainland Chinese M-class
missiles will be scenarios to be presented in the cyberwar games and
that the civil defense system will be tested.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first military cyberwar unit, launched in January,
makes its debut in the current Hankuang exercise.</P>

      <P>Former U.S. ambassador to Beijing James
Lilley said Tuesday that the Bush administration should decide what
weapons to sell Taiwan based on the latter's self-defense needs and
not on considerations related to issue of the U.S. surveillance plane
and crew being held by mainland China.</P>
      <P>He told Voice of America radio station that the United States and
Communist China have an opportunity to prevent the current crisis
from derailing bilateral relations. If the two sides can handle the
surveillance plane issue discreetly and as quickly as possible, they
can move on to dealing with normal bilateral business.</P>
      <P>The decision on arms sales to Taiwan will, "of course, be
influenced if (the Communist Chinese) put these 24 people on trial,
if they make an obvious effort to ransack the airplane, etc.," the
former U.S. representative to Taipei said.</P>
      <P>If this were to occur, Lilley pointed out, the United States
might feel compelled to sell higher quality weapons to Taiwan. But he
added that he is convinced that Washington and Beijing can work

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIALS OF FORMER KMT GOV'T BASHED FOR SPATE OF VISITS TO MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Democratic Progressive Party legislator
gave officials of the former Kuomintang administration a bashing
Wednesday for their roles in whipping up a new wave of "mainland
fever" in Taiwan's business and trade sectors, which he said has led
to a flight of Taiwan capital to mainland China in recent years.</P>
      <P>In a Legislative Yuan interpellation session, Legislator Chiu
Chui-chen ridiculed the spate of visits to mainland China in recent
months by ranking officials of the former KMT administration,
questioning the propriety of the large number of visits and asking
Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi how he views the situation.</P>
      <P>Saying that he has no views concerning Chiu's accusation, Lin
reiterated the stance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) that
while the government is readjusting Taiwan's "go slow" policy toward
mainland China, it is at the same time strenuously working out coping
measures to regulate mainland-bound Taiwan investments.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council, Taiwan's top governmental agency
responsible for formulating mainland China policy, is currently in
charge of the task, and the MOEA and the Ministry of Finance are
offering support, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiu bashed the former officials, including
Presidential Secretary-General John Chang, Transportation and
Communications Minister Liu Chao-shuan, Council for Economic Planning
and Development Chairman P.K. Chiang, Economic Affairs Minister Wang
Chih-kang and Finance Minister Paul Chiu, for visiting mainland China
one after another in recent months and creating a new wave of "China
fever" in Taiwan's business and trade sectors.</P>
      <P>Chiu's accusation, however, drew protests from KMT Legislator
Liao Wan-ju, who demanded that Chiu not mislead the general public by
making biased allegations and accusations during legislative
sessions.</P>
      <P>Liao, in turn, asked Minister Lin whether he has visited mainland
China and whether he is for or against Republic of China officials
visiting mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lin replied that he has visited mainland China several times and
that he personally favors ROC officials visiting the mainland to gain
a better understanding of it's systems, administration proficiency
and related policies on attracting foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin, in response to questions raised by other
legislators about the upcoming APEC ministerial-level meeting to be
held in Shanghai, said it is hoped that ROC officials will be able to
discuss matters concerning investment guarantee agreements between
Taiwan and mainland China with their Beijing counterparts during the
APEC meetings to be held in June.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday
the Republic of China sincerely hopes that the United States and
mainland China can resolve their military aircraft collision incident
peacefully, rationally and properly.</P>
      <P>"For the sake of maintaining peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region, we are hopeful that Washington and Beijing
can quickly and properly resolve the issue regarding a recent midair
collision between a U.S. surveillance plane and a mainland fighter
in line with the international regulations and practices," Chang
said during a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>It was also the first time that the ROC premier has spoken on
the issue since the collision in the South China Sea forced the U.S.
plane to make an emergency landing on mainland China's Hainan island
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang further expressed his hopes that the United States
continues honoring its commitment to furnishing Taiwan with adequate
defensive weapons in accrdance with the provisions of the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA) and Taiwan's practical defense needs. The TRA is
the U.S. law that regulates relations with Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang directed all relevant government agencies to
keep high alert on whether mainland China would take advantage of
this incident to force the United States to compromise on its stances
or make any concessions at the ROC's expense.</P>
      <P>"All relevant government agencies should closely monitor the
developments in the incident and keep abreast of the latest
information," the premier urged, adding that trelevant agencies
should hammer out countermeasures to cope with possible

(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Executive Yuan on
Wednesday passed a proposal put forth by the ROC Ministry of Foreign
Affairs to extend a medical cooperation agreement with Senegal for an
extra three years.</P>
      <P>The ROC signed a five-year medical cooperation agreement with
Senegal in 1996, promising US$700,000 in financial support to the
African country each year during that period, according to the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The agreement, which already expired Jan. 2, 2001, helped Senegal
construct more medical facilities, purchase higher quality medicine,
send domestic medical staff abroad for higher education, and hire
more doctors and caregivers.</P>
      <P>Through an exchange of diplomatic notes between the ROC Embassy
and the Senegalese Foreign Ministry in Dakar, Senegal's capital, the
two countries extended the cooperation agreement for an additional
three years, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao on Wednesday
honored Senegal Ambassador to the ROC Ahmed Tijane Kane with a medal
in recognition of his contributions toward relations between the two
countries. Tien presided over the ceremony which was attended by many
officials and foreign ambassadors.</P>
      <P>Kane, who has been Senegal's ambassador to the ROC since 1998,
had also served as the ambassador to many different countries,
including mainland China, South Korea, Thailand, and Australia, prior
to assuming his present post.</P>

discounted reports Wednesday that mainland Chinese forces have been
on first-level combat alert since Sunday, when a U.S. surveillance
plane made an emergency landing on Hainan island after a collision

      <P>Huang made the remarks in comments on reports by several daily

    <HEADLINE>ROC WARY OF POSSIBLE IMPACT OF COLLISION INCIDENT ON WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is warily watching
whether the collision of a U.S. surveillance aircraft and a mainland
Chinese fighter jet will affect Beijing's and Taipei's admission to
the World Trade Organization (WTO), a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen made the
remarks during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Economic and
Energy Affairs Committee on the ROC's WTO entry and protection of
Taiwanese investments on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Chou Hsi-wei asked
Tsai at the meeting whether the forced landing of a U.S. spy plane on
mainland China's Hainan Island after colliding with a mainland
fighter over the South China Sea Sunday will delay Beijing's
negotiations for its WTO accession terms and consequently hinder
Taiwan's WTO entry.</P>
      <P>According to a tacit understanding among WTO members, Taiwan and
mainland China should be admitted to the organization simultaneously.
Although Taiwan has long finalized all negotiations over entry terms,
it has to wait for the mainland to complete its WTO trade concession
talks and formalities.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chou's question, Tsai said relevant ROC government
agencies are still evaluating the possible repercussions of Sunday's
collision and that it would be premature to make any judgment at
present.</P>
      <P>"Whether the incident will affect our WTO accession will depend
on the developments in the U.S.-mainland China negotiations over
relevant matters," Tsai explained.</P>
      <P>The ROC's top mainland policy planner further said that
information from mainland China shows that the Beijing authorities do
not want to see further ramifications of the incident because they
have many internal issues on hand and their main work agenda for 2001
focuses on economic and domestic reforms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW TECO REP STRESSES CANADA AND TAIWAN'S COMMON VALUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April 3 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thomas Tung-pi Chen, new representative of
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada, stressed Tuesday
that Canada and Taiwan share the common values of freedom, democracy
and human rights.</P>
      <P>He told hundreds of Canadian guests and Chinese and Taiwanese
community leaders that both countries have common concerns over peace
and security in the Asia-Pacific region and have a common interest in
promoting their bilateral trade and investment, Chen said.</P>
      <P>During a reception welcoming Chen and his wife to Ottawa, the
former scholar and lawyer noted that two-way trade between Canada and
Taiwan now exceeds C$6 billion (about US$3.8 billion) a year, adding
that more than 150,000 people from Taiwan visit Canada and tens of
thousands of Taiwan immigrants bring billions of dollars into Canada
each year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Canada's eighth largest trading partner, he said,
emphasizing the central role his office will play in promoting
bilateral relations between Canada and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that both Taiwan and Canada are his home countries,
noting that he was born and raised and received his education up
until university in Taiwan and later earned his master's and doctoral
degrees in the U.S. before coming to Canada to launch his
professional career. He retired from Queen's University, Ontario, and
remains a professor emeritus of the prestigious Canadian university.</P>
      <P>Chen urged Canadian and overseas Chinese and Taiwanese friends to
help him promote bilateral relations between Canada and Taiwan. Among
those welcoming him were three members of Canada's Parliament who had
graduated from Queen's University Law School, including his one-time
student and partner Derek Lee of the Liberal Party.</P>
      <P>Dozens of members of the House of Commons and the Senate, along
with leaders from think tanks, business institutions and local
universities, and members of the diplomatic corps, applauded when he
said his appointment as Taiwan's top representative in Canada was due
to Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>John McKay, chair of the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship
Association, lauded Taiwan's democratization, calling last year's
first-ever peaceful change of government in China's or Taiwan's
3,000-year history as an "enormous accomplishment" that his
association is very proud of.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's example demonstrates that the
transformation of an Asian country from a single-party to multi-party
government "can be done."</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 100 MEMBERS OF U.S. CONGRESS CALL FOR AEGIS SALE TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  3  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 100 members of Congress on
Tuesday called on the Bush administration to support the sale of
destroyers equipped with the advanced Aegis combat system to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In two similar letters sent to President George W. Bush, 83 House
members and 20 senators said: "We strongly support and recommend that
your administration recognize the legitimate need for Taiwan to
acquire the Arleigh Burke Aegis destroyers".</P>
      <P>The letters were sent at a critical juncture in U.S. relations
with mainland China, although the timing is coincidental. The drafts
have been circulated on Capitol Hill in the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Secretary of State Colin Powell said he did not think
the current standoff with Beijing over the fate of a U.S.
surveillance plane and its crew should be linked to considerations of
arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The arms sales question, he told reporters, is examined "in the
context of our obligations to Taiwan under the policies we followed
with respect to Taiwan and their defensive needs."</P>
      <P>"So I would like to keep the two issues separate," Powell added.</P>
      <P>However, some members of Congress and their aides said they
believe that Beijing's handling of the spy plane incident will have
an impact on the arms sales debate.</P>
      <P>"This is a serious event in Sino-American relations and may be a
very important negative event in our relationship," said Rep. Doug
Bereuter (R-Neb.), a member the House Select Committee on
Intelligence and former chairman of the House Subcommittee on Asia
and the Pacific.</P>
      <P>"The requested sale of Aegis-class destroyers becomes more
likely" as Beijing continues to hold the 24-member crew of the U.S.
SP-3 surveillance plane, he said.</P>
      <P>Beijing has so far refused a repeated U.S. demand for the release
of the crew members and the aircraft after the plane collided with a
Chinese fighter jet and made an emergency landing on the island of
Hainan on April 1.</P>
      <P>The letters were drafted by Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.),
Taiwan-born Rep. David Wu (D-Ore), and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC).</P>
      <P>Beijing has warned the United States not to approve the sale and
has indicated that any such transfer would cause "serious problems"
for the bilateral relationship. The administration is expected to
make a decision later this month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is believed to have asked to purchase four Aegis-class
destroyers from the United States at an estimated cost of around $1
billion each.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian was urged
Wednesday by former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih
Ming-teh to "move fast" to allow parity between his powers and his
ability.</P>
      <P>The outspoken politician urged Chen not to wait until the
year-end elections but accelerate his efforts to find a balance
between his ability and his power as president "before it's too
late."</P>
      <P>Shih, currently an independent legislator, said that if Chen were
wise and shrewd enough, he should have taken advantage of a favorable
situation upon his election victory last March to reshape the
Republic of China's political landscape by forming a coalition
government.</P>
      <P>Shih lamented that the situation in Taiwan since Chen was sworn
in as the new ROC president last May shows that he lacks wisdom and
judgment as a national leader, resulting in the continual defeat that
his administration now faces.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan is now mired in a crisis of "no ideals and
no passion," a situation resulting from the fact that no one is
playing his or her own role correctly.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local radio channel, Shih said that in
today's Taiwan, the ruling party is not acting like a ruling party,
while the opposition parties are not doing an efficient job as a
balancing force. "Even now, we have yet to see the president acting
like a president," Shih noted.</P>

      <P>Taiwan workers in the industrial and
service sectors earned an average annual income of NT$502,488 in
2000, 3.5 times that of the average NT$147,390 for mainland Chinese
workers, according to the results of a recent survey.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, an increasing number of ranking Taiwan
officials in mainland-based Taiwan-funded companies are being
replaced by their mainland Chinese counterparts, according to the
survey jointly carried out by the Taiwan-based ctcareer.com and the
mainland-based chinahr.com.</P>
      <P>However, demand for qualified business management personnel is
still high in mainland China, as a result of an insufficient supply
of locally trained talent, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Amid rising unemployment in Taiwan, mainland China has become the
major outlet for Taiwan jobless people to seek a new lease of life.
Average incomes in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Guangzhou are the three
highest compared with other major cities in the mainland.</P>
      <P>In terms of occupations, business management experts, stock
analysts, telecommunications engineers and salesmen are the best paid
professionals in mainland China, with an average annual income of
between NT$197,280 and NT$168,000, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, business management personnel are also the top salary
earners, with an average annual income of NT$698,076.
Telecommunications engineers, financial analysts and accountants,
salesmen, and computer researchers and developers followed, with an
annual average incomes ranging from NT$638,000 to NT$566,000.</P>
      <P>The survey also discovered that the average personal income for
male workers in mainland China is 1.14 times that of their female
co-workers, while the gap in Taiwan is 1.3 times, with the
manufacturing sector posting the largest imbalance of 1.5 times.</P>
      <P>According to the website chinahr.com, mainland Chinese female

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Master Cheng Yen, founder of the Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, the largest charity
organization in Taiwan, urged the media Wednesday to take on a more
responsible mission and report on the "truth" and the "beauty" of
society.</P>
      <P>Master Cheng Yen made the appeal in a forum sponsored by the
Central News Agency at the Taipei branch of the foundation.</P>
      <P>CNA President Bill Wang, presiding over the forum, said that
several incidents recently have shown "worrisome" phenomena in
Taiwan's society, which some observers have attributed to an
overabundance of "negative" news and the media's relentless or
meticulous reporting on them.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope of striking a balance between the people's
right to know and the interest of society, as well as more reports on
the positive side of society.</P>
      <P>National Chengchi University Professor Hsu Chia-shih and media
leaders from various television, newspaper and broadcasting companies
also attended the forum.</P>
      <P>Master Cheng Yen urged everyone to "speak good words, do good
deeds, walk a good path, and think with a good will," uniting
together to push for society's "goodness."</P>
      <P>She also said as the society relies a lot on the media, the media
should report on the "truth" and "beauty" of society. She noted
that there are many good people in society, so the media would have
ample sources for its reporting.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that the seed of love could be sown in the
hearts of the people, citing the example of Tzu Chi members, who are
all over the world, both responding to the natural disasters in India
and El Salvador, and also the recent car accident involving Taiwanese
students in the U.S. state of Texas.</P>
      <P>She said that Tzu Chi members do good deeds voluntarily, and if
there is a seed of love in the heart of everyone, it will grow and
flourish and become an indomitable power. She said the sun in the Tzu
Chi world is never setting.</P>
      <P>Master Cheng Yen said that the media has its mission, just like
Tzu Chi, and news reports should be "true" and display "beauty,"
which she said would lead others to the path of "goodness."</P>
      <P>Several participants in the forum also echoed her views, saying
that the media needs spiritual reform.</P>
      <P>Liao Chun-chieh, vice president of Broadcasting Corporation of
China, said that the media should take on the responsibility of
educating the people, and journalists should report on the many
touching stories in society.</P>
      <P>Lin Chang-sung, vice president of China Television Company, also
said that though Taiwan media has made great strides over the past
years, progress has not been enough. Lin added that many media
organizations have taken to reporting "porno news," adding that
self-discipline among the media is an urgent task.</P>
      <P>Hu Wang-ling of Formosa Television said that the media should try
to report news in a professional way, showing the truth in various

Agriculture Research Institute, said that his team's cooperative
research into a particular variety of the orchid family has shown
that extracts of Anoectochilus formosanus Hay. -- often taken in the
form of a medicinal tea -- exhibit antioxidant, anti-fungal,
anti-bacterial and anti-tumor characteristics.</P>
      <P>He added that the same herbal extract is also able to improve
diabetic conditions, lower blood sugar levels, prevent
atherosclarosis and osteoporosis, and stimulate brain cell growth so
as to prevent memory loss.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that another medicinal plant, the protein-rich Chinese
yam, is lethal to tumor cells, can prevent the growth of breast
cancer cells, and is able to strengthen the body's immune system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Jung-tsan, director of National Yang Ming
University's Graduate Institute of Pharmacognosy Sciences, presented
the results of his research into a particular species of dendrobium,
another member of the orchid family.</P>
      <P>Wu said that his research proved extracts of the species can
stimulate liver cell growth and retinal epithelial cell growth,
thereby leading to improved eyesight.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD MEETS WITH GRANDDAUGHTER OF ROC FOUNDER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan met with Dr.
Sun Shui-feng, granddaughter of Republic of China founder Dr. Sun
Yat-sen, to discuss the "Three Principles of the People" Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Upon meeting Lien, Sun immediately gave him a memorial book about
her grandfather. The KMT head presented her in kind with a whole set
of "Sun Wen's Theories" in a gesture to show the importance the KMT
attaches to her grandfather.</P>
      <P>Lien also stressed that when the "Three Principles of the People"
-- the centerpiece of the "Sun Wen Theories" -- could be openly
talked about in mainland China, it would be the right time for the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait to unite.</P>
      <P>Asked about her feelings about a KMT advertisement featuring her
grandfather prior to her meeting with Lien, Sun particularly praised
one phrase in the advertisement and said that it is time for the
107-year-old political party to stand up on its feet and strive to
recover from its past errors and defeats.</P>
      <P>"Repentance will bring about incredible strength," she said.</P>
      <P>The KMT became Taiwan's leading opposition party after losing the
presidential race in March last year. Lien finished a distant third
to the present President Chen Shui-bian and former Taiwan Governor
James Soong.</P>
      <P>Sun also paid a visit to the Legislative Yuan and called on
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng. Sun's father -- Sun Fo -- served as the first
legislative speaker after the KMT-led government moved to Taiwan from
mainland China in 1949 at the end of a civil war against the Chinese
Communists.</P>
      <P>In that meeting, Sun lamented that the "Three Principles of the
People" are no longer taught in Taiwanese schools and colleges. Wang
gave her his personal appraisal of the national founder's political
thoughts and told her that students in local colleges can still take
optional courses in "Three Principles of the People."</P>
      <P>Sun, who returned to Taiwan late last month for a visit, now
resides in Hawaii.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT NOT TO PRESIDE OVER ANNUAL HANKUANG MILITARY DRILLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will not preside
over an upcoming tri-service military anti-landing exercise as part
of the ongoing Hankuang No. 17 military drills in consideration of
the sensitive times, military sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the military official, Chen was originally slated to
oversee the exercise to be held in southern Taiwan April 20.</P>
      <P>However, the official added that Chen and the General Staff
Headquarters decided against the plan as a precaution against
inadvertently escalating tensions in the Taiwan Strait, particularly
in the wake of the mid-air collision of a U.S. surveillance plane and
a mainland Chinese jet fighter, which has served to escalate tensions
in the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chen Cheng-hsiang will preside over
the drill instead.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of National Defense, this year's annual
Hankuang exercises, which began last month with war game simulations
and air superiority drills, are classified as a comprehensive combat
readiness appraisal of the military's streamlining and modernization.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an army general told reporters that live-fire testing
will be conducted for the military's newly acquired vehicle-mounted
Avenger and lightweight Dual Mount Stinger air-defense missiles at a
military base in southern Taiwan as part of the Hankuang exercises.</P>
      <P>U.S. Hawk missiles and locally produced Tien Kung missiles will
also be fired to test the island's air defense capabilities, the
general said, adding that the military's Patriot anti-missile systems
will be tested separately.</P>
      <P>According to air force officials, an air force F-16 jet fighter
successfully test-fired a sea-skimming anti-ship Harpoon missile
Tuesday in a combined drill with the navy as part of the Hankuang
exercises.</P>

      <P>A spokesman for the state-run Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) announced Wednesday that the firm will cut its
prices by an average 2.57 percent, effective Thursday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the lower prices are in response to a fall in
international crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>He said that despite the fact that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reduced its daily production by one
million barrels, there has been no corresponding increase in
international oil prices, mainly due to the decrease in demand for
heating oil with the coming of spring.</P>
      <P>The new CPC prices are as follows:</P>
      <P>-- 95 octane unleaded gasoline, NT$20 (US$0.61) per liter;</P>
      <P>-- 92 octane unleaded gasoline, NT$18.9 per liter;</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF OFFICIAL PLAYS DOWN   QIAN'S   IDEA   OF   DIRECT   LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing Vice Premier Qian Qichen's proposal
to form direct transportation links between Taiwan and mainland China
was dismissed as "not constructive" by a Taiwan official Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shi Hwei-yow, secretary-general of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation, made the remarks in response to Qian's suggestion that
bilateral transportation links between the two sides be negotiated
through private carriers interested in operating the shipping links.
Shi said Qian's suggestion is just a ploy to deny Taiwan the parity
it deserves.</P>
      <P>Establishing transportation links, including direct flights and
maritime shipping, is not "children's play," Shi said, adding that it
should be negotiated in public rather than in secret and by
authorized government agencies rather than private firms.</P>
      <P>Officials of private firms, without a mandate from the
government, could not conclude accords that would bind other people,
let alone the authorities, Shi said.</P>
      <P>He dismissed Qian's idea as nothing but part of Beijing's
attempts to isolate the administration of the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) by courting Taiwan's opposition parties.</P>
      <P>It only indicates Beijing's reluctance to resume a dialogue with
Taiwan, let alone establish contacts with the DPP administration, Shi
said.</P>
      <P>Shi made the comment after Qian reportedly told a group of Taiwan
opposition legislators visiting Beijing Tuesday that if Taiwan is
reluctant to commit to the "one China" principle, the island can
conduct negotiations with Beijing on direct bilateral links through
private firms.</P>
      <P>In that way, Qian was quoted as saying, the two sides could open
shipping links without defining them as either domestic or
international.</P>
      <P>The dispute blocking the establishment of the direct links stems
from Beijing's insistence that Taiwan is a part of China and that the
links should be defined as internal, a claim unacceptable to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing has shut down all channels of communications with Taiwan
authorities ever since former President Lee Teng-hui characterized
the island's ties with mainland China as a "special state-to-state"
relationship in July 1999.</P>
      <P>The mainland has kept up its political boycott of the
administration of Lee's successor, President Chen Shui-bian, claiming
that he has backed away from the "one China" principle. According to
Beijing, both sides committed to that principle in 1992.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 50 private cram schools in
Taoyuan have reportedly become the targets of extortionists since two
days ago, when a man threw a Molotov cocktail into a Taoyuan
arithmetic school, killing two and wounding another 19.</P>
      <P>Police received complaints from several supplementary school
operators Wednesday that about 50 such educational centers in Taoyuan
have received anonymous letters demanding payment of NT$50,000 (about
US$1,538) to avoid being attacked by petrol bombs similar to the one
that was thrown at Chiayin Mental Arithmetic School on Monday.</P>
      <P>The letters instructed recipients to put the cash into specified
bank accounts before April 10, or "someone will come forward to make
trouble" -- meaning similar arson attacks.</P>
      <P>The letter also demands NT$10,000 for each day delay in payment
following April 10.</P>
      <P>Police said they are working with financial institutions in an

      <P>The National Council on Physical Fitness

sponsorship of the 2007 Universiade, an international multi-sport
collegiate event that takes place every two years.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan sought the sponsorship of this year's games but
failed largely due to mainland Chinese intervention. Beijing abruptly
applied for and won the rights to sponsor the games, and will be
holding the 21st Universiade from Aug. 22 to Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>The NCPFS instructed the Chinese Taipei University Sports

next January.</P>
      <P>According to the Brussels-based International Sports Federation,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>James Soong, chairman of the opposition
People First Party (PFP), said Wednesday that he hopes he was the
"last victim of political prosecution and suppression."</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks after the Taiwan Prosecutors'
 Office turned over new evidence of a financial deal
involving Soong -- commonly known here as "The Chung Hsing Bills
Finance Corp. scandal" -- to the Taipei Prosecutors' Office for
further investigation.</P>
      <P>Soong said that as far as he knows, the Taiwan Prosecutors'
Office did not ask for a renewed probe into the case, but simply
acted on the report of Chuang Po-lin, who was commissioned by the
opposition Kuomintang to press the embezzlement charges against Soong
in the first place.</P>
      <P>Soong said he still remembers vividly the embezzlement charges
against him during the heat of presidential campaign in early 2000.
He said that they cost him the presidency because he was far ahead of
other candidates before the charges came to light.</P>
      <P>Soong said the case is a naked political smear campaign and added
that the government is using a national machine to violate his human
rights.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Prosecutors Office of the Taipei District Court
had dropped the charges, and said that Taiwan Prosecutors'
Office confirmed Tuesday that it had closed the case
because the KMT -- which originally pressed the charges -- decided
against pursuing them.</P>
      <P>But the decision to turn the case over to the district court
after Chuang's so-called "fresh incidence" was an "unnecessary
appendix," Soong said.</P>
      <P>He said that he was willing to look forward, hoping that he will
be the "last person" to undergo political prosecution and
suppression.</P>
      <P>Soong said that the district court has vindicated his innocence,
but it will be hard for it to give back justice because the
presidential election can not be held again. He added that many have
said the scandal was the main cause of his loss in the presidential
campaign.</P>
      <P>The case arose from a huge amount of cash stashed in a secret
bank account controlled by Soong. When the hidden bank account came
to light during the peak of the presidential election, Soong, who ran
in the race as an independent, claimed the funds were put in his
charge by then-KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui to finance secret political
operations.</P>
      <P>Soong said he took charge of the funds while serving as the KMT
secretary-general but had no chance to return them to Lee after the
two fell out over Soong's insistence on joining the race for the
presidency.</P>
      <P>But Lee angrily denied this, denouncing it as "nonsense" and the
KMT filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office against Soong for
alleged embezzlement.</P>
      <P>Soong claimed that he was framed by the KMT and called the
complaint a smear campaign against him. He offered to give NT$248
million (US$US$7.51 million) back to the KMT and place it with the
courts in escrow.</P>

      <P>The collision of U.S. and mainland Chinese
aircraft over the South China Sea might affect ties between those two
countries but will have no bearing on Washington's arms sales to
Taiwan, said a former Taiwan representative to Washington Wednesday.</P>
      <P>However, Stephen Chen cautioned that if the dispute between
Beijing and Washington is not resolved rapidly but instead drags on
and deepens, it might have a negative impact on Taiwan's ties with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The former diplomat, who now serves as a researcher at a
Kuomintang think tank, cited as an example Washington's 1999
declaration of displeasure with then-Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's
surprise claim for Taiwan statehood in his engagement with Beijing,
which did not influence the U.S. decision on arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Similarly, Chen said he believes the friction between Beijing and
Washington over the collision between a mainland fighter jet and a
U.S. reconnaissance plane will not impact Washington's pending
decision on arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Branding the collision as an accident, Chen predicted that
Beijing would not gain much from it in spite of Beijing's attempts to
milk the issue for all its worth. He said there is no question of the
issue escalating into war.</P>
      <P>He said it is his belief that Washington will dispatch an envoy
to Beijing to calm mainland Chinese outrage over the incident and
resolve the dispute.</P>
      <P>He urged the Taiwan authorities to keep a close eye on the
dispute but to stay away from it and refrain from making any comment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOONG URGES PFP LAWMAKERS VISITING M'LAND NOT TO BE USED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tianjin,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Fang Hsu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of legislators from Taiwan's
opposition People First Party (PFP) who are currently on a visit to
mainland China were urged by PFP Chairman James Soong to be "careful"
of not being used by Beijing regarding certain cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>In a telephone conversation with Soong, who is in Taipei, PFP
Legislator Shen Chih-huei said Beijing has now softened its stance on
the issue of direct links with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen, in
a meeting with visiting PFP lawmakers in Beijing Tuesday, said that
the "one China" term could be omitted from all bilateral
transportation documents if Taiwan feels uncomfortable about it.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan wants to sidestep the thorny issue of `one China', the
island should take its cue from the aviation negotiations between
Taiwan and Hong Kong in 1996 and conduct talks with Beijing through
private channels," Qian was quoted as having said.</P>
      <P>"Government officials could still take part in the talks as
executives of the private firms involved," Qian said.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Liu Sung-fan, head of the visiting Taiwan group,
said afterward that Qian's statement indicated a softening of
Beijing's previous position that the "one China" principle must be a
prerequisite to any talks on transportation links and that
transportation between the two sides is a Chinese internal affair.</P>
      <P>Commenting on this, PFP Chairman Soong reminded Shen and Liu and
other PFP lawmakers, who proceeded to Tianjin from Beijing Wednesday,
to be careful of not being used by Qian and other mainland Chinese
authorities, at least not on the "one China" issue.</P>
      <P>Soong told Shen over the phone that while Beijing seemed to be
"softening" its stance on the "one China" issue over talks with the
Taiwan legislators, Beijing's official Xinhua News Agency continued
to stress in its Tuesday night reports that matters concerning the
opening of direct "three links" across the Taiwan Strait are
"internal affairs."</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, the PFP legislators visited the harbor in Tianjin,
one of the biggest harbor cities in mainland China. They also visited
an industrial processing zone located in the nearby Tanggu Port
District and a manufacturing plant of the Dingxin Group, a Taiwan
enterprise which operates one of the largest instant noodle
businesses throughout mainland China.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers are scheduled to proceed to Xian Thursday for a
one-day visit before returning to Taiwan Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRUG STORES MUST APPLY TO SELL RU486: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) stressed
Thursday that RU486, an abortion pill, will only be sold in
drugstores that have first applied to do so and have received
approval.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said that in order to prevent the abuse of RU486,
the DOH's National Bureau of Controlled Drugs has adopted the measure
that calls for all operators and medical institutions that
manufacture, import, export, sell or purchase RU486 to apply and get
approval on a batch-by-batch basis.</P>
      <P>Those who have received approval to sell RU486 will have to give
a list of their selling conditions to local health authorities, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>As the selling of RU486 via the Internet has become rampant,
with sellers using their mobile phones to sell the pills, the
National Bureau of Controlled Drugs said it will occasionally monitor
the Internet and report to police for help in investigating any
irregularities. Telecommunication operators will also be asked to
terminate services to violators.</P>

      <P>The White House made it clear Wednesday

Taiwan will not be affected by the current Washington-Beijing
standoff over the American surveillance plane and crew being held on

in any way be used as a bargaining chip in the current standoff,
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told a routine press briefing
that "the ultimate decision the president makes will be based on his
review of the defense needs of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The spokesman was also asked whether there was any indication
during the recent visit to the United States by mainland Chinese Vice

    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs kept mum
Thursday on reports of former President Lee Teng-hui's sounding out
the possibility of obtaining an entry visa from the Japanese
government.</P>
      <P>Japanese foreign affairs officials declined to make further
comment on the possibility of Lee's visit to Japan, only saying that
Japan's stance at present is "a blank sheet" -- meaning it has no
stance, Japanese media reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>On Lee's possible application for a visit to Japan, mainland
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan on Wednesday reiterated
Beijing's consistent opposition to such a visit during a talk with
visiting Japanese Justice Minister Masahiko Komura in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Nihon Keizai Shinbum reported Wednesday that Lee is scheduled
to visit the United States at the end of April and plans to visit
Japan on his way home in May.</P>
      <P>The Japanese daily said that Lee's main purpose in making the
trip to Japan is to have his heart checked after an operation last
year. The Japanese government's reaction will become the focus of the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE MIGRANT WORKERS FEEL THE PINCH IN MAINLAND CHINA (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>They seem to belong to both sides, but in
fact, they belong to neither. While working in mainland China, they
often miss their families in Taiwan. When they are in Taiwan, they
miss their careers on the mainland. The question they are most likely
to encounter on either side -- "when will you return?" -- sums up the
plight of Taiwanese migrant workers on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The so-called Taiwanese migrants are mainly management staff
working in Taiwan-funded companies in mainland China. The driving
forces that lure Taiwanese executives to move across the Taiwan
Strait lie in their desire to earn more money, seek a major career
breakthrough, or even the opportunity to launch their own business
ventures someday.</P>
      <P>However, in reality, it's no easy thing to be a Taiwanese worker
in mainland China. As the country transforms into a world-class
manufacturing base with a vast potential market, it has attracted not
only capital but also talent from around the globe.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese migrant workers tend to find out quickly that the
international competition they face in Shanghai is no less than that
of Taipei. Worse yet, they also face the threat of being replaced by
increasingly competent mainland workers. And if they falter on the
mainland and return to Taiwan, they face equally gloomy job
prospects.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the gap between salaries for management staff
posted on the mainland and their Taiwan-based counterparts is
gradually narrowing. Six years ago, a mainland-resident management
executive was paid double the salary of a manager of the same ranking
back in Taiwan. But now the ratio has shrunk to between 1.2 times and
1.6 times.</P>
      <P>Even though migrant management executives are usually better paid
on the mainland, they still find it difficult to save money as
homesickness and nostalgia often prompt them to lead gregarious,
extravagant lives there.</P>
      <P>As for finding fresh business opportunities to make big sums of
money, it often turns out to be a pipe dream. The chief of a
Taiwan-financed electronics factory in the Kunshan industrial zone
near Shanghai recalled that he had the idea of launching his own
business when he first arrived on the mainland.</P>
      <P>"However, the longer I stay here, the more cautious I become.
Running a business in mainland China is not as easy as many people
imagine. In Taiwan, you can use US$1 to do business worth US$3. In
contrast, you can do only US$1 worth of business in the mainland for
every US$3 of capital. That's because unexpected risk costs and
overhead are very high here," he explained.</P>
      <P>According to this executive, Taiwan-funded companies are losing
their edge in management and technology. "Their survival on the
mainland mainly relies on their capacity to raise capital and receive
orders fostered over the years in Taiwan, and this ability cannot be
forged solely by the efforts of an individual staff member," he
noted.</P>
      <P>As a result, most Taiwanese migrant workers have complicated
feelings about their mainland career lives. On the one hand, they
have to become more down to earth and minimize their career
ambitions, and on the other they must cope with the crisis of being
replaced by equally qualified mainland competitors willing to work
for less salary.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-yung, a senior adviser with Taipei-based Polaris
Securities Co., who often lectures on the mainland, said that for
Taiwanese who choose to work on the other side of the Taiwan Strait,
"mainlandization" is not a goal. "Their choice just marks the first
step to place themselves in the ever more competitive global talent
market," he observed.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen pointed out that mainland China presently most needs three
kinds of professionals -- those who can assist it in the process of
globalization, management and marketing specialists for high-tech
ventures, and management experts with rich experience in various
service industries.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, Taiwanese migrant workers should endeavor
to enter these professions to reduce the possibility of losing their
mainland jobs.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said Taiwanese who want to work on the mainland
must be capable of learning new knowledge, expertise or technology on
the Internet because information remains limited in many mainland
areas.</P>
      <P>In the face of competition from foreign and mainland skilled
workers, Taiwanese professionals still enjoy certain advantages as
they can speak Mandarin Chinese and can easily integrate themselves
into the mainland market.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese management executive attending a doctoral program at
a university in Beijing said migrant workers from Taiwan can use
their leisure time to pursue advanced studies at selected mainland
universities or graduate schools.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, you can more quickly familiarize yourself with the
general mainland lifestyle and social customs. Moreover, you'll have
a better chance of developing human connections in mainland society,"
said the executive with a Taiwan-funded electronics firm in Beijing,
identifying himself as Mr. Chu.</P>
      <P>Chu said Taiwanese migrant workers, like traditional local
businesses, should think of themselves as an integral part of the
global division of labor and capital flow system.</P>
      <P>"Keep this in mind, then you can make your mainland working
experience a plus for your career and free yourselves from the
quagmire of being denied jobs on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,"
Chu added.</P>
      <P>The most common feeling shared by Taiwanese migrant workers is
that they must "stand ready to work around the clock." For them, work
and life are the same thing. Consequently, they usually opt to return
to Taiwan on holidays.</P>
      <P>The chief manager of the liaison office of a Taiwan securities
firm in Shanghai recalled that when he began to work there, he had a
beautiful plan to visit all the major tourist attractions in
neighboring mainland provinces.</P>
      <P>"However, after two years of working here, I have come to find
that the most familiar landscape I have seen is the scenery along the
road from my office to the Shanghai airport," he said with a lonely
smile.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'TAIPEI DECLARATION' TO BE INCLUDED IN U.N. ARCHIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The "Peace Declaration" made and endorsed
by the 2001 World Citizens Assembly (WCA) in Taipei earlier this week
will be presented to the United Nations for inclusion in the U.N.
archive, Taiwan organizers of WCA activities said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A copy of the "Peace Declaration," which mainly espouses an end
to nuclear threats and global peace, will be presented to the U.N.
headquarters in New York April 13 by Dr. Rashmi Mayur, director of
the International Institute for Sustainable Future and one of the
four WCA 2001 Commission chairpersons who jointly endorsed the
"Taipei Declaration."</P>
      <P>It will be the first time that a document expressing Taiwan
people's voices for peace to be included in the U.N. archive since
the Republic of China on Taiwan was expelled from the United Nations
in 1971, the event organizers said.</P>
      <P>The WCA, a non-governmental organization affiliated with the
United Nations, was established 26 years ago in San Francisco and
dedicated to promoting world peace.</P>
      <P>After the WCA's three-day meeting in Taipei, the first of its
kind ever held in Taiwan, four WCA representatives -- WCA Chairman
Douglas Mattern, Dr. Charles Mercieca, executive vice president of
the International Association of Educators for World Peace, an NGO
organization under the UN, Dr. Hong Tao-tze, president of Tai Ji Men
Qigong Academy in Taipei and Dr. Rashmi Mayur -- jointly endorsed the
declaration.</P>
      <P>According to the declaration, one year into the new millennium,
the threat of nuclear war remains a terrifying possibility and the
militarization of space threatens to ignite a new nuclear arms race.</P>
      <P>The full text of the declaration follows:</P>
      <P>"Whereas, a peaceful sound has not been received in every corner
of the world into everyone's heart; and</P>
      <P>Whereas, through globalization, a widening division between rich
and poor has been created, with 20 percent of the world's population
owning more than 80 percent of the world's wealth and the same rich
20 percent consume 80 percent of the world's resources; and</P>
      <P>Whereas, scientific studies indicate that the present depletion
of the world's resources and climate warming have imperiled the
ecological system, biodiversity and many corporations, along with the
weapons industry, have produced unlimited toxic waste which
exterminated countless thousands of species and imperiled the entire
life system of the planet;</P>
      <P>Therefore, be it resolved that it is imperative to abolish all
nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and the sale of weapons
for profit. The survival of the human race depends on eliminating the
war system with its economic, cultural and political implications.
Future conflicts among peoples must be settled within the peaceful
framework of international law,</P>
      <P>Be it further resolved that globalization must be democratic to
benefit all people, leading to the eradication of poverty and ending
the mass destruction of the world's resources, and not allowing our
technologies to out distance our humanity.</P>
      <P>Be it further resolved that the United Nations must be supported
by both governments and people and be made more democratic and
representative including a People's Assembly to provide moral and
spiritual values alongside the General Assembly of nations.
Furthermore, the Security Council needs to be restructured so as not
to allow any nation to make the world hostage through its present
veto power, and become the institution that provides security to all
the people of the world.</P>
      <P>Be it further resolved that to overcome the culture of war that
ravaged the 20th century, we must create a new culture of peace as
specified by the United Nations 53rd Session of the General Assembly,
and its plan of action. This could be the foundation of a new
civilization based on respect toward all life, with peace in our
hearts and love of the world, with better communication among human
beings, through cultural exchange programs, through peace education,
and where human progress is measured not merely in economic gain, but
through compassion and caring for others.</P>
      <P>Be it further resolved that as responsible citizens of the world,
we call up all peoples, all governments, international institutions
and the United Nations to achieve these goals during the first decade
of the new millennium."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN HOLDS AMIABLE TALKS WITH DALAI LAMA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian held amiable
talks with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, in a
landmark encounter at the Presidential Office Thursday.</P>
      <P>President Chen and the Dalai Lama chatted like old friends, with
the Dalai Lama dressed in a maroon robe and sandals and President
Chen wearing a long white silk scarf called "hada" -- a gift from the
visiting Tibetan spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>Chen, a stalwart from the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), said he appreciates the Dalai Lama's
consistent support for his position that Taiwan's future should be
determined by the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen, who assumed office last May in the Republic of China's
first-ever democratic transfer of power between different political
parties, also thanked the Dalai Lama for sending a large delegation
of the Tibetan government-in-exile to attend his inauguration.</P>
      <P>The human rights lawyer-turned-politician lauded the Dalai Lama
for his long pursuit of freedom and democracy for his communist
Chinese-ruled Himalayan homeland.</P>
      <P>"I know you have endured extreme hardship over the past five
decades for striving for Tibet's freedom and democracy, and I deeply
admire your fortitude and perseverance in facing the tall order,"
Chen told his guest.</P>
      <P>For his part, the Dalai Lama said democratization is Taiwan's
greatest achievement. In his view, the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner
said peace and reason are critical to both political and economic
development.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama praised Chen for his efforts to uphold justice
and impartiality in his governance of Taiwan. He further said he has
always followed the principles of fairness and reason in handling
Tibetan affairs.</P>
      <P>"And when I encounter difficulties, I face them with compassion
and wisdom," the Dalai Lama said, adding he finds that President
Chen has done well in this regard and has managed to place the
top priority on overall national interest and the common well-being
of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Touching on Tibetan affairs, the Dalai Lama said that as the
world is changing, the views of mainland Chinese leaders should
change along with the global trends.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama has gone into exile since a failed uprising in
Tibet in 1959, and Beijing has so far rejected the Tibetan
spiritual leader's demand for greater autonomy for Tibet.</P>
      <P>During his talks with President Chen, the Dalai Lama said
optimistically that the world's concern for Tibet make him hopeful
about the future of his homeland.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama also reaffirmed his belief in democracy, saying he
hopes the Tibetan government-in-exile in the northern Indian city of
Dharamsala can develop a solid democratic system.</P>
      <P>In his view, the Dalai Lama said all Cabinet ministers of the
Tibetan government-in-exile should all be elected by Tibetan
people in order to gain their trust and support. The Dalai Lama
himself already announced in 1992 he will no longer assume any
political duties and will dedicate himself to religious and
charity missions.</P>
      <P>Turning to an appeal by local Buddhist nuns for gender equality,
the Dalai Lama told President Chen that he personally cannot resolve
the issue. "It should be discussed by all nuns and monks," he said,
adding that he thinks Taiwan can sponsor an international Buddhist
meeting on the issue.</P>
      <P>At the end of their hour-long talks, Chen said he hopes to
meet with the Dalai Lama again during the Tibetan spiritual
leader's stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama arrived at the Presidential Office at 8 a.m. on
the traditional Chinese Tombsweeping Day -- a time to remember
deceased ancestors -- in an effort to tone down the sensitivity of
his meeting with President Chen. The Tibetan spiritual
leader and Chen rank high on Beijing's list of distrusted leaders.
Beijing has been watching for signs that the two would team up
against it.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama has stressed that his current 10-day visit to
Taiwan is purely religious in nature. He made his first trip to
the island in 1997.</P>
      <P>During their pleasant meeting, Chen presented the Dalai Lama a
copy of his biography and a wooden Buddha sculpture as gifts.</P>

      <P>He said that Taiwan was closely watching the situation as the
standoff has implications for the island, stressing that "we do not
want the triangular relationship (among Washington, Beijing, and
Taipei) to be confrontational."</P>
      <P>"If China postpones sending the detained U.S. plane and its crew
back, it will only jeopardize its relations with the United States.
Besides, Beijing's candidature to host the 2008 Summer Olympics will
be decided in a few months and any prolonged confrontation will not
be helpful," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>At the same time, delays will only make it easier for U.S.
President Bush to make up his mind on selling defensive weapons to
Taipei, Hsiao noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the professor said that it would be in Bush's interest
to hold on to his election promise of being more firm than former
President Bill Clinton was with mainland China because he cannot
afford to show any signs of weakness in the first few months of his
presidency.</P>
      <P>Speaking about mainland China-Taiwan relations, Hsiao said the
President's Advisory Group on Cross-Strait Relations had recommended
the enhancement of bilateral relations and the advocacy of a "One
China" policy in line with the ROC's Constitution.</P>
      <P>On India-Taiwan relations, the professor said that although the
political relationship cannot be strengthened for obvious reasons,
mainland China should not worry if the two countries develop stronger
technical, business, academic, and cultural relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTRY PROTESTS WHITEWASHING BY JAPANESE HISTORY TEXT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Foreign Ministry
has lodged a protest against Japan for adopting a middle school
history textbook that include whitewashed accounts of the Japanese
invasion of China and Taiwan, a ministry spokeswoman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Katharine S.Y. Chang, director-general of the ministry's
Information and Cultural Affairs Department, said that the Foreign
Ministry first expressed "concern" and "regret" toward the Japanese
government in February when it decided to use the textbook.</P>
      <P>"History must not be distorted," she added.</P>
      <P>Written by right-wing academics, the contents of the textbook
underwent some revisions after South Korea and mainland China also
denounced Japan's decision to adopt it.</P>
      <P>However, the revised textbook still contains passages justifying
Japan's colonial past while excluding or minimizing its atrocities.
It was once again approved for inclusion in Japan's middle school
curriculum in a decision announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the Foreign Ministry immediately urged the
Japanese government to rectify the textbook's content so as to avoid
adverse repercussions on bilateral relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KIDNAPPED TAIWANESE GARMENT DEALER RESCUED IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A female garment dealer from Taiwan, who
was kidnapped in the southeastern mainland Chinese province of Fujian
in early February, has been rescued by mainland police authorities,
the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to CIB officials, the garment dealer, identified only
by her family name Chu, was rescued in the Fujian port city of Xiamen
late Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>CIB agents said mainland police also arrested a Taiwan man
identified as Chang She-chi, and two mainland Chinese men in
Wednesday's operations on suspicion of their involvement in the
abduction.</P>
      <P>CIB agents said they offered tips to Xiamen police earlier this
week on the place where Chu was kept hostage. Acting on the tips, the
mainland police rescued Chu and arrested the three suspects
responsible for monitoring her.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said they have asked mainland police through the
semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation to repatriate both Chang
She-chi and Chu, also a fugitive wanted by local courts.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations showed that Chu, 45, owed some NT$9
million (US$272,727) to a pawn shop in Sanchung, Taipei County. She
fled Taiwan to Hong Kong and Singapore, finally ending up in Fujian
last year. She has been wanted in Taiwan since her creditor filed a
fraud suit against her with the Taipei District Court last year.</P>
      <P>In early February, Chu's creditor allegedly hired mainland
criminals to break into her residence there and force her to repay
her debt by holding her hostage. Chu's family in Taiwan then received
a phone call from her creditor asking for quick debt repayment, and
then lost contact with Chu. Chu's husband reported the kidnapping to
both mainland and Taiwan police authorities Feb. 12.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former Republic of China official in
charge of mainland China-related affairs said here Wednesday that he
sees grim prospects for resumption of dialogue across the Taiwan
Strait this year.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, who headed the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs council
(MAC) during the Kuomintang government era, made the remarks in a
speech delivered at American University.</P>
      <P>Su said the ROC's current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led
government has failed to take any initiative to facilitate resumption
of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is now troubled by serious economic doldrums and the
DPP government' approval rating has plunged a record low level, Su
said, he does not think that mainland China has any interest in
resuming talks with Taiwan to help the DPP administration
improve its poor operational records.</P>
      <P>As to whether the two sides of the Taiwan Strait could resume
talks next year, Su said it will depend on the results of Taiwan's
year-end elections for legislators and local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>Su also criticized President Chen Shui-bian's plan to make
large arms purchases this year.</P>
      <P>"You can't consider arms procurement deals just from the

    <HEADLINE>EDUCATION MINISTER ANNOUNCES REASSIGNMENT OF VICE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Education Minister Ovid Tseng on Thursday
announced that one of his vice ministers will be reassigned to a
lower position as punishment for his part in a public verbal dispute
with another vice minister.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that Administrative Vice Minister Lin Chao-hsien's
position will be "adjusted" because Lin had adversely affected the
ministry's image and internal unity by lashing out at another vice
minister in public, and that Lin has yet to clarify allegations aimed
at his ownership of a piece of real estate in a possible case of
conflict of interest.</P>
      <P>The ministry is currently searching for a candidate to fill Lin's
vacated post, Tseng added.</P>
      <P>However, Lin announced later in the evening that he will not
accept the lower post offered him and will instead submit a letter
Monday expressing his wish to retire.</P>
      <P>Lin explained that he does not believe in the need to return to a
position he had already held in the past because it would not add to
his personal growth and experiences.</P>
      <P>Regarding another possibility of arranging for him to serve as a
Cabinet adviser, Lin, 63, said that being an adviser is not his area
of expertise, and that the position is perhaps best left for "younger
people."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, political Vice Minister Fan Sun-lu was only verbally
reprimanded for what Tseng said was a "disruption of internal
harmony" for her public accusation that "certain education ministry
officials" have formed special interest groups with "a certain
private school."</P>
      <P>Fan's allegation was an insinuation that Lin had financial
involvement with the controversial Jin-Wen Institute of Technology
Board of Directors case, in which it has been alleged that several
legislators and organized crime figures have been involved in
interest-peddling and collusion.</P>
      <P>Fan's remarks led Lin to strike back, publicly calling her a
"bossy amateur."</P>
      <P>Adding to the entangled accusations surrounding the complicated
case, Fan then criticized Lin for failing to avoid possible conflicts
of interest by buying an expensive mansion in a development project
tied to the private Jin-Wen school.</P>
      <P>However, Lin explained that there was no issue of a possible
conflict of interest when he bought the house, and that he had bought
it after considering only whether he could afford it.</P>
      <P>The Jin-Wen case had led to a scuffle in the legislature late
last month in which one lawmaker attacked his female colleague for
what he alleged was her accusation that he had ties to organized
crime and was involved in the board of directors financial and power
dispute.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD MAINTAIN LOW KEY AMID U.S.-MAINLAND CONFLICT: LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should maintain a low key amid the
current tension between the United States and mainland China but take
all necessary precautions for the possible consequences, Republic of
China lawmakers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs Committee,
lawmaker Fan Yang-sheng said that maintaining peace in the Taiwan
Strait is the ROC government's top priority and that Taipei should
pay close attention to subsequent developments following the mid-air
collision between a U.S. surveillance airplane and a mainland Chinese
fighter jet over the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>As the Bush administration has adopted a tougher stance toward
mainland China than its predecessor, Fan said mainland China has come
under strong pressure from the United States. He predicted that
Beijing is unlikely to act against Washington out of consideration of
its huge trade surplus chalked up every year from the U.S. market.</P>
      <P>"The possibility of a military conflict between the two countries
is slim," he said.</P>
      <P>According to the lawmaker, Beijing should have purposely sparked
the tension between the two countries in the hope of using anti-war
elements among the U.S. public to bring pressure to bear on
Washington as a means of gaining more bargaining chips for the
negotiating table.</P>
      <P>Fan said although some people think that the Beijing-Washington
spate would benefit Taiwan, he suggested that the government keep in
mind that peace across the Taiwan Strait is the most important issue.</P>
      <P>Echoing Fan's remarks, lawmaker Kuan Wo-nuan said that the
incident seems to be an about-face.</P>
      <P>Although Kuan contended that mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin is also facing an escalating pressure from the mainland Chinese
people, he said Jiang has already made a noticeable compromise by
allowing U.S. officials to meet the 24-member crew, who were detained
by mainland Chinese authorities after their emergency landing on
Hainan Island following the collision.</P>
      <P>According to Kuan, it will be hard for Taiwan to benefit from the
incident, because mainland China is likely to use the opportunity to
attempt to force a Washington decision to stop selling arms to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The whole matter could be a Beijing plot to prevent U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan, " he noted.</P>
      <P>Kuan urged President Chen Shui-bian to maintain a low profile but
to take all necessary precautions, including placing the military on
the first-level combat alert.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will nominate a
man who once tried to assassinate the late Taiwan strongman President
Chiang Ching-kuo to serve as a Republic of China ambassador-at-large,
according to a local newspaper report Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang Wen-hsiung is one of 12 nominees to serve as the island's
envoys with no specified posting, said the China Times.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted a Presidential Office official as saying that
Wang was awarded the honor because of his association with various
international human rights organizations. He is the most suitable
person to speak out for the island, with the exception of well-known
dissident writer Po Yang, also known as Kuo Yi-tong, who was not
chosen due to his old age and poor health, the official added.</P>
      <P>Huang was one of two would-be assassins who tried to kill
then-Vice Premier Chiang Ching-kuo in 1970 at a Washington hotel when
Chiang was there on an official visit.</P>
      <P>Huang fired the only shot in the assassination attempt, which was
unsuccessful. Huang and his accomplice were arrested at the time but
jumped bail later and fled the United States.</P>
      <P>He returned to Taiwan in 1996 after the statute of limitations on
his charges had expired and was greeted as a hero by local
pro-independence activists.</P>
      <P>Huang was not among the nine ambassador-at-large nominees
initially suggested by the Foreign Ministry but President Chen added
him to the list along with two others at the last minute.</P>
      <P>The posts were introduced by former President Lee Teng-hui in the
hope of tapping the talent and experience of the appointees to
enhance the country's international profile.</P>
      <P>Lee gave the positions to business magnate Jeffrey Koo, retired
ambassador Loh I-cheng, and Chiu Hungdah, a well-known scholar of
international law.</P>
      <P>President Chen is expected to renominate both Koo and Loh. Chiu,
who resigned in 1999 after President Lee deviated from the Guidelines
for National Unification by claiming that the ties between Taiwan and
mainland China were a special state-to-state relationship, was not on
the list of new nominees.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Coming under criticism from lawmakers,
Council of Agricultural (COA) Chairman Chen Chih-huang admitted
Thursday that the government lacks the NT$20 billion in funds
allocated for agricultural subsidiaries after Taiwan joins the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Calling it a "serious matter," Chen said the COA needs to earmark
a government fund of at least NT$30 billion to subsidize local
farmers' losses in the first year following Taiwan's entry into the
world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>But due to government financial strain, Chen said the COA has up
to now allocated only NT$14.1 billion for the fund. Meanwhile, COA
officials are reserved about whether the COA would be able to earmark
an additional NT$20 billion next year in order to reach the NT$30
billion threshold.</P>
      <P>Several lawmakers from central and southern agricultural areas
have voiced strong discontent about the situation, asking the COA to
seek a solution as soon as possible. The agricultural sector is
expected to be hit hard by competition from foreign imports after the
country is admitted into the WTO.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers warned the government of instability in rural areas
should it fail to protect local farmers by handling the issue
properly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP HEAD ACCUSED OF PULLING STRINGS BEHIND PROBE INTO POLITICAL FOE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Frank Hsieh was accused Thursday of pulling strings to force the
re-opening of a judicial probe into alleged embezzlement by People
First Party (PFP) leader James Soong.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiu Chuang-liang of the PFP claimed that the
so-called "new evidence" put forward by lawyer Hsu Kuo-yung to
prosecutors in a motion for a new probe was actually provided by
Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Chiu disputed Hsieh's claims that he doesn't know Hsu, saying
that Hsu was Hsieh's supporter and financed his branch office in
Taipei's Nangang district in 1992 while Hsieh served as a legislator.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local radio station, Chiu accused Hsieh of
being the mastermind behind a ploy to alienate Soong's PFP from the
major opposition Kuomintang and to dampen Soong' popularity during
the run-up to the yearend legislative election.</P>
      <P>He made the accusation after the Prosecutor's Office of Taiwan
High Court confirmed Tuesday receiving new evidence from an
unidentified source and referring it to a Taipei District Court
prosecutor for review with an eye on re-opening the investigation
into Soong.</P>
      <P>Although the prosecutors didn't reveal who provided the new
evidence, Chiu pointed his finger at Hsieh, claiming that it was a
preemptive political move to prevent the PFP and Kuomintang from
cooperating in the yearend election.</P>
      <P>The controversy stemmed from a Kuomintang charge at the
height of presidential election campaign in 1999, that Soong siphoned
off huge amounts of cash from the party coffers while serving as its
secretary-general.</P>
      <P>A prosecutor assigned to probe Soong cleared him of the charges
on January 20, 2001, and the Kuomintang waived its right to ask for a
re-examination because it was trying to reconcile with Soong's PFP at
the time.</P>
      <P>The detente between the Kuomintang and PFP resulted in a common
front made up of the two parties in the Legislative Yuan to force the
DPP government to reverse its decision to scrap a nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>Soong denounced the re-opening of the case as a political ploy
with a judicial appearance Thursday, claiming that he is the victim
of a dirty political maneuver.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-PRESIDENT CRITICIZED FOR BEING 'UNGRATEFUL'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-level National Taiwan University
Hospital (NTUH) official on Thursday criticized former Republic of
China President Lee Teng-hui for "not knowing how to be grateful."</P>
      <P>NTUH vice president Lin Fang-yu made the criticism in reaction to
what he sees as Lee's inappropriate remarks about NTUH doctors'
medical skills.</P>
      <P>Lee has expressed many times in public that his heart disease was
diagnosed and cured by Japanese doctors, writing off the NTUH
doctors' contributions to his health.</P>
      <P>Lin said Lee has also said he was not totally satisfied with the
performance of the NTUH medical team.</P>
      <P>Lin, who joined the medical team for Lee last year, slammed Lee
for "lacking a grateful mind," being "unlike a Christian," and being
"unfair to NTUH doctors and Dr. Lien Wen-pin, convener of Lee's
medical team."</P>
      <P>Lin said in a news media interview that he did not care whether
his remarks would anger Lee, because "Lee Teng-hui really was wrong"
this time.</P>
      <P>Lin said that NTUH doctors invited Japanese doctors to Taiwan
late last year for a joint cardiac catheter operation for Lee.</P>
      <P>Lin said that in fact, Lee's heart disease was not very serious
but the NTUH invited Japanese doctors to join the operation to be
careful. Lin said that Lee gave high appreciation to the Japanese
doctors while writing off NTUH doctors' contributions to his health.
This gave the medical official the feeling that Lee judges things
with a "Japanese style of thinking."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper,
reported Thursday that Lee is sounding out the possibility of making
a stopover in Japan for a medical examination after his planned trip
to the United States in late April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROFESSOR FROM JAPAN BECOMES NATURALIZED ROC CITIZEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese professor at National Chengchi
University who said she loves Taiwan so much that she wanted to
become a naturalized citizen of the Republic of China, finally had
her wish granted recently.</P>
      <P>Prof. Shizue Fugii, who has taught at Chengchi University's
Department of Japanese Language and Literature for more than 20
years, said she is thrilled that she has finally been granted
permanent residency by the ROC government after a five-year
painstaking process in both Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>A daughter-in-law in Taiwan, Fugii said her official Chinese name
now is Fu Chi-yi, phonetically similar to her Japanese surname.</P>
      <P>Fugii, who came to Taiwan at the age of 25 to study history and
later married a National Taiwan University (NTU) law professor, Hsu
Chieh-lin, after obtaining her doctoral degree, vowed that she would
"live and die" with Taiwan now that she is an ROC citizen.</P>
      <P>She said she decided to apply to become a naturalized citizen of
the ROC in 1996 at a time when people in Taiwan were jittery and
eager to emigrate to a foreign country and there was an evident
flight of capital after Beijing conducted live-ammunition and missile
firing tests in the Taiwan Strait in an attempt to intimidate voters
and influence the outcome of the ROC's presidential election.</P>
      <P>The naturalization application process that took some five years
to complete was bumpy and difficult, she said.</P>
      <P>According to ROC law, she first had to give up her Japanese
citizenship before applying to become an ROC citizen. Her efforts to
give up her Japanese citizenship hit a snag in 1997 when the Japanese
government refused to take up the application on the grounds that
Japan maintains no formal diplomatic relations with the ROC on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With her application efforts in Japan thwarted, she turned to the
ROC authorities. Working with her husband, whom was then the dean of
the NTU College of Law, she managed to influence legislators who
passed an amendment to the ROC nationality and naturalization law.</P>
      <P>By early 2000, the Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the
related statutes, enabling individuals, like Fugii, who have suffered
"uncorrectable" factors preventing them from forsaking their original
citizenship, to be naturalized as ROC citizens.</P>
      <P>A historian known for her research in the history of Taiwan
during the period of Japanese colonial rule, in modern historical
relations between Japan and China, as well as in Asian women's
history, the 52-year-old Fugii strongly criticized the comic book "On
Taiwan," authored by Japanese right-wing cartoonist Yoshinori
Kobayashi, for the book's inaccurate accounts concerning the people
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Only recently, she joined other Taiwan academics in signing an
appeal calling for the Japanese government not to condone the
tampering with and falsifying of historical facts by educational
authorities of textbooks to be published and used for the 2002
academic year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IMPORTED LUXURY CAR SALES NOT AFFECTED BY COOLING ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sales of imported luxury cars in Taiwan
appeared unaffected by the island's slumping automobile market over
the first quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>Despite the slowdown in the Taiwan economy over the first three
months of 2001, sales of Germany's Mercedes-Benz automobiles showed
no signs of decline, maintaining a level comparable to that for the
same period the previous year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Toyota's Corolla, an upgraded four-door sedan that has
been promoted in Taiwan by the Hotai Motor Co., Ltd. since last
month, topped the sales list of locally manufactured cars with nearly
6,000 orders in some 20 days as other Taiwan-manufactured automobiles
struggled over the impact of the cooling economy.</P>
      <P>Hotai officials predicted fierce competition among other car
manufactures if the hot sales of the Toyota Corolla do not trigger
sales of other similarly priced automobiles.</P>
      <P>Market sources said that the drop in sales of Taiwan-manufactured
cars and booming imported luxury sedan sales indicate a growing gap
between rich and poor in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HAS NOT HEIGHTEN COMBAT ALERT OVER 'COLLISION' INCIDENT: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen said
Friday the Republic of China military has not heightened its combat
alert after a midair collision between a U.S. surveillance plane and
a mainland Chinese fighter in the South China Sea last Sunday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan plenary session, Wu
said the ROC armed forces have maintained its original combat
readiness in the wake of the U.S.-mainland Chinese military aircraft
collision.</P>
      <P>Wu also denied a newspaper report that President Chen Shui-bian
has canceled his plan to review the ongoing Hankuang No. 17 combined
services military training exercise simply because of the "collision"
incident.</P>
      <P>"The report was incorrect," the minister said, adding that the
military has not arranged for President Chen to attend the
current training exercise in the first place. "The president's
absence from the military training drill has nothing to do
with the 'collision' incident," Wu stressed.</P>
      <P>He further explained that the annual Hankuang exercise covers
two stages -- live-fire training drills by various military units at
their bases and cyberwar games to be held in Taipei later this
month.</P>
      <P>Wu said Premier Chang Chun-hsiung has directed relevant
government agencies, including the Ministry of National Defense
(MND), to keep a close watch on the developments in the "collision"
incident.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that the United States and mainland China can
properly resolve the 'collision' issue in accordance with the
general international regulations and practices," the minister
noted.</P>
      <P>Asked whether similar incidents could happen in the sky of
the Taiwan Strait, Wu said the military has ordered all ROC air
force pilots to refrain from taking any provocative actions while
performing their flight duties.</P>
      <P>Wu also said the ROC government has not held any special
military meeting in the wake of the U.S.-mainland Chinese military
aircraft collision incident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANNAN MEETS WITH DRUG GIANTS TO PLAN STEPS AGAINST HIV/AIDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  5  (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Thursday met in Amsterdam with representatives from six of the
world's leading pharmaceutical companies to discuss what further
steps need to be taken to improve access to better health care, HIV
medicines and HIV-related medicines for developing countries.</P>
      <P>According to a joint press release by the United Nations and the
World Health Organization, Annan met with CEOs and senior executives
from Abbott Laboratories, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Glaxo Smith Kline, Hoffman-La Roche, and Pfizer.</P>
      <P>The meeting was also attended by Gro Harlem Brundtland,
director-general of WHO, and Peter Piot, executive director of the
joint U.N. Programme on HIV/AIDS.</P>
      <P>The companies have made significant progress individually in
providing an expanded number of drugs to combat AIDS, including
antiretrovirals and treatments for opportunistic infections. Prices
have also come down substantially as a result of the companies'
individual actions. Annan urged the companies at the meeting to
continue and accelerate these actions.</P>
      <P>Special emphasis was placed on the world's least developed
countries, particularly those in Africa, as well as on the need for
continued country-by-country negotiations in other developing
countries.</P>
      <P>All those attending the meeting recognized that qualified
non-governmental organizations and appropriate private companies
offering health care to employees and local communities in these
nations should also be considered for increased accessibility to
HIV/AIDS medicines.</P>
      <P>"We need to combine incentive for research with access to
medication for the poor," Annan said in a statement released the same
day, adding that intellectual property protection is key to bringing
forward new medicines, vaccines and diagnostics urgently needed by
the world's poorest people.</P>
      <P>He called for a major mobilization of political will and
significant additional funding to enable a dramatic leap forward in
prevention, education, care and treatment of HIV and AIDS.</P>
      <P>In a number of countries, decades of development are being
reversed by the effects of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Some 36.1
million people are living with HIV or AIDS worldwide, with 5.3
million being infected during 2000 alone. Also in 2000, 3 million
people died of AIDS, bringing the total number of deaths since the
start of the epidemic to 21.8 million.</P>
      <P>The spread of the epidemic and its devastating impact on humanity
has alarmed the United Nations and prompted it to convene a Special
Session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS at the highest political
level, to be held June 25-27 in New York City.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC GOV'T EXPRESSES CONDOLENCES TO MISSING CHINESE PILOT'S FAMILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, April 5 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's top envoy to Canada
said Thursday that the ROC government would like to express its
condolences to the family of missing Chinese pilot Wang Wei whose jet
fighter went down after a collision with a U.S. surveillance plane
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Thomas T.P. Chen, who recently assumed the post of representative
of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, Canada, also expressed
his home government's regret over the unhappy incident.</P>
      <P>During a live interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.,
Chen urged both sides to resolve the situation quickly by diplomatic
means as a prolonged standoff could have a major impact on peace and
security in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>He added that Taipei hopes, and expects, that the mid-air
collision will not affect the U.S. plan to sell defensive weapons to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the root cause of the incident, Chen said Beijing has been
boosting its military power aggressively and intimidating Taiwan
verbally and militarily. This kind of behavior has affected peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific, prompting the U.S. to beef up
surveillance in the area, he noted.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, the best solution would be for mainland China
to stop its threats of an armed attack against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On cross-straits relations, he repeated President Chen
Shui-bian's statements that the ROC government is willing to talk
with Beijing on any topic, including trade, cultural exchanges and
even political integration, if Beijing does not set any
pre-conditions for such talks and stops its threatening strategy.</P>
      <P>Beijing has insisted it will enter into negotiations with Taipei
only if the latter agrees to the so-called "one China" principle.
Beijing has also insisted on its right to use military force to
settle its dispute with Taipei if the latter delays talks
indefinitely.</P>

      <P>Scott Reid, a Canadian Alliance federal
legislator from Ontario, urged his government Thursday to co-sponsor
a United Nations resolution that would censure Communist China for
its human rights abuses.</P>
      <P>"Canada must join the growing international community in

Tibetan Buddhists and Christians," Reid said.</P>
      <P>During a press conference, Reid cited the case of Prof. Kunlun
Zhang, who was recently released from a jail in mainland China, as
"proof that the Chinese government will bend to international
pressure and that a Canadian involvement can effect the struggle to
promote human rights in China."</P>
      <P>If Canada fails to support a U.N. motion to censure
Communist China, it is tantamount to suggesting that it is acceptable
to mistreat peaceful citizens for exercising their freedom of
conscience, he said.</P>
      <P>"I call on the Canadian government to do the honorable thing, and
lend its voice to the growing international community opposed to
China's treatment of its Falun Gong practitioners," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. House Democratic leader Richard A.
Gephardt on Thursday urged Beijing to immediately release the U.S.
Navy's SP-3 surveillance aircraft and its crew being held on mainland
China's Hainan Island.</P>
      <P>In a statement in response to the ongoing situation regarding the
collision between the U.S. Navy aircraft and a Communist Chinese
fighter jet, Rep. Gephardt (D-Mo.) pointed out that "part of the
problem here is that the government in Beijing "does not have a
tradition of adherence to the rule of law and fundamental human
rights."</P>
      <P>"The current situation is further evidence that we must continue
to press for China's compliance with the rule of law and global
standards if it intends to work constructively with the international
community," he added.</P>
      <P>Calling the mid-air collision "an unfortunate accident that
occurred in international airspace," the congressman from Missouri
said that as President George W. Bush has noted, "it is regrettable
that China lost a pilot and his aircraft in this inc ident."</P>
      <P>"I hope that given these circumstances, the Chinese government
will release our aircraft and our service men and women as soon as
possible so that they may be reunited with their families. The tough
talk of the past few days is no substitute for the determined
diplomatic steps that are needed to ensure the expeditious return of
our crew and aircraft," Gephardt added.</P>
      <P>But he emphasized that based on the information he received about
the incident and relevant international laws, "I do dot believe that
an apology is warranted in this situation."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA TO PROMOTE REASONABLE BROKERAGE FEES FOR FOREIGN LABORERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will
work to promote reasonable brokerage fees for foreigner laborers by
using the level of a country's brokerage fees to determine how many
workers to introduce from a particular country, CLA Chairman Chen Chu
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after receiving clergy members from the
Chunan Holy Family Catholic Church, which has asked Chen to help
solve the problem of Vietnamese workers being charged exorbitant
brokerage fees.</P>
      <P>Peter Nguyen Van Hung of the Chunan Holy Family Catholic Church,
who sheltered Vietnamese workers and thus became entangled in a
dispute with the Vietnam Economic Cultural Office in Taipei, called
on the CLA for assistance.</P>
      <P>Chen said that foreign laborers in Taiwan will have a legal
channel to make complaints if they are unfairly treated and that the
CLA appreciates the efforts made by the church to protect the foreign
laborers.</P>
      <P>But Chen also noted that the nation will not tolerate foreign
laborers running away from their jobs, noting that if they do so and
are caught, they will be repatriated.</P>
      <P>Father Nguyen said that Vietnamese workers not only have to pay a
brokerage fee of about US$3,200, they also have to pay an extra fee
of 12 percent of their monthly salary to the brokerage companies in
Vietnam each month, which he said was quite unreasonable.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the charging of unreasonable brokerage fees has
been going on for a long time and that the CLA hopes a direct
employment system via the two countries or a system operated by
non-profit groups will be established to make brokerage fees more
reasonable.</P>
      <P>She also said that the countries exporting labor to Taiwan should
protect their own nationals and that the council will use the level
of a country's brokerage fees as a reference when deciding how many
workers to introduce from a particular country.</P>
      <P>She said that if the brokerage fees being asked of nationals of a
particular country are too unreasonably high, then Taiwan may stop
introducing laborers from that country into its labor market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER RESIGNS OVER JIN WEN INSTITUTE CORRUPTION SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister without Portfolio Chang Yu-huei
offered to resign Friday in the wake of implied allegations of his
involvement in a corruption scandal involving a technology institute
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on Friday approved the written
resignation submitted by Chang, who has been a minister without
portfolio since May 20, 2000 when the new Democratic Progressive
Party-ruled administration took office.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging Chang's resignation, the premier noted that law
enforcement authorities will investigate the alleged loan and
corruption scandal involving the privately-run Jin Wen Institute of
Technology "based only on facts and evidence, rather than on who the
alleged accused are."</P>
      <P>The premier invited Chang to be an adviser to the Executive Yuan,
to which Chang did not express acceptance or refusal as of Friday
noon.</P>
      <P>In his resignation statement, Chang, a senior Kuomintang member
who has held various governmental posts, including secretary-general
of the Executive Yuan, in his 38-year stint working as a public
functionary, stressed his innocence and said he has never accepted
bribes or made personal gains from the Jin Wen scandal.</P>
      <P>Chang, who had been chairman of state-run Taiwan Aluminum Corp.
and Taiwan Sugar Corp. between 1990 and 1997, said he believes that
the judicial system will serve justice by finding out the truth in
his favor.</P>
      <P>Chang's resignation marked the second time a Cabinet-level
official has been affected by the Jin Wen scandal. Vice Education
Minister Lin Chao-hsien submitted his resignation Thursday, which was
approved by Education Minister Ovid Tzeng the same day.</P>
      <P>The Jin Wen scandal was not unearthed until March 28 after
Independent Legislator Lo fu-chu physically assaulted a female
legislative colleague, Diane Lee, resulting in her being hospitalized
and the scandal being brought to light. It has been alleged that in
the Jin Wen scandal, several legislators, ranking government
officials and organized crime figures have been involved in
interest-peddling and collusion.</P>
      <P>Since the scandal came to light last week, one of Chang's sons
has been found to be the owner of a resort house in Taipei County
which was developed by the Jin Wen Institute of Technology and was
given to the junior Chang for almost nothing.</P>
      <P>In his resignation, Chang said that the house was bought by his
son legally and that his brother-in-law, who handled the purchase
several years ago, will make a public explanation shortly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>3 TAIWAN MEN ARRESTED IN MEXICO ON CHARGES OF GREENBACK SMUGGLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Mexico  City,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Chen Chang-hui and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China representative
office in Mexico said Thursday it is negotiating with Mexican law
enforcement authorities over the arrest of three Taiwanese men at
Mexico City's international airport earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Mexican police arrested the three Taiwan businessmen Tuesday
evening on charges of attempting to smuggle a large amount of hard
currency out of Mexico.</P>
      <P>The ROC representative office in Mexico City said it has sent
staff members to contact Mexican law enforcement authorities over the
issue. "We'll also offer all necessary assistance to our three
expatriates," said a representative office official.</P>
      <P>The three arrested ROC nationals were identified as Tseng
Ching-mu, Lee Shih-chung and Yang Jui-liang. The trio jointly manage
Penmex Co., a Mexico City company specializing in producing pens and
relevant accessories. Among them, Tseng is the boss.</P>
      <P>As Lee Shih-chung holds passports from the ROC, the United
States, Argentina and Chile, the case has caused concern from the
U.S., Argentine and Chilean embassies here.</P>
      <P>The three men were leaving for San Francisco when they were
spotted by Mexican police at the airport. Extensive body searches
discovered that the trio were carrying a total of US$445,000 (about
NT$14.7 million) in cash and traveler's checks.</P>
      <P>According to Mexican customs regulations, each departing
passenger is limited to carrying US$20,000 out of the country, so
Mexican police are treating the case as a serious crime. The matter
also caught the attention of major Mexican television stations, as
the trio had tied the money onto their bodies, a practice rarely seen
in Mexico.</P>
      <P>Mexican prosecutors said they may indict the three men Friday on
charges of money laundering.</P>
      <P>As Mexico imposes stringent restrictions on outbound capital
remittances, many Taiwanese working in Mexico reportedly often resort
to illegal ways to take hard currency out of the country in order to
evade taxes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND WITCH HEALER APPEALS FOR DISMISSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese witch doctor Zhang Ying,
who has been prohibited from leaving Taiwan since January on charges
of fraud and engaging in illicit medical practices, appealed Friday
for the Taipei Prosecutors Office to dismiss the case and let her
leave Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zhang asked the Taipei prosecutors for her release so that she
can return to the United States, as she is five months pregnant and
feels miserable living in limbo in Taipei away from her relatives.</P>
      <P>A crying Zhang, believed to be in her late 30s or early 40s, said
she hates living in her current state of limbo. She asked for a quick
resolution of the charges that she illegally practiced medicine in
Taipei followed by an early release on parole, with which she said
she would fully cooperate and return to Taiwan for further
questioning whenever she is subpoenaed.</P>
      <P>On Zhang's appeal, Taipei prosecutors ruled out an immediate
dismissal for her on the grounds that there are still some facts that
she must clarify. They added that law enforcement authorities are
still conducting chemical analysis on the medicine that she claimed
she had produced from mid-air during her public performances of
healing magic in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who claims to be able to see through people's bodies and
diagnose their diseases, caused a sensation in Taiwan in January
after displaying her so-called "power" at a local television station
by "snatching pills out of thin air" and handing them out to her
"patients."</P>
      <P>Taiwan reporters said that Zhang was certified by the government
of mainland China as a "person with miraculous power" and that she
charged between NT$6,000 and NT$10,000 for each magic "treatment."</P>
      <P>However, one of her performances in front of TV cameras on Jan. 5
was challenged by a local magician, who attended Zhang's performance
and pointed out that her so-called "supernatural power" was nothing
more than a simple sleight-of-hand trick.</P>
      <P>Zhang failed to produce any more medicine during her Jan. 5
performance after being disrupted by the magician, giving the
convenient excuse that she could not concentrate her power in the
presence of someone who doubted her abilities.</P>
      <P>A few days later, she was summoned to the Taipei Prosecutors'
Office for questioning and consequently was prohibited from leaving
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who lives in the United States, arrived in Taiwan in late
December with her Taiwan-born husband for a short visit. She now
lives alone at her mother-in-law's home in Taipei, since both her
husband and the mother-in-law have been living in the United States.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is closely watching
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's current six-country tour of
Latin America, a senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official
said Friday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said Jiang's 12-day visit will
take him to three major MERCOSUR countries -- Brazil, Argentina and
Chile -- as well as to the neighboring nations of Uruguay, Cuba and
Venezuela.</P>
      <P>"As Latin America has been the ROC's diplomatic stronghold, many
of our diplomatic allies in the area fully understand the advantages
of making friends with us," Chang said, adding that bilateral
relations between the ROC and its individual Latin American allies
have been solid and cordial.</P>
      <P>Chang said ROC embassies and representative offices in various
Latin American countries have full information about Jiang's
itinerary and agenda for his current tour.</P>
      <P>Chang also unveiled a detailed report on steps taken by mainland
Chinese authorities from May 2000 through January this year to deny
the ROC's sovereignty, downgrade its international status, sabotage
its relations with diplomatic allies and interfere with its
substantive exchanges with other countries.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chang said, mainland China has spared no effort to
hinder the ROC embassies and representative offices from staging
National Day and presidential inauguration celebrations as well as to
block Taiwan's participation in international activities and
organizations and ROC officials' overseas travel plans.</P>
      <P>Chang further said mainland China has stepped up its efforts to
court overseas Chinese groups and drive wedges between the ROC and
overseas Chinese communities in various countries.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang said ROC diplomats will not be daunted by
mainland China's constant diplomatic offensive against Taiwan and
will redouble their efforts to expand the country's external ties.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April  6 (CNA)
(By Huang Kuei-mei and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese daily newspaper reported Friday
that Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori has instructed the Foreign Ministry
to consider granting a visa to allow a visit to Japan by former
Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>The mass circulation Mainichi Shimbun said Mori made the
instruction partly for humanitarian reasons and partly out of
dissatisfaction with Beijing for its persistent use of the issue of
Lee's attempted visit to Japan as a diplomatic bargaining chip
against Japan. Mori offered to resign from his position Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the Mainichi Shimbun report, Lee hopes to visit
Japan for the main purpose of having his heart checked in early May
on his way home from the United States, where he will revisit his
alma mater Cornell University in late April.</P>
      <P>Through informal channels, Lee has already begun to sound out the
possibility of obtaining an entry visa from the Japanese government,
the Mainichi Shimbun report said.</P>
      <P>Lee, who received Japanese education during his formative years
in Taiwan and later went on to study at the prestigious University of
Kyoto, wanted to attend an Asia Outlook forum in Japan last autumn.
However, that plan was aborted owing to Beijing's opposition and
intervention.</P>
      <P>Later on Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda dismissed
the Mainichi Shimbun report, describing it as untrue and groundless.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS WIDE SUPPORT FOR RESTRICTIONS ON MAINLAND INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of Taiwan people support
government restrictions on mainland China-bound investment, a senior
mainland affairs official said Friday.</P>
      <P>"This is the finding of a recent opinion poll sponsored by the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)," said MAC Vice Chairman Lin
Chong-pin.</P>
      <P>Lin said the council commissioned National Sun Yat-sen
University last month to survey local people's opinions whether the
government should impose strings on investment across the Taiwan
Strait as the Cabinet is mulling how to adjust the present "no haste,
be patient" mainland investment policy to meet market demand.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a telephone survey of 1,077 randomly
selected adult residents, conducted from March 25-28, Lin said that
as much as 82.5 percent of those interviewed support
enactment of government regulations to control mainland
China-bound investment.</P>
      <P>Only 15 percent said they don't think that the government should
impose restrictions on launching investment projects on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Poll results also showed that 55.6 percent of the respondents
want the government to impose even more stringent restrictions on
mainland investments; 26 percent said the government should
moderately ease current restrictions; and 4.1 percent said they see
no need to adjust the existing "no haste" policy.</P>
      <P>Asked about their views on the direct cross-strait transport
links, 83.2 percent said the government should open direct
cross-strait shipping and air links under certain conditions, such
as the principles of national security, dignity and parity; but 8.9
percent said they think direct cross-strait transport links should
be opened unconditionally.</P>
      <P>In addition, 53.6 percent said they agree with the concept that
opening direct cross-strait shipping and air links may affect
national security; while 36.9 percent said they disagree with such
an idea.</P>
      <P>The same survey further found that 73.9 percent oppose mainland
China's "one country, two systems" unification scheme, roughly same
as the average level recorded in previous MAC surveys.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 16.1 percent threw support behind the "one country,
two systems" proposal, slightly higher than the percentage
registered a similar MAC survey conducted in May 2000.</P>
      <P>As for local people's stances on Taiwan's future, 87.78 percent
support the roughly defined concept of "maintaining the current
status quo," including those who want to see permanent maintenance of
the status quo or prefer to move toward unification or independence
after a certain period of time.</P>
      <P>Compared with the findings of previous surveys, the percentage
of those who support the proposal of "moving toward unification
after maintaining the status quo for sometime" increased slightly.</P>
      <P>Touching on the development of future cross-strait ties, 37.1
percent said they think that cross-strait relations will ease; 26.4
percent said they expect no change in bilateral Taiwan-mainland
China ties; and 16.7 percent said they think that cross-strait ties
may become more tense.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's domestic large-scale investments
decreased sharply in March due to low investor sentiment and the
rapid relocation of local factories abroad, according to statistics
published Friday by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>The MOEA statistics show that the number of new investment
projects worth over NT$200 million (US$6.08 million) reached only
four in March, with a total value of NT$23.8 billion.</P>
      <P>The March figure represented a decrease of hundreds of millions
of NT dollars since January and February, and a reduction of 15.77
percent over the same month last year.</P>
      <P>The number of large-scale investments in January reached five,
with a combined value of NT$68.1 billion; while in February the
number reached six projects worth a total of NT$95.1 billion.</P>
      <P>In aggregate, the value of large-scale investments in the first
three months reached NT$187.1 billion, in comparison with NT$306.8
million in the 117 projects during the same period last year.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials attributed last year's large figure mainly to the
remaining construction work on the nation's sixth naphtha cracker
plant.</P>
      <P>However, the officials admitted that considering the domestic
investment figures over the last two years, large-scale investments
projects are getting larger, but fewer in number as small- and
medium-sized enterprises have stopped making large-scale investments.
The officials reminded the government to consider this as a warning
sign and take measures to face it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA URGES MEXICO TO TREAT ARRESTED ROC NATIONALS FAIRLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of Foreign
Affairs announced Friday that its representative office in Mexico has
already urged local law enforcement authorities to treat three
arrested ROC nationals fairly, without bias and according to the law.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Katharine S.Y. Chang said that
Mexican prosecutors have told the ROC representative office that the
three men were arrested at Mexico City's international airport
earlier Tuesday for allegedly violating Mexico's National Security
Law.</P>
      <P>According to the law, which was promulgated March 1, anyone
entering or leaving Mexico with over US$10,000 must declare the
amount through customs, Mexican prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>The three men were allegedly found to be carrying US$445,000 in
U.S. dollars and travelers checks, which they had bundled to their
bodies. Mexican police arrested the men on suspicion of illegal money
laundering.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the Foreign Ministry will closely watch further
developments. She also urged ROC nationals to pay close attention to
the announcement of new laws when leaving or entering other countries
in the future.</P>
      <P>The three arrested ROC nationals were identified as Tseng
Ching-mu, Lee Shih-tsung and Yang Jui-liang. The trio jointly manage
Penmex Co., a Mexico City company headed by Tseng that specializes in
pens and relevant accessories.</P>
      <P>As Lee holds passports from the Republic of China, the United
States, Argentina and Chile, the case has also aroused the attention
of the U.S., Argentine and Chilean embassies in Mexico.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSUMER PRICE INDEX DOWN SLIGHTLY IN MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) in
March decreased by 0.27 percent compared to the previous month due to
slower consumption amid the sluggish economy, according to a
government statement.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) Friday indicated that the
consumer price index registered 102.96 in March while the wholesale
price index in the same month reached 95.91. The wholesale price
index represented a decline of 0.3 percent over February's figure and
the first negative growth in 17 months.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed the drop in wholesale prices to the
low international prices for crude oil, plastic and chemical
materials, machinery, optical instruments and pulp, which drove the
average import price down by 5.75 percent in March compared to the
same month of last year.</P>
      <P>In aggregate, the consumer price index increased by 0.58 percent
in the first quarter over the same period of last year. Asked if the
continued low consumer prices signifies slowing consumption or
deflation, the DGBAS officials said they cannot say until the release
of May's statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN COUNTY CHIEF URGES REGULATORY REVIEW OF 'MINI THREE LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  April  6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen County Chief Chen Shui-tsai Friday
urged the central government to review the existing regulations over
the "mini three links" between Taiwan-controlled offshore islands and
certain mainland Chinese ports.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that there is a huge gap between the policy goals
and the present situation of the partial trade, shipping and postal
links between the two sides, Chen voiced his hope that the central
government in Taipei would adjust the current measures so as to
efficiently improve bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the goals of the "mini three links" policy are
correct, but ineffective regulations and barriers from the mainland
Chinese side have created a situation in which the desired links
across the Taiwan Strait are not truly established.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a county-level meeting called to examine
the results of the first-stage "mini three links," which were
established in the beginning of this year between the Republic of
China-controlled Kinmen and Matsu islands and selected ports of
mainland China's Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Over the past three months, two-way regular cargo and passenger
shipping services have remained intact, and a total of 1,401 Taiwan
passengers and 91 mainland Chinese travelers have visited the
opposite side on irregular shipping services.</P>
      <P>During the same period, only a single mainland Chinese cargo ship
has made the trip, carrying 400 cubic meters of gravel to Kinmen,
with no such vessels from either Kinmen or Matsu having sailed across
the strait.</P>
      <P>Under mounting public pressure, local opinion leaders have
expressed strong doubts that the opening of the "mini three links"
will benefit local people and boost local development. They blamed
the Kinmen county authorities for the current situation.</P>
      <P>Clarifying the misunderstanding, Chen said the central government
and the mainland Chinese side, rather than the local authorities,
should be held accountable for the alleged failure.</P>
      <P>Analyzing opinions from all parties concerned, including central
government officials stationed in Kinmen and local private groups,
Chen urged the central government to take concrete measures quickly
to build Kinmen into a cross-strait trade and fishing center as well
as develop the island into a business management center for
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>In addition, he pointed out that regulations governing bilateral
trade, academic, and humanitarian exchanges should be further relaxed
as a way of helping create a positive relationship between the two
sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-DEPRESSION ORGANIZATION TO BE FORMED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwanese Society of Psychiatry (TSP)
has announced that it will form an organization to fight
psychological depression and suicide.</P>
      <P>In a symposium on depression, TSP President Lee Ming-ping said
the Anti-depression Union is in the process of being formed. He noted
that the World Health Organization (WHO) lists depression, cancer and
AIDS, as the three top killers of the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The WHO estimates that about 400 million people around the world
suffer from the mental disorder, which involves intense moods of
sadness, grief, disappointment and loneliness. In extreme cases, the
disease leads sufferers to harm or kill themselves, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics prepared by the Department of Health, Lee said
suicide, a symptom of depression, is the third leading cause of death
among Taiwanese youth aged between 15 and 24.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted jointly by National Chengkung University and
Kaohsiung Medical School in southern Taiwan found that 37.7 percent
of people aged 65 and above in the survey had suffered from various
mental disorders within a month before they were interviewed, said
Lee.</P>
      <P>That figure include 15.3 percent suffering from slight
depression, 5.9 percent from serious depression, and 0.7 percent from
schizophrenia.</P>
      <P>Lee said the elderly and teenagers are at the highest risk from
depression and suicide. Their vulnerability to suicide highlights the
fact that mental treatment and mental health are vital parts of the
health of the whole body, he added.</P>
      <P>He warned his audience that depression, dementia and suicide come
along with the aging process of people; and self-harm, suicide and
substance abuse among teenagers are set to be major challenges facing
humanity in this century.</P>
      <P>In an unrelated event, famous Ho Lo Opera performer Sun Tsui-feng
made public at a press conference Friday her own experiences of
depression and her subsequent recovery.</P>
      <P>Sun said her experience with the disorder has improved her
knowledge of the disease and has helped her realize that health and
life are invaluable.</P>
      <P>Citing her own case as example, the smiling Sun told a packed
room that she experienced long periods of fatigue, fear and sadness
during the previous year, and was diagnosed with depression rather
than what she initially suspected was a heart condition.</P>
      <P>With the help of medication prescribed by doctors and the support
of her family, Sun said her disorders are now well under control. She
encouraged people who suffer from similar symptoms to come out of the
shadows and seek medical treatment.</P>
      <P>At the press briefing, Sun also unveiled a television commercial
she shot for the Department of Health. In the commercial Sun urges
the public to accept and help depressed people, stressing that the
disorder can be cured.</P>

Administration rushed into the South China Sea Friday to look into

operating there.</P>

stains near Captain Kung Chin-ji's quarters and suspected foul play.</P>
      <P>He said on the radio that all the ship's eight crewmen are
mainland Chinese, except the captain and himself.</P>
      <P>Scuffles between Taiwan ship officers and mainland Chinese
crewmen are not unusual, and casualties have been reported before.</P>

      <P>Kurt Campbell, a former U.S. defense
official in charge of Asia Pacific affairs, said at a recent seminar
that he believes the new U.S. administration will make a "robust"
decision to sell arms to Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan
Relations Act.</P>
      <P>He said at a seminar in Atlanta Wednesday that the United States
should regard Asia security issues as vital factors in its global
strategic considerations instead of merely considering its trade
interests in Asia as it did in the past.</P>
      <P>Campbell, a deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Clinton
administration and now senior vice president of the Washington-based
think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, added that
the United States supports Taiwan security because of the island's
democratic and economic developments.</P>
      <P>He added that because Asian countries -- including the Republic
of China -- do not want to see the United States and mainland China
in conflict, the Bush administration should continue to engage
Beijing and establish bilateral communication mechanisms so as to
avoid possible misunderstandings and conflicts that will lead to
regional instability.</P>
      <P>At the same seminar, which was co-sponsored by the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in Atlanta and the Georgia Institute of

mainland China to resume dialogue with Taiwan without preconditions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DALAI LAMA DONATES US$ 150,000 TO TAIWAN'S EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dalai Lama announced Saturday that he
will donate US$150,000 toward the reconstruction of the region in
central Taiwan that was ravaged by a killer earthquake in September
1999.</P>
      <P>Of that amount, US$100,000 will come from religious contributions
by the Dalai Lama's local followers, while the remaining US$50,000
will come from the Dalai Lama himself.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama made the surprise announcement during an
empowerment blessing ritual attended by over 20,000 followers.</P>
      <P>The "Thousand-armed and Thousand-eyed Bodhisattva of Mercy
Empowerment Ritual," a two-day ceremony that began Friday with
spiritual cleansing preparations, was held at the indoor stadium of
the National College of Physical Education and Sports in northern
Taiwan's Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The ceremony, which the Dalai Lama had also performed once before
during his previous visit to Taiwan in 1997, drew in local crowds
that hoped to be blessed by the Tibetan spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>However, the Dalai Lama repeated his warning that a single
empowerment ritual would not necessarily free one completely from
worldly shackles and worries.</P>
      <P>Instead, he urged his followers to embrace bodhicitta -- an
enlightened mindset based on the belief of moral consequences -- and
to obey the commandments of Buddhism.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some of Taiwan's farmers will face
difficulties in changing their line of employment after the island
becomes a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the chairman
of the Council of Agriculture under the Executive Yuan said Friday.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Chen Chih-huang stressed that the council will take
the responsibility of assisting farmers who grow bananas, tobacco and
sugar cane in finding new employment, adding that some 20,000 to
30,000 farmers in different fields will have to find different
occupations after Taiwan joins the WTO, expected some time later this
year or next year.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the production of sugar cane, bananas and tobacco
was formerly managed by the Taiwan Sugar Corp., the Taiwan Province
Fruit Marketing Cooperative and the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Board
under the supervision of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Finance, respectively.</P>
      <P>Predicting that Taiwan will obtain WTO membership as soon as the
end of this year, Chen said that the three government-controlled
organizations have been trying to pass to the COA the "hot potato" of
helping domestic farmers find new jobs at a time when Taiwan's
agricultural sector is facing the imminent challenges set to
materialize when the island joins the WTO.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WOMEN CARVING OUT NICHE IN MAINLAND CHINA (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>They can be tough and they can also be
tender. This is the best portrayal of Taiwan women seeking reunion
with their better halves or career achievements in mainland China.</P>
      <P>And if every Taiwan businessman has endured hardship in his
mainland career adventure, the stories of Taiwan women who have moved
across the Taiwan Strait are even more touching and impressive.</P>
      <P>The greatest impetus that prompts Taiwan women to take residence
in mainland China lies in their drive to assist their husbands in
business operations or simply to live together with their spouses.
Still, some more career-minded women have traveled to the mainland to
seek better job opportunities or pursue advanced study.</P>
      <P>The boss of a Taiwan-funded corporation in Shanghai, identified
himself as Mr. Ho, said that with the quality of mainland college
students upgrading steadily, he finds no difficulties recruiting
qualified mainland factory and administrative management staff.</P>
      <P>"But I have not bothered to find a financial manager here on the
mainland. I feel at ease entrusting the management of company
finances only to my wife," said Ho.</P>
      <P>For her part, Mrs. Ho said she had often worried about her
husband's daily life before she came to Shanghai two years ago. "Of
course, I worried that he might develop extramarital affairs," she
admitted frankly.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, two years after I have arrived here, I still
cannot find true ease because my teenage son remains in Taiwan. I
have frequently flown back to Taipei to see my son," she explained,
adding she is hopeful that the Taiwan-funded school now under
construction in Kunshan near Shanghai can be inaugurated soon so that
her son can move to the city and the family can finally be reunited.</P>
      <P>Ms. Chang came to the mainland three years ago for reunion with
her newly-wed husband, a senior manager with a Taiwan-financed firm
in Guangzhou in the southern mainland province of Guangdong.</P>
      <P>"But life here was too boring and monotonous. I had few friends.
I found it very difficulty to adapt myself to the mainland lifestyle.
At last, I found a way out -- I opened a fashion boutique on
Guangzhou's bustling Beijing Road," Ms. Chang recalled.</P>
      <P>And the boutique turned out to be a success. "It's a big surprise
to me. I didn't expect this bonanza in the first place. The shop now
earns more money than my husband's salary. And I'm planning to open a
second store here," an elated Chang said.</P>
      <P>Ms. Chang attributed her success partly to her resilience,
fortitude and perseverance. "Compared with their male counterparts,
Taiwan businesswomen can more easily win mainland people's support
and assistance," she observed.</P>
      <P>Despite her business success, Ms. Chang said she still feels
Taiwan women's lives in mainland China are not much fun. "At home,
they must be empathetic toward their husbands' emotions and the
pressures they face from their business operations. Outside, they
must work as hard as men while retaining their femininity," she
noted.</P>
      <P>The owner of a Taiwan-funded electronics company in Beijing, who
identified himself as "Old Chen," said he has become increasingly
fond of hiring female management staff from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"For one thing, I can save a big sum on `socializing' costs by
employing female managing executives. Mainland officials are less
likely to ask for entertainment at bars with hostess services when
our female managers play host to dinners or other public relations
programs," he said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Mr. Chen said, female executives are less likely to let
their personal love affairs or emotions affect their career lives.</P>
      <P>However, it remains a tall order for a Taiwan woman to carve out
a niche in the not-yet-fully-opened mainland market. Numerous
challenges and stumbling-blocks stand in the way.

      <P>"Many mainland people still have a hard time imagining that a
woman can be the chief executive officer of a business firm," said
Ms. Lee, who launched a venture in Shanghai three years ago.</P>
      <P>Ms. Lee recalled how she was mistaken as a secretary when she
made her first visit to a mainland company with a male staff member
to discuss a trade deal.</P>
      <P>Ms. Lee, who had had seven years of business experience in Taiwan
before relocating to the mainland, said that working in Shanghai, she
has inevitably felt pressure because of her gender.</P>
      <P>"I must endeavor to do everything well in order to win the
confidence and trust of my subordinates as well as my mainland
customers and partners," said the female executive, who was reluctant
to explain why she had chosen to launch her own venture on the
mainland, but apparently took pleasure in detailing her joys and
hardships in doing business there.</P>
      <P>Ms. Lee said that although female Taiwan migrants may have better
job promotion opportunities in mainland China than their peers back
in Taiwan, they should have the resolve and capability to adapt
themselves to lonely and dull lives as well as heavy work pressure
there.</P>
      <P>"I think that Taiwan women intending to pursue a career in
mainland China had better live here for sometime before making a
final decision on whether to leave their homeland," suggested Ms.
Lee.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ms. Lee said anyone who wants to succeed in mainland
China must avoid making any mistakes. "And the best way to avoid
making mistakes is to abide by the law and never opt for `backdoor'
or illicit methods," she stressed.</P>
      <P>Ms. Lee explained that although insisting on following legal ways
may exact higher operational costs in many cases, the practice can
help minimize legal risks. "By so doing, we can still speak loudly
once we encounter problems," she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO BREAKTHROUGH IN U.S.-CHINA IMPASSE EXPECTED BEFORE JIANG RETURNS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A political scholar from Taiwan said
Friday that there will not be any significant breakthroughs in the
U.S.-mainland China impasse over the collision of a U.S. Navy
surveillance plane and a Chinese jet fighter anytime before Jiang
Zemin returns to Beijing from his current visit to Latin America.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, former head of Taiwan's top mainland China policy
planning body, made the remark at a seminar on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations held Friday at Columbia University.</P>
      <P>The seminar, titled "Transformation from a One-Party
Dictatorship: The New Taiwan Government and Cross-Strait Relations,"
was jointly sponsored by the East Asian research institutes of
National Taiwan University and Columbia University.</P>
      <P>Besides Su, former Republic of China Legislator Hsieh Fu-sheng,
Professor Ger Yeong-kuang of National Taiwan University, Director Wu
Ruey-kuo of the Taiwan opposition People First Party's International
Affairs Department, and Professor Chou Yang-sun of the Chinese
Culture University were also present at the seminar.</P>
      <P>At the seminar, Su also described the Republic of China
government's mainland China policy since May 20, 2000, as "a half cup
of water."</P>
      <P>For those people who had worried about a strained cross-strait
relationship after the Democratic Progressive Party took power, the
past year has brought comfort because "there is still a half cup of
water," he said, adding that to those who had hoped the transfer of
power would bring about a rapprochement between the two sides of the
strait, the past year has been a disappointment for the very same
reason.</P>
      <P>Although he said he believes there won't be a significant
breakthrough in the U.S.-mainland China standoff prior to mainland
Chinese President Zemin's return to Beijing, he added that both sides
have shown restraint so far.</P>
      <P>Noting that U.S. President George W. Bush and Secretary of State
Colin Powell have both expressed regret over the incident and that
Beijing has welcomed the U.S. gesture, Su said he believes the
prospects of a solution to the impasse have improved, although
Beijing still insists on an U.S. apology for the incident.</P>
      <P>He added that he feels Washington and Beijing will not become
deadlocked over this issue and will be able to find a way to break
the impasse.</P>
      <P>Andrew Nathan, a political science professor at Columbia
University, who acted as a commentator at the seminar, said the
message revealed by Beijing in this incident is that if the U.S. side
still sells Taiwan the weapons it has requested, this will surely
anger Beijing and affect the triangular relationship between
Washington, Beijing, and Taipei.</P>
      <P>Nathan said he thinks the upcoming arms sales talks between
Taiwan and the United States scheduled for later in April is the
factor complicating the present U.S.-mainland China impasse.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Republic of China Representative to
Macau Tsai Jy-jon left for Macau Saturday to assume office.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who originally headed the Department of Hong Kong and
Macau Affairs under the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), said prior to his departure that he will do his utmost to
further strengthen the steadily growing Taiwan-Macau relations.</P>
      <P>Tsai took over the post of head of the Taipei Trade and
Tourism Office in Macau, which represents ROC interests in
the mainland China-ruled territory, from William W. Li in a
changeover ceremony held in Taipei Friday.</P>
      <P>This was the first high-profile personnel reshuffle since the
ROC representative office in Macau was inaugurated in December 1999.
Ending his Macau stint, Li has been appointed an MAC counselor.</P>
      <P>Li returned to Taipei Thursday evening for Friday's changeover
ceremony, which was chaired by MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tong.
Chen said the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, has conducted an overall review before making the personnel
reshuffle. Chen said the MAC will conduct another round of personnel
transfers in the future.</P>
      <P>Li's job relocation came as a surprise to his family. Li's wife,
Li-Ken Kuei-fang who is a member of the Taipei City Council, said
she feels that Li's departure from the Macau post was a loss to the
ROC.</P>
      <P>Reports from Macau also said that many Macau people were
surprised by the abrupt change of the leadership at Taiwan's
representative office in Macau. Nevertheless, most of them do not
think that the personnel reshuffle will affect Taiwan-Macau
exchanges.</P>
      <P>An influential Macau resident who had often helped Li forge
contacts and connections with Macau celebrities was quoted as saying
that Li's successor, Tsai Jy-jon, also has extensive connections in
Macau.</P>
      <P>"Tsai is no stranger to Macau affairs. He has extensive
connections. I believe that the communication channels between
Taiwan's representative office and the Macau government will remain
open and continue to function well," he said.</P>
      <P>The staff of the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in Macau also
said the latest personnel transfer will not have any adverse impact
on the office's operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official with mainland China's liaison office
in Macau was quoted as saying that so long as Taiwan's
representative office abides by the "seven principles" outlined
by mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen, its relations with
Macau will not be affected simply because of the personnel
reshuffle.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said Saturday it has again lodged a protest against Japan for
adopting a middle school history textbook that includes whitewashed
accounts of the Japanese invasion of China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in a press release that it ordered the
Republic of China representative office in Tokyo Saturday to convey
the protest to the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>It was the third time that the MOFA has expressed "concern" and
"regret" over the issue to the Japanese government since February
when Japan decided to use the textbook.</P>
      <P>"History must not be distorted or tampered," the MOFA said in
its press statement, adding it hopes that the Japanese government
will quickly correct all whitewashed accounts in its newly compiled
textbook which will be used from April 2002.</P>
      <P>Written by right-wing academics, the contents of the textbook
underwent some revisions after South Korea and mainland China also
denounced Japan's decision to adopt it.</P>
      <P>However, the revised textbook still contains passages justifying
Japan's colonial past while excluding or minimizing its atrocities.
It was once again approved for inclusion in Japan's middle school
curriculum in a decision announced earlier this week..</P>
      <P>The MOFA said Japan's unrepentant attitude toward its wartime
atrocities has hurt the feelings of the people of Taiwan and
other neighboring Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The ministry added it will continue pushing Japan to rectify its
textbook's content so as to avoid adverse repercussions on bilateral
relations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a group of lawmakers, writers and history scholars
called a joint press conference Saturday, condemning Japan's attempt
to tamper with history.</P>
      <P>They said Japan should immediately rectify its textbook's
whitewashed accounts of Japan's invasion of China and its wartime
atrocities, including forcing Taiwan and other Asian women into

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTORS IN M'LAND HAVE SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen who have traveled to
the mainland amid "westward fever" over the past decade must have a
spirit of adventure in their veins.</P>
      <P>After all, Taiwan firms on the mainland, estimated to be at least
40,000 by the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's State Council,
have no reliable information to use as an investment guide, and
information in the mainland is still not particularly transparent.</P>
      <P>Maybe the only thing they can be sure of is that politics is
off-limits, especially after the latest incident involving Taiwan
business tycoon Shi Wen-lung.</P>
      <P>Recent media had reported that Shi's Chi Mei petrochemical plant
in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province, had been forced to shut down under
pressure from Beijing, which has voiced strong dissatisfaction about
Shi's comments quoted in a comic book by Japanese comic book writer
Yoshinori Kobayashi that Taiwanese women joined the Japanese
military brothels "voluntarily" during World War II. The reports of
the factory's closure were later proven false.</P>
      <P>Shi has in the past raised the ire of Beijing because of his
support of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which has
advocated Taiwan independence in the past.</P>
      <P>Li Bingcai, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under
Beijing's State Council, has openly said several times that the
mainland would oppose Taiwanese who reap economic profits in the
mainland while supporting the Taiwan independence movement.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen are betting that although Beijing would
probably not use its political clout to force Taiwanese it deems
politically questionable to close their plants, authorities there
certainly could use administrative measures to disrupt their
operations.</P>
      <P>Susan Chen, chief operating officer of Netease, a major mainland
Internet portal, said that as Taiwanese have traveled to the mainland
to conduct business, they should definitely refrain from politics.
Chen is believed to be the highest-level Taiwanese woman serving in
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Taiwan businessmen have made up their decision to go
to the mainland for two reasons. One is that the mainland has become
a center of worldwide manufacturing with its cheap and young labor
force. This is forcing many traditional businesses in Taiwan to
invest in the mainland in order to maintain their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The second reason is the vast potential domestic market in the
mainland, which boasts a population of 1.3 billion.</P>
      <P>The Economic Bureau under the Taiwan Affairs Office of State
Council said that at least 40,000 Taiwan businesses have invested
a combined total of around US$40 billion in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Among the 40,000 Taiwanese firms, about 10,000 are located in the
southeastern coastal province of Guangdong. The most dense area is in
Donguan, with 3,800 Taiwan businesses.</P>
      <P>In terms of industries and markets, export-oriented Taiwan
manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry, Acer, and Lite-On
Technology have mostly set up plants in Donguan, Shenzhen, Shanghai,
and Suzhou. These locations provide not only cheap labor but also
proximity to international harbors at Hong Kong and Shanghai, which
facilitate exporting.</P>
      <P>But mainland-oriented Taiwan manufacturers and distributors, such
as rice cracker manufacturer Want Want and electronics products
maker Tsann Kuen Enterprises, have mostly chosen Guangzhou, Shenzhen,
Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing and Wuhan, in order to take advantage of
the huge populations of these cities, all of which contain at least
six million consumers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwanese traditional manufacturers with capital of
less than US$10 million have mostly converged on densely populated
areas like Donguan, Xiamen, Ningpo, Fuzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu,
Shanghai, and Shenzhen. An estimated 70 percent of Taiwanese
companies on the mainland fall into this category.</P>
      <P>During the early stage of economic reforms in the early 1990s,
around 70 percent of Taiwanese businessmen in the mainland
encountered problems related to their personal safety, making
security their major concern.</P>
      <P>But with the changing investment environment and preparation for
WTO entry, the mainland has begun to constrain its trade and economic
policies, which had been more generous and set fewer restrictions in
the past in order to entice foreign investment. For example, the
mainland used to allow wholly-owned overseas companies to be in the
service sector, but later changed this policy to allow only joint
ventures to engage in service industries.</P>
      <P>The major issue facing Taiwan businessmen has thus shifted from
personal safety to how to run a viable buSINESS.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Export-oriented Taiwanese manufacturers in the mainland have
encountered major problems related to its unreasonable customs
regulations. It is known that at least 30 Taiwan businessmen and
executives in Guangdong province alone have been arrested on charges
of smuggling.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen also face demands of heavy additional "fees"
imposed by local authorities. A conservative estimate put these
payments at about double the amount of the taxes paid to the central
government. Local authorities also think of numerous ways to collect
money, and as Taiwanese executives have to rely on the cooperation of
local officials, they usually have to comply with these requests.</P>
      <P>Taiwan manufacturers there also face a steep tax of around 40
percent if they decide to sell their products in the mainland instead
of exporting them abroad, which hinders their ability to compete in
the mainland market.</P>
      <P>As the mainland imposes strict foreign exchange control measures,
hindering the inflow and outflow of foreign exchange, Taiwan
businessmen suffer from exchange rate losses and remittance
processing fees. Taiwan businessmen also cannot get loans from
mainland banks.</P>
      <P>Mainland China also sets strict restrictions on the kinds of
investment allowed, such as cell phone manufacturing, and goes so far
as to ban certain types.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan businessmen in mainland-oriented manufacturing or
distribution, there are also many issues that await resolution.
Regulations regarding selling in the mainland are chaotic, with too
many restrictions placed on investments in service industries. Even
if the mainland joins the World Trade Organization, it is expected
that the situation will not be improved for at least another five
years.</P>
      <P>Moreover, many Taiwanese manufacturers in the mainland are
operating at relatively low technology levels, making it easier for
mainland people to copy their businesses and become their rivals.</P>
      <P>The mainland China also sets high capital requirements in the
insurance and banking and trading sectors, effectively shutting out
Taiwan businessmen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT INTERVIEWED FOR SECRET CONTACTS WITH BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   8  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui was
interviewed April 3 by members of the Control Yuan over his decision
to contact Beijing secretly through his confidants during his tenure
as head of state.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that the head of the Republic of China has
ever been interviewed by the nation's supreme watchdog, said the
China Times, which published the story on its front page Sunday.</P>
      <P>With full respect for the former ROC president, Lee was
interviewed at his Taipei residence by three Control Yuan members
charged with the investigation, instead of being summoned to the
Control Yuan for questioning as is usual under the law.</P>
      <P>Lee was quoted as saying that he was approached by Beijing
authorities in the early 1990s shortly after he had assumed the
presidency and that he responded to Beijing's offer for secret
meetings by sending his personal secretary Su Chih-cheng to make
contact with messengers from Beijing in Hong Kong with the purpose of
giving momentum to the cross-strait relationship, which had become
stagnate by that time.</P>
      <P>He said Su met with Beijing's point man in his capacity as the
personal representative of the ROC president and later reported to
Lee the contents of the discussion. Lee noted that Su never divulged
any state secrets nor compromised the island's security in any way
during his meetings with his Beijing counterparts.</P>
      <P>Before calling on Lee, the three-member panel from the Control
Yuan, with Lee Shen-yi as its head, had already interviewed Su and
Cheng Shu-min, one of Lee Teng-hui's cronies who accompanied Su on
many of the secret missions.</P>
      <P>The panel had also consulted Ting Yu-chou, director of the
National Security Bureau before talking with Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>The China Times quoted Lee Shen-yi as saying that his panel is
inclined to clear Lee Teng-hui of any charges of irregularities in
connection with his secret contacts with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The incident came to light last July after an man who claimed to
have brokered the first secret meeting came clean to a local news
weekly on his role as a go-between for such contacts.</P>
      <P>Lee Teng-hui's critics at the Legislative Yuan immediately asked
the Control Yuan to look into the revelation, claiming that the
former president had violated existing laws which prohibited senior
government officials from visiting mainland China and that Su might
have betrayed national secrets during his talks with Beijing
emissaries.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will take pains to
scuttle five bills pending in the Legislative Yuan which will tax the
government's coffers, said Lin Chuan, director-general of the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics under the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>In an interview published by the China Times on Sunday, Lin
branded the five legislator-initiated bills as pork barrel politics,
saying they are controversial, unfair and deviating from social
justice because they are aimed at benefiting constituents of
legislators who face elections at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>He warned the five bills will cost the government about an extra
NT$5 trillion (US$153.84 billion), which he said will only worsen the
government's already tight budget situation.</P>
      <P>The bills the Executive Yuan is aiming to sink include one to
compensate government employees who retired after 1970, one to dredge
the Keelung River, a bill to compensate landlords whose land was
appropriated for roads, an anti-cancer bill which will require the
government to earmark NT$2 billion (US$62.5 million) per year for the
prevention and treatment of cancer, and a bill to offer pensions to
veterans of the mainland Chinese shelling of Kinmen on Aug. 23, 1958.</P>
      <P>He blamed legislators for initiating bills aimed at winning the
hearts of their constituents with an eye on the scheduled year-end
elections.</P>
      <P>As a result, Lin said, the capital outlay is accounting for an
ever-shrinking share of the government's budget which will inevitably
damage the country's economy and competitiveness in the long term.</P>
      <P>Lin warned that the country's finances could collapse if the five
bills in their present form are approved by the Legislative Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WTO ENTRY'S NEGATIVE IMPACT ON AGRI-SECTOR SAID UNDERESTIMATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The impact of Taiwan's entry into the World
Trade Organization on the island's agricultural sector will be far
more serious than originally estimated, the nation's top agricultural
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsi-huang, chairman of the Council of Agriculture (COA),
said Taiwan's bid to enter the WTO will lower the value of the
island's agricultural production, with losses due to WTO entry
surpassing the original estimate of NT$50 billion (US$1.51 billion).</P>
      <P>Chen said that "the actual number will probably go beyond" the
original estimate, and that if the situation goes on, Taiwan's
agricultural sector could face unprecedented challenges in four or
five years time.</P>
      <P>The COA, in anticipation of the nation's entry into the world
trade regulatory body, has mapped out a strategy and an assessment of
the overall impact and also the impact on individual industries. It
recently revised these assessments again.</P>
      <P>Chen also estimated that within four years of Taiwan's WTO entry,
at least 100,000 people in the agricultural sector will have to shift
to other forms of employment, stressing that agricultural sector
workers having to shift to new jobs has occurred in Taiwan in the
past without posing too many problems.</P>
      <P>But he did say he still has some concerns about the joblessness
that will occur in the agriculture sector, saying he laments the fact
that this sector's role of releasing workers for or absorbing workers
from traditional industries has disappeared with the transformation
of Taiwan's social and agricultural structure.</P>
      <P>As a result, he said, with the present sluggish economic
situation, those who now lose their jobs in tradition industries will
not be able to shift to agriculture which, along with the estimated
20,000 to 30,000 who are expected to lose their jobs in the
agricultural sector with Taiwan's WTO entry, will result in more
alarming jobless rates</P>
      <P>Chen said that he has observed that Taiwan's economy has entered
into a very dangerous situation and that if no "high doses of
medicine are administered" and if no drastic measures are applied,
then the economy will likely fall into a quandary that will not be
able to be reversed.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks followed a meeting convened by President Chen
Shui-bian Saturday during which he invited financial and economic
leaders to discuss the current economic situation and national
economic development directions and policy. Those attending also
discussed Taiwan's financial sector, foreign laborers, and the
expected increased jobless rate after WTO entry.</P>
      <P>The COA was also invited to attend the meeting to present its
ideas on Taiwan's economy and agricultural sector.</P>

      <P>The knowledge economy program laid
down by the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) will
make Taiwan a fully-developed country within ten years, said CEPD
head Lin Po-chih in Los Angeles Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a speech at a Taiwan-United States forum on science, Lin said
the program launched in January is aimed at tapping the experience

States for the economic development of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan businesspeople have invested more than US$100
billion in mainland China, Southeast Asia and other places around the
world, Lin said Taiwan authorities are working hard to make a network
out of these Taiwan businesspeople's production points and to harness
it with international capital to develop a knowledge economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's efforts to make the island a global logistic center is

    <DATELINE>Chiayi County, April 8 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dalai Lama on Sunday praised the
contributions Buddhist Master Cheng Yen has made to society through
her compassion, mercy and fearless care for the needy.</P>
      <P>The Tibetan leader made the remarks while meeting with one of
Taiwan's Buddhist leaders, Master Cheng Yen, who is also founder of
the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, in a hospital
patronized by the foundation in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More than 100 Tzu Chi Foundation volunteers, doctors and nurses
of the hospital, excited by having the chance to meet simultaneously
the two religious leaders, rushed to welcome the Dalai Lama and
Master Cheng Yen in the lobby of the hospital.</P>
      <P>Some people said emotionally that they felt very fortunate to
have the opportunity to meet the two Buddhist leaders at the same
time.</P>
      <P>After hearing a report made by the hospital's president about the
work done by the hospital and the Tzu Chi Foundation, the Dalai Lama
said he saw the mercy in all the work done by the foundation.</P>
      <P>He added that he had always thought Catholicism had made more of
a contribution to Taiwan society than Buddhism, saying he has a new
outlook after finding out about the work of the Tzu Chi Foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation, which takes charity, medicine, education, and
culture as its four main missions, extends love and substantial
assistance to wherever it is needed through its hundreds of thousands
of volunteers scattered around the world.</P>
      <P>Although obtaining handsome financial support from all walks of
life, the prestigious nun and her followers still earn money cent by
cent, making hand-made craft products such as candles and baby shoes
to maintain their living.</P>
      <P>Now Tzu Chi has branches all over Taiwan and has opened liaison
offices in more than 20 countries and areas around the world.</P>
      <P>Master Cheng Yen told the Dalai Lama that she began her charity
work by offering financial support to the poor but later found the
poor and the sick are always linked closely, so she said she later
had the idea of establishing hospitals for the poor and needy.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama noted that Tzu Chi has made contributions that go
beyond religion, race and national borders, saying he is happy to see
the mercy which Tzu Chi shows through its charitable work. The
Tibetan leader also praised the efforts Tzu Chi has made towards
environmental protection, which he said is an area few people pay
attention to.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama arrived in Taipei March 31 for a 10-day "religious
trip" at the invitation of the Chinese Buddhist Association.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONGRESSMAN WARNS BEIJING AGAINST REFUSING TO RETURN CREW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  7  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Henry Hyde (R-Il), head of the U. S.
House International Relations Committee, warned Beijing Saturday that
the crisis will intensify if it refuses to return the 24-member crew
of the U.S. surveillance plane that collided with a mainland Chinese
jetfighter.</P>
      <P>Commenting during a CNN talk show, Hyde said that "if we get into
the middle of next week and the personnel are still being held, the
intensity of this and the danger escalates."</P>
      <P>Hyde was referring to the collision that occurred a week ago over
the South China Sea that forced a U.S. Navy aircraft to make an
emergency landing on Hainan Island. The plane and its crew are now
being held by mainland Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>He claimed that "I don't think expressing regret over the death
of the pilot, the Chinese pilot, shows weakness. It shows humanity. I
think we have many ways of showing that we're not weak. One of them
is the weapons that we are going to provide Taiwan with in a couple
of weeks. They don't want the Aegis system sold and other weapons. We
can do that."</P>
      <P>"We can slow down the process whereby China wants to be admitted
to the World Trade Organization. China wants the Olympic Games in
2008. There are resolutions in Congress objecting to that. There are
lots of things we can do if we are driven to do them. I just think
that China ought to calm down and end this," Hyde added.</P>
      <P>"I think our responsibility under the Taiwan Relations Act is to
provide Taiwan with adequate and appropriate assets to defend itself
against a possible attack from mainland China. And that obligation
persists, whether or not our 24 crewmen get returned or not. I think
that decision should be made independently of what is going on in
Hainan right now," the congressmen pointed out.</P>
      <P>When asked whether the decision should be positive as far as
selling the Aegis destroyers to Taiwan, Hyde replied that "I do, but
I would leave that to the technical people. And I don't think what's
going on in Hainan right now is very encouraging in terms of
discouraging us from selling them the more sensitive equipment."</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of whether he will oppose the United
States maintaining permanent normal trade relations status for
mainland China if Beijing fails to meet the requirements for entrance
into the World Trade Organization this year, Hyde said his
inclination is to oppose it now.</P>
      <P>"I have supported it in the past, in the expectation that China
would reduce its human rights abuses and that things would improve. I
don't see that happening at all. On the contrary, I see them
exacerbated. Therefore, I would need some persuasive arguments to
move me to support again most-favored-nation status for China.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Sunday that a heart full of pleasure is the best medicine

      <P>Chen made the remarks while attending the inauguration of
Taiwan's Anti-Cancer Federation on Sunday.</P>
      <P>He called on the public to love life, exercise, and eat five
kinds of fruit and vegetables every day to guard against cancer.</P>
      <P>Seventeen local anti-cancer groups on Sunday launched an
anti-cancer rally at the plaza in front of the Taipei City Government

      <P>Rally activities included free checkups and the providing of free
anti-cancer information. More than 1,000 citizens participated in the
rally.</P>
      <P>Cancer has been among the top ten killers in Taiwan for each of
the past 19 years. In order to provide local people with anti-cancer
information, 17 local anti-cancer groups, including the Taiwan Cancer

    <HEADLINE>PROFITABILITY OF STATE-OWNED FIRMS QUESTIONED ON EVE OF BUDGET REVIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator from the opposition New Party
(NP) pointed out Sunday that the overall profit rate of state-owned
enterprises has dropped sharply over the years.</P>
      <P>NP Legislator Lai Shyh-bao made the remarks on the eve of the
review of the budget of state-owned enterprises for this fiscal year
by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lai said that state-owned enterprises have accumulated unpaid
debts of nearly NT$700 billion (US$21.27 billion) and that their
operational losses have surpassed NT$100 billion (US$ 3.04 billion).
Of the 36 state-owned enterprises, 19 recorded a profitability of
less than five percent.</P>
      <P>Lai said that state-owned enterprises used to be a major source
of government funds but have turned from a cash cow to a money pit in
recent years, with more than 90 percent of them actually becoming a
drain on government coffers. He added that the government needs to
address the problem.</P>
      <P>Lai urged the ruling party not to set its eyes only on the
"lucrative" state-owned enterprises, but to also take on the
debt-ridden state-owned enterprises, such as Taiwan Chung Hsing Paper
Corp., Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corp. and China Shipbuilding
Corp., to display its management abilities. Elections of the board
directors and supervisors for these enterprises should also be made
more transparent, Lai added.</P>
      <P>He noted that the unpaid debts of the 36 state-owned enterprises
have run up to NT$687.7 billion so far this year, noting that this
is up NT$113.2 billion over that of the end of last year. Among
the 36 enterprises, more than one third have suffered from long-term
losses.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that the profits of state-owned enterprises
have continued to slip, with the accumulated profits dropping to
NT$208.6 billion this year from NT$325.4 billion last year and
falling to 7.49 percent of total government revenues from 11.1
percent in 1995.</P>
      <P>Moreover, most of those profits, or 79 percent of the total, have
come from the mostly monopoly state-owned enterprises such as the
Central Bank of China, Bank of Taiwan, Taiwan Power Co. and Chung Hwa
Telecom, showing that the rest of the state-owned businesses have
been incapable of replenishing government coffers.</P>
      <P>He also noted that total expenditures by state-owned enterprises
are forecast to be NT$2,530 billion in the new fiscal year, saying he
intends to slash about NT$143.2 billion, or 5.6 percent, from that
bloated figure.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that public relations and advertising fees have
become bloated and that personnel costs should also be slashed.</P>
      <P>Lai also questioned the budget presented by Taipower concerning
the fourth nuclear power plant, saying that the budget states NT$3.5
billion (US$106.38 million) was lost during the almost four-month
plant construction hiatus but that the budget has ballooned to
NT$208.3 billion from the original estimate of NT$169.7 billion.</P>
      <P>Lai pointed out that Taipower has failed to explain why it needs
to increase the budget by NT$38.6 billion, saying he will rigorously
review the budget.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DALAI LAMA ENDS 10-DAY VISIT IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the
Dalai Lama departed from Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung
Monday for India after concluding his 10-day visit in Taiwan, the
second of its kind since March 1997.</P>
      <P>In a brief interview with reporters before boarding his early
morning flight, the Dalai Lama described the past 10 days in Taiwan
as a happy journey.</P>
      <P>He said he found that Taiwan is a genuinely free and democratic
society where not only politicians, but businesspeople and citizens
of all walks of life truthfully voice their ideas and feelings about
both "good and bad things."</P>
      <P>The Tibetan god king, however, reminded people in Taiwan that
whenever they state their views, their words should not run counter
to their "moral obligations."</P>
      <P>During his high-profile stay, the Dalai Lama preached the
teachings of the Buddha at a two-day ceremony, which also featured an
empowerment blessing ritual.</P>
      <P>More than 20,000 people attended the ceremony, during which the
Dalai Lama stressed the importance of cultivating an "awakened mind,"
describing this as a way of gaining happiness and parting with pain.</P>
      <P>Although his trip was labeled as "strictly religious in nature,"
the Dalai Lama met with many political figures in Taiwan during his
visit.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama met with President Chen Shui-bian, Vice President
Annette Lu, former President Lee Teng-hui, and chairmen of Taiwan's
opposition Kuomintang and People First Party for discussions on a
wide range of topics.</P>
      <P>He told President Chen that he is looking forward to having
Tibetan students come to Taiwan to study Mandarin Chinese and to
translate Tibetan Buddhist works into the language.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama donated US$15,000 to the Taiwan public to help
with reconstruction work in the area of central Taiwan that was
ravaged by a devastating earthquake in September 1999.</P>
      <P>He also met with prominent religious leaders in Taiwan, including
Master Cheng Yen, founder of the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu
Chi Foundation; Master Sheng Yen, founder of the Buddhist group
Dharma Drum Mountain; and Dharma Master Hsin Tao, founder of the Ling
Jiou Mountain Buddhist Foundation and the Museum of World Religions.</P>
      <P>Unexpectedly and pleasantly, the Dalai Lama received from the
Central News Agency a set of file photos that included pictures of
himself and the Tibetan people over the past sixty years. One of the
pictures contained within the set shows the infant Dalai Lama in the
arms of his mother along with his father and elder brother.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN CALLS FOR DELINKING OF 'COLLISION' AND ARMS SALES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday he
earnestly hopes that the current U.S.-mainland China standoff over
the military aircraft collision incident will not have any adverse
impact on the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with visiting U.S. Senator
John D. Rockefeller (D-W.Va) at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>"We are concerned about the 'collision' incident and are hopeful
that the weeklong Washington-Beijing standoff over this matter can
come to a close very soon," Chen told his guest.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that President Chen has publicly touched
on the issue regarding a midair collision between a U.S. EP-3
surveillance plane and a mainland Chinese jet fighter over South
China Sea April 1.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his hopes that the U.S. government can use wisdom
to resolve the issue peacefully through diplomatic channels in the
shortest possible period of time.</P>
      <P>As the Republic of China and the United States are scheduled to
discuss Taiwan's arms procurement plans for 2001 later this month,
President Chen said he looks forward to see delinking of the
"collision" incident and ROC-U.S. arms deals.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that although Washington and Beijing have
engaged in close exchanges over a long period of time and have taken
some confidence-building measures (CBM), the military aircraft
collision incident still took place.</P>
      <P>"The event has given us a great lesson. As the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait has not forged any CBM, the consequences could be
very grave if such a similar incident were to happen in the Taiwan
Strait," Chen said, adding that he sees an urgent need for Taiwan
and mainland China to craft out a CBM mechanism.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he is very happy to see Rockefeller visit
Taiwan again. He also expressed gratitude for Rockefeller's
contribution to peace and security in the Taiwan Strait on behalf of
the ROC government and people.</P>
      <P>Noting that Rockefeller has often stood up for Taiwan's national
cause at critical moments, Chen said the ROC government and people
are grateful for the U.S. senator's contribution to Taiwan Strait
peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is hopeful that Rockefeller can continue supporting
the ROC's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) as an
observer.</P>
      <P>"When the WHO holds its annual congress in Geneva later this
year, U.S. Congress members can exercise their clout to push other
WHO member states to support our observer status bid," Chen said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Rockefeller said he is also worrying about
possible adverse effects of the ongoing U.S.-mainland China standoff
over the "collision" incident on Taiwan-U.S. arms deals.</P>
      <P>Rockefeller said he has expressed his concern to the U.S.
executive branch and urged the Bush administration not to link
arms sales consideration to the "collision" incident.</P>
      <P>The senator further said he is willing to play an intermediary
role between the United States and the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait and work for the development of constructive
Taiwan-U.S.-mainland China relations.</P>
      <P>Also present at the meeting were Raymond Burghardt, head of the
Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan, which represents
U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties,
and ROC Vice Foreign Minister Wu Tzu-dan.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and

tourism industry is now facing the problem of unbalanced development.</P>
      <P>Noting that the number of Taiwan tourists visiting abroad is more

economic development.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, Taiwan has focused almost exclusively on
the development of sightseeing areas, while neglecting the potential
of the island's rich culture and natural beauty in attracting foreign
tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC VICE PRESIDENT PASSES AWAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  9  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China Vice President
Shieh Tung-min passed away Sunday night at his home in a suburb of
Taipei from cardial infarction. He was 95.</P>
      <P>Shieh was sent to Veterans General Hospital this past Chinese New
Year Eve, which fell on Jan. 23, because of a mild cardial infarction
and upper respiratory tract infection. His condition had fluctuated
between good or bad, but he lapsed into coma and his heart stopped
beating after congenic shock Sunday. His condition then steadily
worsened despite emergency treatment.</P>
      <P>After communicating with the hospital, Shieh's family decided to
check him out voluntarily and return him home as is the custom of
most Chinese. He passed away peacefully, surrounded by his family
members and monks who recited Buddhist scriptures at his bedside.</P>
      <P>Doctors at Veterans General Hospital said that Shieh used to
suffer from high blood pressure, diabetes, gout and mild renal
insufficiency.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, Vice President Annette Lu, opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, and other KMT leaders all paid their
respects to Hsieh's family after hearing the news.</P>
      <P>The president and vice president lauded Shieh as the embodiment
figure in Taiwan's construction history and said that his
contributions would remain in the hearts of the people of Taiwan.
They especially noted that during his tenure as the Taiwan provincial
governor, he advocated cottage industries, supported the domestic
processing of agricultural products, took care of low-income
families, and cracked down on superstitious beliefs.</P>
      <P>Shieh, who was the first Taiwanese to serve as Taiwan provincial
governor and vice president, played a major role in Taiwan's modern
history. He was born Jan. 25, 1907, in Changhua, central Taiwan. He
went to the mainland to study in his youth because Taiwan was still
under Japanese colonial rule at the time. He only returned to Taiwan
after the island returned to the fold of its motherland in 1945.</P>
      <P>Mild, graceful and unassuming, he had served at different times
as Kaohsiung county magistrate, director of the Department of Civil
Affairs, and speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly. The time he
served in the Taiwan Provincial Assembly was a major factor in
catapulting him into a career in politics.</P>
      <P>Shieh was assigned to serve as Taiwan provincial governor in 1972
by then Premier Chiang Ching-kuo, thereby becoming Taiwan's first
civilian governor. Before him, all Taiwan provincial governors had
come from military backgrounds.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan provincial governor, he advocated the development of
grass-roots level politics. In order to listen to the voice of the
people at the grass-roots level, he would often make sudden visits to
local places, heading to almost every small town and village in
Taiwan at one time or another during his six-year tenure.</P>
      <P>A package bomb sent to his office Oct. 10, 1966, blew up,
breaking his left hand and injuring his right hand. The man who sent
the bomb to highlight the cause of Taiwan independence was Wang
Sing-nan, presently a legislator from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Considered as one of the elites of Taiwan, he assumed the
position of vice president in 1978 to help then President Chiang
Ching-kuo. After stepping down from that post in 1984, he continued
to command respect from within the then ruling Kuomintang. Shieh was
one of the KMT heavyweights who often helped coordinate the fierce
intraparty strife over different policy lines and ideals during
President Lee Teng-hui's reign as the party chairman.</P>
      <P>Shieh's son, Shieh Mung-shiung, and daughter-in-law, Helen Lin
(Lin Chen-chi), are now also active in politics, with the former
serving as a member of the Control Yuan, the nation's highest
watchdog body, and the latter serving as the first female vice
chairman of the KMT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER WARNS OF POSSIBLE LAYOFFS, PAY-CUTS, CLOSURES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi
called for debt-ridden state-owned enterprises to accelerate the
rejuvenation of their operations and structures in order to survive
competition.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise," Lin noted, "I do not exclude the possibility that
they may face possible layoffs, salary cuts and even closures as a
result of their business failures."</P>
      <P>The economics minister made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan
at a Budget and Final Accounts Committee hearing, where legislators
reviewed the budget of state-owned enterprises for this fiscal year.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lin, who is chairman of the Commission of National
Corporations (CNC), CNC Vice Chairman Lin Wen-yuan and chairmen and
executive directors of the 12 state-run enterprises under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) were also present at the budget
review session.</P>
      <P>In response to criticism lodged by New Party Legislator Lai
Shyh-bao Sunday that 90 percent of state-run enterprises have become
a drain on government coffers, CNC Vice Chairman Lin Wen-yuan said
most of the 36 state-owned enterprises have begun their respective
rejuvenation plans.</P>
      <P>For example, he noted, staff and employees of China Shipbuilding
Corp. (CSBC) have agreed to have their salaries cut and also to have
some workers laid off, while Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corp.
(TMMC) has agreed to be merged with money-making China Steel Corp.
Under the merger plan, China Steel Corp. will take in some 170 TMMC
employees, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>He said personnel salaries and payments are the major cost of
every state-owned business in Taiwan, noting that CSBC spends twice
as much in this area than its privately-run counterparts and eight to
10 times more than its mainland Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>Lowering personnel costs is the first step for CSBC in sharpening
its competitive edge, he noted.</P>
      <P>In a budget review meeting held Sunday, New Party Legislator Lai
Shyh-bao said state-owned enterprises used to be a major source of
government funds but have turned from a cash cow to a money pit in
recent years.</P>
      <P>Lai said that state-owned enterprises have accumulated unpaid
debts of nearly NT$700 billion (US$21.27 billion) and that their
operational losses have surpassed NT$100 billion (US$3.04 billion).
Of Taiwan's 36 state-owned firms, 19 recorded a profitability of less
than 5 percent, he added.</P>

      <P>A privately owned ship made a direct voyage

southeastern mainland Chinese port city of Xiamen Monday, marking yet
another step forward in the "mini three links" program.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that a private boat had been allowed to
sail directly to Xiamen since Taiwan opened direct trade, mail and
shipping links between its two offshore defense outposts of Kinmen
and Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei in Fujian Province --
commonly known as the "mini three links" -- at the beginning of this
year.</P>
      <P>The 3,500-ton Kinmen Marine Transport Co.-owned ship carried 295
Kinmen residents to Xiamen for a five-day package tour, which also
includes paying respects to their ancestors.</P>
      <P>Since Jan. 1, Kinmen county government-run ferry boats have made
10 direct voyages to Xiamen. Lin Chen-cha, director of the county
government's Tourism Bureau, said he is very pleased to see a private
shipping firm join the direct Kinmen-Xiamen shipping service.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the move will help turn a new page for the
development of the `mini three links' program," Lin said.</P>
      <P>As mainland China has been reluctant to take active steps to
facilitate the Taiwan-initiated program, most local private shipping
firms have stayed on the sidelines and have not entered the market.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Marine Transport Co. Chairman Yang Su-yuan said many
obstacles still stand in the way of direct Kinmen-Xiamen shipping
services. For one thing, he said, mainland China has not yet given
the green light to regular direct shipping services and has instead
approved relevant applications on a case-by-case basis only.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yang said, current ROC regulations demand that all
Xiamen-bound visitors abide by the principle of "group in, group
out," while Kinmen is still banned from acting as a "transit center"
for indirect transport services between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"These restrictions have discouraged private ship owners from
edging into the Kinmen-Xiamen direct shipping market," Yang
explained, adding he hopes that Taiwan and the mainland can sit down
to hammer out a mechanism to let the "mini three links" program
really take off.</P>
      <P>Even though mainland China approved the privately owned ship's
direct voyage to Xiamen, it rejected entry permit applications from
two of those who had hoped to make the trip.</P>
      <P>The two prospective visitors were Kinmen County Councilor Chen
Shui-su and Chen Chang-chiang, a commissioner of the ROC's Fukien
Provincial Government Commission, which oversees civilian affairs
administration on Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Chen Chang-chiang said he believed mainland China rejected his
visit mainly because he is a member of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party, also the ROC's current ruling party.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kinmen County Councilor Chen Shui-su said he had no
idea why his application had been denied, as he had already made a
direct voyage to Xiamen along with a county council delegation early
this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) unveiled Monday a package of regulations governing work permit
applications by mainland Chinese spouses of Republic of China
citizens.</P>
      <P>A CLA spokesman said the council formulated the package based on
a revised bill to the existing statute governing relations between
the people of Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The revision, promulgated by the Executive Yuan Feb. 20, allows
mainland spouses of local citizens to work in Taiwan under certain
conditions. In the past, mainland spouses were completely banned from
taking jobs here.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the CLA will begin to accept work permit
applications by mainland spouses from Wednesday, as long as the
applicants have legal residency status.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the applicants must produce official documents proving
that their Taiwan spouses come from low-income families, are aged 65
or older, are mentally or physically disabled, or are suffering from
serious diseases or injuries.</P>
      <P>The CLA unveiled the new regulations after opposition lawmakers
recently criticized a continued police crackdown on employed mainland
spouses, even after the Cabinet promulgated the revised bill.</P>
      <P>Opposition New Party Legislator Lai Shyh-bao quoted Bureau of
Immigration statistics as showing that from Jan. 1 to March 19, 346
mainland spouses were expelled for working illegally in Taiwan. Among

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) will
not follow Japan in adopting a zero interest rate, but it will adopt
a more relaxed currency policy since domestic prices are stable and
domestic demand has yet to fully recover, CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Perng made the remarks as he fielded questions in the Legislative
Yuan, where the committees were reviewing the part of the CBC budget
under the overall review of the central government budget.</P>
      <P>Legislators Lin Wen-lang and Chien Hsi-chieh expressed concern
about the slowdown in the economy and expressed the hope that the CBC
will adopt substantial measures to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>Perng noted that the CBC has cut interest rates four times since
the end of last year to stimulate the economy, but he said that it
may take some time to see the effects of the moves.</P>
      <P>The depreciation of the new Taiwan dollar was also a focus of
concern among the legislators.</P>
      <P>Perng said that with the fluctuation of the global financial
situation, the exchange rate should be kept flexible to avoid the
risk of being ambushed by speculators.</P>
      <P>He also said that the CBC will let the exchange rate of the new
Taiwan dollar be decided by market demand and that the CBC will only
intervene when there are seasonal, occasional or erratic factors.</P>
      <P>Perng said that there are three favorable factors that will help
stabilize the local currency -- the balance of payments is good;
foreign currency deposits in the private sector amount to between
US$34 billion and US$35 billion; and importers have made big
purchases of U.S. dollars in anticipation of the depreciation of the
new Taiwan dollar, while local demand for foreign currency is not
strong at present.</P>
      <P>Perng also dismissed fears that the CBC's plan to issue NT$2,000

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE PROSECUTION DROPS CHARGES AGAINST CAL STAFF OVER 1994 CRASH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, April 9 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japanese prosecutors have once again decided
to drop criminal charges against four Japan-based staff members of
Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) over a 1994 plane crash at Nagoya
airport in central Japan, sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the Nagoya District Prosecutor's Office
has informed relatives of Japanese victims of the crash of a CAL
Airbus A-320 of its decision to stop its probe into alleged
malfeasance charges against four staff members at CAL's Nagoya
office.</P>
      <P>After extensive investigations, the prosecutor's office said it
could not find sufficient evidence to justify negligence or
malfeasance charges against the CAL ground service staff over the
crash, which killed 264 passengers and crew members. Only seven
people aboard the ill-fated plane survived.</P>
      <P>Japanese investigators said in March 1999 that they found the
pilot and co-pilot of the plane had committed crucial errors that
resulted in the crash. However, as both of them died in the crash,
Japanese prosecutors decided not to indict them posthumously.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor's office then began to probe whether four CAL
staff members, including Chang Kuang-feng, then-deputy head of the
CAL Nagoya office, should be held responsible for the tragic
incident.</P>
      <P>In January 2000, the prosecutor's office decided for the first
time not to indict the CAL staff on the grounds that no convincing
evidence could be found that would prove their roles in the tragedy.</P>
      <P>However, higher-level Nagoya prosecution authorities disagreed
with the decision and demanded that the district prosecutor's office
reopen its probe into the case.</P>
      <P>After an additional year of investigations, Nagoya prosecutors
came to the conclusion recently that there are practical difficulties
involved in probing the CAL staff's responsibilities in the crash and
that this time, the decision to drop charges against the CAL staff
would be final, prosecution sources said.</P>
      <P>The CAL office in Nagoya declined to comment on the decision,
saying that it has not received formal notice from the Nagoya
District Prosecutor's Office.</P>
      <P>Relatives of about 160 Japanese crash victims have filed a suit
with the Nagoya District Court seeking some US$257 million in damages
from CAL. The court is still handling the case -- the biggest single
damages suit in connection with an air crash in Japan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
said Monday that Taiwan's hot spring industry should strengthen
international exchanges so as to bring the industry to the attention
of the international community.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while receiving Guy Ebrard, honorary
president of the Federation Mondiale Du Thermalisme Et Du Climatisme
(FEMTEC) and Vice President Jean-Luc Thonnat at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>They are in Taiwan for an eight-day visit at the invitation of
the Taiwan Hot Spring Association.</P>
      <P>Noting that FEMTEC is a non-government organization recognized by
the World Health Organization (WHO), Lu called on her visitors to
help Taiwan's hot spring industry join FEMTEC as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>She said that the Taiwan hot spring industry is an important
source of revenue for the tourism industry but still has great
untapped potential.</P>
      <P>She stressed that the local hot spring industry should cooperate
with the government to promote international exchanges and praised
efforts made by FEMTEC to promote the medical properties of hot
springs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chun-ting, deputy general secretary of the Taiwan
Hot Spring Association, said that Taiwan is expected to join FEMTEC
within the next two years.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1938, the organization originally included hot springs
in Europe and did not expand to a world-wide organization until 1976.
FEMTEC now has some 30 country and regional members.</P>
      <P>Ebrard and Thonnat will take part in a national hot spring
meeting Wednesday and will hold a symposium with officials of the

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT LINKS NOT `DOMESTIC ROUTES': PFP LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  9  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct links between Taiwan and mainland
China could be designated as "cross-Taiwan Strait" routes rather than
the term "domestic routes" as previously demanded by Beijing, People
First Party (PFP) lawmaker Liu Song-pan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan to report
on a recent six-day fact-finding trip to mainland China by a PFP
delegation, Liu said that this was the consensus reached during a
round of talks with mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen.</P>
      <P>Liu, heading a six-member PFP delegation, returned to Taipei last
Friday following visits to Beijing, Tianjin and Xian to gauge
mainland China's position and viewpoints regarding the establishment
of full trade, transport and postal links between Taiwan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>According to the power broker who served as the former
legislative speaker, the PFP lawmakers, through arrangements by
Beijing's semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait, also discussed the "full three links" issue with many
mainland Chinese officials from different government organizations.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that no agreement or consensus was made until
the meeting with Qian, as the mainland Chinese side had until that
point insisted on making the two-way "direct three links" a domestic
issue under the "one China" precondition.</P>
      <P>Liu said the PFP delegation expressed its refusal to accept the
"one China" stance and achieved a breakthrough on the issue when Qian
finally agreed not to insist on the "difficulty."</P>
      <P>According to Liu, vessels of either side sailing between Taiwan
proper and mainland China would not have to fly any flags in the
future. He noted that the establishment of the so-called cross-strait
transport links could be handled based on the Hong Kong model, under
which bilateral negotiations can be commissioned to the private
sector.</P>
      <P>As to the question of Taiwan's fear that farm products from
mainland China will have a heavy impact on the local agricultural
industry after both sides join the World Trade Organization, Liu said
Qian also agreed to consider a proposal that mainland China could
take the initiative to set up a quota system to limit its
agricultural exports to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As one of Taiwan's main opposition parties rather than the ruling
party, however, the PFP has no authority to make policy decisions
with mainland officials, so the consensus reached with Qian was
purely hypothetical.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTOR DROPS CHARGES AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENTIAL AIDES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  9  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two confidants of former President Lee
Teng-hui were cleared Monday by a local prosecutor of giving away
state secrets.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor said in her ruling that there is no evidence Su
Chih-cheng, Lee's personal secretary, and Cheng Su-ming, a former
executive at a local television station, gave away state secrets
during secret encounters with Beijing emissaries in Hong Kong and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Su had allegedly told his Beijing counterparts during one such
encounter that Taiwan would agree to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) under the name of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu
Customs Area.</P>
      <P>Su's critics at the Legislative Yuan accused him of leaking the
government's bottom line in its pursuit of WTO access, a crime
punishable under the Criminal Code, and that his visit to mainland
China was prohibited by the National Security Law owing to his senior
rank in the government hierarchy.</P>
      <P>However, the prosecutor accepted Su's arguments that the fact
that Taiwan would settle for WTO membership with the name of a
customs zone rather than its official name was made public in early
1990, well before his meetings with Beijing's point man in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"Classified information, once divulged, is no longer secret or
protected under the Criminal Code," said the prosecutor, citing a
decision by the Supreme Court as grounds to dismiss the charge.</P>
      <P>As for the National Security Law which prohibits officials of
Su's rank from visiting mainland China, the prosecutor noted that it
was promulgated in 1996, and thereby cannot be applied retroactively
to activity that took place prior to 1996.</P>
      <P>Acting on the orders of then-President Lee, Su met with Beijing
representatives secretly in Hong Kong and mainland China between
September 1987 and December 1993, in the hope of creating a climate
favorable to open bilateral dialogue, according to the prosecutor's
investigation.</P>
      <P>Secret contacts through emissaries is normal diplomatic practice
followed by many states and a vital means toward easing the tension
between Taiwan and mainland China in light of the long-standing
rivalry and the absence of official ties between the two sides, the
prosecutor said in her ruling.</P>
      <P>She also noted that Lee was interviewed in late March as a
witness in the case and that his testimony substantiated Su's
protestation of innocence.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who accompanied Su on his secret mission as a cover, was
also acquitted of the charges.</P>
      <P>Lee's secret contacts with Beijing leaders came to light in July
2000 when a self-proclaimed go-between claimed credit for brokering
the encounters and broke the information to a local magazine,
creating an outcry among ROC politicians.</P>
      <P>Lee's political rivals from the island's pro-reunification camp,
which are often denounced by Lee's supporters as traitors, turned the
tables on Lee by accusing Su and Cheng of selling out the island with
Lee's connivance.</P>
      <P>They filed a complaint against Su and Cheng with the Taipei
Prosecutors' Office, and asked the Control Yuan for an investigation
into the former president for good measure.</P>
      <P>Although the Control Yuan has yet to finish its probe, Sunday's
China Times quoted a Control Yuan official as hinting that it intends
to clear the former president of any wrongdoing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Heads of local governments in central
Taiwan urged the central government Monday to lift a ban on mainland
Chinese tourists as a way to boost the flagging local economy
devastated by the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake.</P>
      <P>During the "Summit of Central Taiwan Leaders," staged in
Nantou, heads of Nantou County, Taichung County, Changhua County and
the deputy head of Taichung City joined business leaders from their
constituencies in calling on the government to ease legal
restrictions on mainland Chinese travelers to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Peng Pai-hsien said that allowing
mainland tourists to visit can deepen their understanding of Taiwan,
while the cash they bring in would give the local economy a badly
needed shot in the arm.</P>
      <P>However, one of the priorities of the local governments is to
restore fully the natural beauty of attractions in central Taiwan,
such as Mount Ali and Sun Moon Lake, in order to draw in tourists.</P>
      <P>He also called for the central government's help in the
conclusion of sisterhood ties between Sun Moon Lake in Nantou and
Xihu (West Lake) in Zhejiang Province, central China.</P>
      <P>Changhua County Magistrate Juan Kang-meng blamed the central
government's "long-standing neglect" of the island's central region
for contributing to the area's faltering economy as much as the
earthquake.</P>
      <P>Chen Ta-chun, deputy mayor of Taichung City, called on the
central government to open industrial zones in central Taiwan to
mainland firms, to help local people upgrade their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>In a related development, meanwhile, Huang Jung-chun, an
executive director of the Sept. 21 Quake Aftermath Reconstruction
Commission under the Executive Yuan, estimated at a symposium on
promoting Nantou tourism that the tourism industry suffered damage
worth more than NT$30 billion (US$937.5 million) in the 1999
earthquake.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO REMOVE MINES FROM FRONTLINE ISLANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  April 9 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai urged the
government Monday to do more to clear the thousands of mines
scattered over Taiwan's offshore frontline islands.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Chen said that mine clearing is a
global trend, adding that with the advent of the cross-Taiwan Strait
"three mini links," the government should consider more aggressive
mine clearing operations to illustrate to the international community
the Republic of China's determination to seek peace.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the laying of land mines in Kinmen had its
background in the era of cross-strait confrontation. However, he
added, the mines have caused many deaths and injuries over the years.</P>
      <P>Now that the cross-strait relationship has thawed, he went on, it
is necessary for the government to review the issue of the mines.</P>
      <P>Troops stationed on Kinmen began removing the mines in 1996 after
the government ended the military control of the civil
administration. Most recently, Kinmen County Hall entrusted a foreign
de-mining company with the removal of land mines in order to build a
cross-sea bridge and a port at Shuitou, but Chen said these
initiatives were insufficient.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HEALER CLAIMING SUPERNATURAL POWERS INDICTED</HEADLINE>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei prosecutors on Tuesday indicted a
mainland Chinese woman claiming to have supernatural healing powers
on charges of fraud and practicing medicine without a license.</P>
      <P>Zhang Ying, who arrived in Taiwan with her locally born husband
last December, has been barred from leaving the island since January,
pending an end to the preliminary investigations that began when
prosecutors were alerted to her claims that she can see through
bodies to diagnose diseases and can snatch pills out of thin air.</P>
      <P>Taipei District Prosecutor Director Chang Wen-cheng said that
Zhang is suspected of violating the Medical Practice Law and the
Criminal Law for providing medicine to nearly 10 "patients," who were
led to believe that she had supernatural powers.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutor's office, between Dec. 28 and Jan. 5,
each person who asked for Zhang's services allegedly paid her US$200
per visit or treated her to a meal.</P>
      <P>The bill of indictment stated that Zhang is suspected of hiding a
pinch of powder containing Chinese medicine ingredients in the palm
of her hand or under a table during her "treatment" sessions. In a
sleight of hand trick, she would then rub the powder into a pill, the
prosecutors alleged.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Szu-tao, a local woman who helped introduce patients to
Zhang, was also indicted for allegedly violating the Medical Practice
Law.</P>
      <P>In an interview with local television reporters after the
indictment, Zhang held to her claim that her supernatural powers are
real.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA TO SET 'SUNSET CLAUSE' ON FOREIGN LABOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) said Tuesday it plans to adopt a "sunset" clause to gradually
retrieve foreign laborer import quotas from individual companies in
order to protect local people's working rights and opportunities.</P>
      <P>If the plan goes smoothly, the CLA said, individual companies
will no longer enjoy foreign laborer import quotas nine years later.</P>
      <P>"By then, the CLA will decide whether to reopen the local job
market to foreign workers based on the domestic employment
situation," said a CLA official.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the CLA has come up with the "sunset
clause" proposal after holding a series of meetings with labor
unions executives and grass-roots labor affairs administrators in
northern, central, southern and eastern Taiwan late last year to
solicit their views on the government's foreign labor policy and
feasible ways to curb a steady rise in the domestic unemployment
rate.</P>
      <P>"The CLA has completed a report on the results of those
meetings," the official said, adding that county and city
governments and labor unions around the island presented a total of
67 recommendations for lowering the unemployment rate and increasing
job opportunities for local citizens.</P>
      <P>"And foreign laborers-related proposals account for 11 of the
total," the official noted.</P>
      <P>Among others, the Hsinchu County labor union suggested that the
government more accurately and effectively control the number of
migrant workers to prevent them from elbowing local workers out of
the domestic job market.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "substitute effect" of the entry of migrant
workers has surfaced, the Hsinchu labor union complained that some
local employers have quietly laid off local workers shortly after
they hired foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, it said, those companies usually declined to give
local workers any layoff documents because under current regulations,
a decline in the number of local citizens employed by a specific
firm would result in a decrease in the number of foreigners it could
legally hire.</P>
      <P>The county government of Taoyuan, which boasts the largest number
of migrant workers among local counties and cities, said the influx
of migrant workers have not only affected local people's job
opportunities but also affected the general living environment and
quality in grass-roots residential communities in the county.</P>
      <P>It suggested that the CLA imposes a ceiling on the number of
migrant workers each county or city can accommodate.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan labor union also said many local employers have
regarded "hiring foreign laborers" as a panacea for lowering their
personnel costs. Against this backdrop, some companies have either
set strict age limits or offered lower working terms to discourage
local citizens from taking jobs at their factories.</P>
      <P>The Ilan County Government suggested that the CLA set a "sunset"
clause to stop employment of foreign workers in six to eight years
and gradually cut the annual quota for foreign laborers to increase
local people's job opportunities.</P>
      <P>In response to all those suggestions, the CLA has reaffirmed its
policy of cutting the number of legal migrant workers by 15,000 per
year. In addition, the CLA said it has been promoting various
measures to stamp further growth in migrant work force. For
instance, the CLA has tightened screening of applications for hiring
foreign caretakers and has demanded that the manufacturing sector
slash the number of foreign workers by 10 percent annually.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TO BLAIM FOR DANGEROUS MID-AIR CONFRONTATION: DEFENSE NEWS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  9  (CNA)
(By  Nelson  Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is largely to blame for the
dangerous cat-and-mouse confrontation between a U.S. Navy
surveillance plane and two mainland Chinese jetfighters off the coast
of Hainan Island on April 1, according to an editorial in the latest
issue of Defense News.</P>
      <P>The editorial published in the weekly said that the central issue
is Communist China's refusal to support a code of conduct for all
forces and nations operating in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>The collision that occurred was an accident waiting to happen,
and likely will be followed by even graver international incidents if
rules of engagement are not codified and accepted by all nations with
a military and commercial presence in the region, the editorial said.</P>
      <P>Professional investigators should be allowed to determine whether
the lumbering U.S. EP-3 reconnaissance plane rammed the Chinese F-8
fighter in airspace belonging to mainland China as claimed by Beijing
or whether the F-8 jetfighter recklessly disrupted a routine U.S.
patrol in international waters as asserted by the U.S. Pacific
Command, the editorial said.</P>
      <P>Of larger consequence to U.S.-mainland China relations and the
stability of the region at large, the editorial pointed out, are the
conflicting views regarding national sovereignty versus the
territorial integrity of international waterways and airspace of the
South China Sea.</P>
      <P>Beijing claims the entire area as its backyard basin, with
official mainland Chinese maps depicting the nation's borders
extending to the coastlines of the Philippines, through the Paracel
and Spratly islands, and around Malaysia.</P>
      <P>"This is unreasonable and unacceptable," the editorial
emphasized, saying that Beijing has repeatedly stymied attempts by
the United States, members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and other interested countries in the region,
including Japan and Australia, to address the issue through
multilateral channels.</P>
      <P>Defense News said that ASEAN and observer nations to the ASEAN
Regional Forum, which deals with security affairs, should insist that
Communist China forsake its unrealistic territorial claims and
present a reasonable map for expert, international consideration.</P>
      <P>As for the immediate crisis as a result of the collision, the
weekly added, a joint board of inquiry, staffed with legal and
technical experts from ASEAN countries, would be a fitting way to put
six years of intensive U.S.-mainland Chinese bilateral
military-to-military cooperation to the test.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED TO FREEZE OR RELAX LABOR STANDARDS LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A scholar on Tuesday urged the government
to freeze or relax the Labor Standards Law to help ease the worsening
unemployment situation.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University professor Wu Chung-chi made the
remarks at a public hearing held at the Legislative Yuan. The
opposition Kuomintang invited its party legislators, officials and
scholars to attend the public hearing on helping unemployed laborers.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) recently reported that the jobless rate in February hit 3.7
percent and that the jobless rate among laborers hit 4.74 percent for
the first time, or almost double the figure among white-collar
workers.</P>
      <P>Professor Wu said that although a rising jobless rate is
unavoidable with the bursting of Taiwan's economic bubble, the main
culprit behind the increasing unemployment rate is the regulation
concerning the minimum wage, currently at NT$15,840 (US$480) per
month, in the Labor Standard Law.</P>
      <P>Wu said that this has resulted in the labor market's
self-adjustment mechanism becoming rigid.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the government should address the jobless problem,
not wipe out the jobless situation, adding that the Labor Standard
Law should be frozen or relaxed.</P>
      <P>Hong Yuh-chin, executive director of the KMT Central Policy
Committee, said that laborers should have the right to be free from
the prospect of losing their jobs, adding that to help the employment
situation, the KMT will work with the government for an employment

    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation from Vietnam led by the
deputy mayor of Ho Chi Minh City met with business leaders in central
Taiwan Tuesday at a meeting held at the Taichung World Trade Center
to brief potential investors on the investment climate in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Taichung is one of four legs on the delegation's itinerary, which
will also take the visitors to northern and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During their stay in Taichung, Tran Ngoc Con, the deputy mayor of
Vietnam's capital, and his delegation paid a call on Taichung Mayor
Chang Wen-ying and Deputy Mayor Chen Ta-chun.</P>
      <P>Tran said that Taiwan's business investment in Vietnam
constitutes 22.1 percent of all foreign investment in his country,
making it Vietnam's second largest source of foreign investment after
South Korea.</P>
      <P>He said Ho Chi Minh City, with better social order than any other
city in Vietnam, offers Taiwan businesspeople a privileged investment
environment. However, he acknowledged that the city is still trying
to overcome a power shortage problem -- a drawback to the city's
efforts to attract investment by high-technology companies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, government
officials and political leaders of all stripes on Tuesday visited the
home of senior presidential adviser and former vice president Shieh
Tung-ming to mourn his passing.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung noted after paying his respects that
Shieh, who was 95 when he passed away Sunday night, was the first
Taiwan-born provincial governor and vice president.</P>
      <P>Chang praised Shieh for his contributions to the country, adding
that Shieh's life can be considered a condensed history of Taiwan's
progress.</P>
      <P>Also present included Vice President Annette Lu, Interior
Minister Chang Po-ya, Environmental Protection Administrator Hau
Lung-bin, People First Party Chairman James Soong, former vice
president Li Yuan-zu, former premier Lee Huan and opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>Shieh's daughter-in-law, KMT Vice Chairwoman Helen C.C. Lin, said
that the family will abide by Shieh's will to conduct only simple
memorial services.</P>
      <P>Thanking all political parties for putting aside their
differences to recognize Shieh's lifelong contributions, Lin turned
downed separate offers from the presidential office and the KMT to
establish an honorary ad hoc committee to help carry out funeral
arrangements.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the Shieh family has already decided not to hold an
elaborate public funeral service but will instead cremate Shieh's
remains Saturday and conduct a memorial ceremony April 22 at the
concert hall of Shih Chien University, a private university that he
founded.</P>
      <P>Shieh's ashes will then be returned to Changhua County and laid
to rest beside those of his wife, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Shieh was vice president under the former KMT administration from
1978 to 1984. As the first non-military provincial governor of
Taiwan, he advocated the development of grass-roots politics and
would often visit small towns and villages across the island to
listen to the voices of the people.</P>
      <P>A package bomb mailed to his office while he was serving as
provincial governor exploded in his left hand, forcing an amputation.
Wang Hsing-nan, the man who mailed the bomb to highlight the cause of
Taiwan independence, served 13 years in prison and is presently a
legislator from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HANKUANG EXERCISE ENTERS STAGE OF LIVE-FIRE TRAINING DRILLS: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said Tuesday that the ongoing "Hankuang No. 17" military exercise has
entered a stage of live-fire training drills aimed at verifying the
effectiveness of various anti-landing and air and naval defense
strategies.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Huang Suey-sheng further said at a routine MND
news conference that the live-fire drills will include three sections
-- combined services air and naval combat training as well as
combined services anti-landing exercises.</P>
      <P>"The annual large-scale Hankuang exercise began March 22 this
year and will last through April 22," Huang said, adding that the
first stage of the maneuvers, which ended last week, was focused on
cyber war games.</P>
      <P>"The live-fire stage is mainly designed to examine the results of
the restructuring of military units and various personnel training
programs under the MND's 10-year troop reduction plan aimed at
establishing an elite deterrent force," Huang explained.</P>
      <P>With the participation of all newly restructured or recently
formed army, naval and air force units, Huang said, the live-fire
drills will also assess the military's battlefield management
efficiency and test the adaptability of its new generation of
weaponry and the effectiveness of the present combined battlefield
command mechanism.</P>
      <P>"The results of the training exercises will serve as reference
for improving and augmenting the combined combat capabilities of the
three branches of our armed forces," Huang noted, adding that the
Army, Navy and Air Force General Headquarters are responsible for
organizing various combined services combat training drills.</P>
      <P>For instance, Huang said, the Army General Headquarters will play
a leading role in a live-fire combined services anti-landing training
exercise to be held in waters off southern Taiwan's Pingtung County
on April 20. The Air Force's F5E squadron and Navy's missile speed
boat fleet will also take part in the upcoming anti-landing exercise.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang said, the military-run Chungshan Institute of
Science and Technology-developed RT-2000 artillery multiple-launching
rocket system (AMLRS) will be test-fired for the first time in the
April 20 anti-landing drill.</P>
      <P>Huang declined to make any comments on reports that the Navy's
anti-ship Hsiungfeng II missiles failed to hit the projected target
and the Army's vehicle-launched Avenger air-defense missiles and
shoulder-fired Stinger missiles either overshot the target or were
forced to give up shooting due to a failure to position the weapons
within the required time limit.</P>
      <P>He merely said that the main purposes of the training exercise
are to find deficiencies and drawbacks so that operations can be
improved.</P>
      <P>Huang further stressed that the test-firing of the "Patriot PAC-2
plus" anti-missile defense system has not been included in the
current Hankuang No. 17 exercise. "The timing for Patriot test-firing
has yet to be decided," he added.</P>
      <P>Huang also said the MND has not arranged for President Chen
Shui-bian to preside over the present military exercise from the very
beginning, denying the report that Chen canceled his plan to chair
the exercise amid the ongoing U.S.-mainland China standoff over a
military aircraft collision in South China Sea.</P>
      <P>As to the issue regarding confidence-building measures between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Huang said the MND would be very
pleased to forge such a mechanism.</P>
      <P>"However, it takes two to tango. We can't solely reach that goal
without the cooperation of mainland China," Huang explained, adding
that the MND's regular issue of defense white papers and unveiling of
a detailed schedule of its military training drills at the beginning
of every year are part of Taiwan's efforts to increase military
transparency and minimize possible miscalculations by the mainland
military.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY BLASTS STATE ENTERPRISES FOR ALLEGED BUDGETING PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition New Party Tuesday blasted
government enterprises for a series of alleged budgeting problems
ranging from deliberately low or high income projections and reliance
on property sales and accrued interest to stay in the black.</P>
      <P>Chang Shih-liang, the deputy convener of the party's legislative
caucus, charged at a press conference that for six out of the 40
state-run enterprises, the difference between their original budgets
and final tabulations of income and expenditures actually exceeds 100
percent.</P>
      <P>He went on to cite Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corp. as the
most blatant transgressor in this regard, charging that when the
company says it can make NT$100, it actually only makes NT$21.7.</P>
      <P>Chang also accused other state-run companies of intentionally
lowering their income estimates to make annual operational goals
easier to attain. Any amount beyond their income estimates then bring
in additional bonuses for the "excess" productivity, he added.</P>
      <P>He fingered Central Deposit Insurance Corp., Chinese Petroleum
Corp. and the Central Trust of China as the worst examples of this
practice, budgeting 54 percent, 37 percent and 23 percent short of
their actual annual incomes, respectively.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to punish any company and its supervisory
government agency that continues to show a difference of greater than
10 percent between its projected and actual income.</P>
      <P>Chang also alleged that over two-thirds of government enterprises
rely on property sales and interest income. If these sources of
income were not taken into consideration, the number of state-run
companies in the red would jump from five to 11, he added.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to seek out the help of professionals and
scholars and work out ways to lower costs for these companies or even
close them before they become excessive burdens to the taxpayers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANNUAL  GROWTH  OF IMPORTS, EXPORTS MAY HIT NEW POST-FINANCIAL CRISIS LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) predicted
Tuesday that growth in exports this year might only amount to 0.5
percent, while imports might actually shrink, setting new lows since
1997'S regional financial storm.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the MOF Department of Statistics, said
that with the closure of domestic plants and the exodus of domestic
industries, import demand and domestic investment have both been hit
hard. The situation has been compounded by the sluggish world
economy, so foreign trade growth is likely to slow, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks after the MOF published figures showing that
exports in the first quarter hit US$31.71 billion, and imports in the
same period reached US$28.41 billion, down 3.5 percent and 10.0
percent respectively from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The MOF noted that the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) has predicted that exports this year would
grow by 4.21 percent, while import growth will be 3.39 percent. But
with the sluggish economy in Taiwan and other parts of the world, the
DGBAS in May might sharply slash its forecasts for export and import
growth this year, the MOF said.</P>
      <P>The MOF said that exports in March totaled US$117.4 billion, down
1.8 percent from the same period last year, while imports in March
totaled US$10.03 billion, down 13.1 percent from the same period
in 2000. Taiwan's trade surplus hit US$1.71 billion in March, the
highest monthly surplus since June 1999.</P>
      <P>March imports and exports both surpassed the US$10 billion mark,
showing that though trade has decreased slightly, it is still in good
shape.</P>
      <P>The MOF said that exports to Hong Kong and Europe actually
increased slightly in March, but this was offset by decreased exports
to the United States, Japan and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN). Imports from the major regions, such as the United
States, Japan and ASEAN, also decreased.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO ALLOW MAINLAND FISHERY WORKERS TO ENTER PORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 100 fishermen from Taipei County
and the neighboring port city of Keelung appealed Tuesday for the
assistance of the Legislative Yuan to push the government to allow
mainland Chinese fishery workers to enter local ports.</P>
      <P>The petitioners said at a public hearing in the legislature that
they most hope the government will allow mainland crew members
working on their fishing boats to come ashore to help them unload
their catches of fish. The hearing was co-organized by a group of
ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislators.</P>
      <P>"Or at least, the government should allow mainland fishery
workers to enter local ports," said Chen Yu-heng, a senior executive
with the Kungliao Fishermen's Association in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>At present, the Republic of China government permits local
fishing boat owners to hire mainland sailors to work on their ships,
but bans mainlanders from entering Taiwan ports or coming ashore. As
a result, mainland fishery workers have to stay aboard ships moored
offshore.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government should ease the restrictions.
"Otherwise, local ship owners have a hard time unloading fish catches
and repairing fishing nets," he explained.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that the operations of the local fishing industry
have been seriously affected since the National Coast Guard
Administration intensified a crackdown on boats carrying mainland
fishery workers into local ports late last month.</P>
      <P>Responding to the fishermen's appeal, Sha Chih-yi, deputy
director of the Fishery Administration under the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture (COA), said that the government currently only
allows fishing industry firms to hire mainlanders to work on the high
seas in consideration of the especially harsh working environment,
which makes it difficult to attract domestic employees.</P>
      <P>"This is a special favor for local fishermen," Sha said, adding
that there is still no legal basis to allow mainland fishery workers
to land on Taiwan or enter local ports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, COA Chairman Chen Hsi-huang said during a Legislative
Yuan plenary session that the COA is reviewing current regulations
and will work out a new package of measures to better regulate the
employment of mainland fishery workers on Taiwan-owned fishing boats.</P>

historical and realistic facts.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama said that the status of Taiwan and Tibet are two

Tibet issue.</P>

the Voice of America prior to his departure from Taiwan following a
10-day visit to the island-state.</P>
      <P>The top Tibetan Buddhist monk told the Voice of America that the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STRAIT STABILITY ROC'S TOP MAINLAND POLICY GOAL: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April 10 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait
is the Republic of China's top mainland policy goal, a visiting ROC
official in charge of mainland China affairs said in Osaka Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a meeting of overseas Chinese community leaders in
the Asia-Pacific region, Chen Ming-tong, vice chairman of the ROC's
Mainland Affairs Council, said although cross-strait talks have been
stalled, bilateral trade and cultural exchanges have become ever
brisker.</P>
      <P>"The cross-strait relations have made progress quietly over the
past year, and we see a silver lining on the horizon for further
development in bilateral ties in the future," Chen said, adding it's
a remarkable achievement of the 11-month-old administration of
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that Taiwan has never ceased its
preparations for the reopening of regular dialogue with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>"When the time is ripe, we can resume talks with mainland China
on various kinds of topics of mutual concern and work together to
improve bilateral relations," Chen said optimistically.</P>
      <P>Noting that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should forge a
framework for long-term steady development of bilateral ties on a
cooperative and reciprocal basis, Chen said all overseas Chinese are
welcome to pool their wisdom and energy to assist the ROC government
in promoting friendly, constructive cross-strait interaction.</P>
      <P>Chen further pointed out that Taipei's and Beijing's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) will certainly
trigger a significant change in the general environment for
cross-strait interaction.</P>
      <P>"This is a challenge that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should
face. And we look forward to discussing relevant issues with mainland
China as early as possible," chen said, adding that it is very
important for the two sides to forge orderly exchanges based on the
principles of market economy and political democratization.</P>
      <P>In preparation for Taipei's and Beijing's WTO accession, Chen
said, the ROC hopes to hammer out a mechanism for cross-strait
interchanges in line with the principles of openness and national
security.</P>
      <P>Touching on the sensitive "one China" issue, Chen said the ROC
cannot accept Beijing's "one China" principle because it
deliberately ignores the ROC's existence.</P>
      <P>"President Chen said in his inaugural speech that the two sides
should cultivate a climate favorable for cross-strait cooperation in
dealing with the issue regarding a 'future one China,'" Chen said,
adding that the declaration signifies the ROC's positive, active and
constructive attitude on resolving bilateral disputes through
peaceful dialogue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PM ORDERS PROBE INTO SLAUGHTER OF RARE ANIMALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, shocked by
reports that large numbers of wild animals have been slaughtered in
the mountains of Central Taiwan, ordered a probe Tuesday into the
deaths.</P>
      <P>Under the premier's instructions, the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) began to look into the killings, offering NT$1
million as a cash reward for clues leading to the apprehension of the
perpetrators.</P>
      <P>Chang's directive was prompted by a report by a local TV station,
whose "Taiwan Records" program disclosed the discovery of the
carcasses of Formosan sambars, Formosan Reeve's muntjacs and
long-haired goats in a recent expedition deep into the mountains of
the Central Range.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that dozens of wild animals endemic to
Taiwan were found dead at the same time in the same close region --
the Dandah Forest Reservation Area located in the Central Range
around the headwaters of the Choshui River -- Taiwan's longest -- and
the Nantou County and Taitung County border.</P>
      <P>According to the TV report, dozens of the carcasses were found in
brushwood near a brook.</P>
      <P>The dead animals are believed to have been killed by
non-aboriginal hunters shooting for fun rather than for economic
purposes, since all the corpses were left behind and only the antlers
and genitalia of the male sambars were removed, according to the TV
report.</P>
      <P>The Dandah Forest Reservation Area is one of the most important
habitats for wild animals in Taiwan and is home to the largest number
of Formosan sambars.</P>
      <P>In related news, meanwhile, the COA's Taiwan Endemic Species
Research Institute has found that another endemic animal -- the
Formosan macaque -- has been excessively hunted or killed by farmers
islandwide.</P>
      <P>Although the number of Formosan macaques is estimated at only
around 250,000 islandwide, the monkeys are widely hunted by longan
and bamboo shoot farmers so as to protect their crops, according to
COA officials.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Katherine Chang said Tuesday that former President Lee
Teng-hui had applied for a Japanese visa so that he can visit the
country later this month for medical treatment.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that the Japanese government will grant
Lee a visa, as he holds no government posts and is therefore
technically free to visit any country he wishes as a private citizen.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Lee presented his application to the Taipei
office of the quasi-official Japan Interchange Association, stating
that he wants to undertake treatment for heart illness before April
24.</P>
      <P>An invitation to Lee from an attending surgeon in Okayama
Prefecture was attached to the application to indicate that Lee is
required to undertake the treatment before April 24, said Chang.</P>
      <P>She noted that the ROC representative office in Tokyo will be
instructed to negotiate with the Japanese government for visa
issuance.</P>
      <P>As a free and democratic country, she pointed out, Japan should
not be influenced by another country, including mainland China, into
rejecting Lee's application.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen whether the Japanese government will grant
a visa to Lee, who has been labeled by Beijing as a splittist and an
advocate of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Some foreign reports indicated that outgoing Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori intends to help Lee realize his long-cherished
wish to visit Japan.</P>
      <P>But Mori will be replaced as president of the ruling Liberal

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES 2001 `BASEBALL YEAR' FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian announced Tuesday
that 2001 will be "Baseball Year for Taiwan" as part of an effort to
revitalize the sport.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement while receiving members of the Chinese
Taipei Baseball Team, which recently won the Asian Championship for
the first time in 12 years.</P>
      <P>He praised the team's performance at the 21st Asian Baseball
Championship Tournament held at the Hsinchuang Stadium in suburban
Taipei last month and stressed that baseball should distance itself
from the corruption that the local game has become perhaps best-known
for. Only clean, good performances and competitive tournaments will
attract baseball fans back to the stadiums, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>In line with Chen's "baseball year," the Chinese Taipei Baseball
Association will also sponsor three world-class events this year --
the Asian Baseball Championship, the World Baseball Championship
Tournament and the World Youth Baseball Championship Tournament.</P>
      <P>Noting that baseball is popular in Taiwan and claiming that "the
great majority of adults in Taiwan" would wake up at midnight to
watch a baseball game until the sport became tainted by corruption,
Chen said the plans for this year are the most remarkable
international activities devised by Taiwan under its adverse
diplomatic situation.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed hope that local amateurs and professionals will
cooperate to form a strong team to compete in the upcoming World
Baseball Championship Tournament scheduled to be held in Taiwan this
September. In addition to Taiwan, 15 teams from five continents will
compete in the competition.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that the national team will help the
government to upgrade and promote little, junior and big league
baseball.</P>
      <P>In return, Peng Cheng-hao, board chairman of the Chinese Taipei
baseball Association, voiced appreciation for Chen's support and
promised that the association will form a strong team to take part in
the September tournament.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHAD PEOPLE APPRECIATE ROC ASSISTANCE: COMMERCE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>N'Djamena,   April   10   (CNA)
(By  H.Y. Chou and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Every Chad citizen knows the
contribution that the Republic of China has made to the African
country and is grateful for its assistance to local society, Chad
Commerce, Industry &amp; Crafts Minister Kalzuede Tahini said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Chad government hopes to further strengthen
bilateral cooperation in the textile and cement industries, Tahini
said there is ample room for two-way cooperative ventures in a wide
range of fields.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while receiving a 31-member delegation from
Taiwan composed of small business owners in the biochemical,
electronics, Internet, kitchen furniture, construction and medical
equipment sectors. He noted that Chad is rich in natural resources,
but lacks technology and skilled workers.</P>
      <P>Making it clear that Chad needs Taiwan's assistance to improve
its economy, a straight-talking Tahini said Chad hopes to upgrade its
economic strength by sharing with Taiwan its development experience.</P>
      <P>Led by Day Sheng-tong, head of the ROC Association of Small and
Medium-Sized Enterprises, the trade-promotion team arrived in Chad
Monday on the first leg of a four-nation, 11-day African tour. The
local business community mobilized hundreds of people to give the
delegation a warm welcome and a performance of traditional folk
dances.</P>
      <P>The trade-promotion mission is slated to call on Chad President
Idriss Deby Wednesday and will attend an investment seminar organized
by local businessmen later in the day.</P>
      <P>According to ROC Ambassador Chiu Jong-jen, the local media have
carried extensive reports about the delegation's visit to Chad for
the past week, in the hope that Taiwan firms will invest here.</P>
      <P>Chiu also said that the Chad people are very thankful for
Taiwan's assistance, especially with infrastructure developments such
as building bridges, setting up oil refineries and digging wells for
potable water.</P>
      <P>Following its stay in Chad, the delegation will proceed to
Burkina Faso, Gambia and Senegal before returning to Taiwan April 21.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC GROWTH TO BE FURTHER READJUSTED DOWNWARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's overall economic growth is likely
to be lowered further than previous government estimates, due mainly
to sagging private sector consumption, an official from the Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>With the growth rate in private sector consumption dropping to 4
percent in the first quarter, the annual overall economic growth will
have to be readjusted downward this year, said CEPD Vice Chairman Lee
Kao-chao.</P>
      <P>According to CEPD tallies, Taiwan enjoyed a trade surplus of
US$3.3 billion in the first quarter of this year, marking a whopping
increase compared with the NT$1.3 billion posted in the same period
of last year.</P>
      <P>Although the Q-1 trade surplus has contributed to the country's
economic growth, the annual economic growth is unlikely to be as good
as previously estimated as long as consumption in the private sector
continues to slump, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Lee attributed the sagging private sector consumption to rising
unemployment and a weak Taiwan stock market, which began to lose
steam late last year and caused most of the investors to lose up to
half of their fortunes.</P>
      <P>Previously, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics estimated that Taiwan's Q-1 growth would top 4.02 percent,
while the annual growth would reach 5.25 percent.</P>
      <P>Lee forecast that the overall economic growth rate will not be as
high as 5.25 percent for 2001.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Chung-shu, a research fellow at Academia Sinica's
Institute of Economics, quoted his institute's estimate as indicating
that Taiwan's Q-1 growth will be around 3 percent, while the Q-2
performance is expected to be no better. The economy is likely to
bottom out from Q-3 but the subsequent jump will not be remarkable,
Wu forecast.</P>

      <P>The 13th annual convention of the Overseas
Chinese Council in Asia opened Tuesday in Osaka, Japan, with more
than 400 delegates from the Asia-Pacific region participating.</P>
      <P>The participants agreed unanimously in a declaration to stand
united in support of the Republic of China and to render their
assistance to help the ROC government promote relations between the
ROC and nations in the other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>The one-day meeting was chaired by Tsai Chung-chiu, president of
the Confederation of the Overseas Chinese Associations in Japan.</P>
      <P>Special guests included Yao Ing-chi, vice president of the ROC
Legislative Yuan; Chang Fu-mei, minister of the Cabinet-level
Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of
the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council and Lo Fu-chuan, ROC
representative to Japan.</P>
      <P>A written message from ROC President Chen Shui-bian was read at
the gathering in which he said that building Taiwan into an

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL SECRETARY BLASTS JAPANESE REFUSAL TO GRANT LEE VISA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Deputy Presidential Secretary-General Chen
Che-nan blasted the Japanese government Wednesday for its refusal to
grant former President Lee Teng-hui an entry visa, which Lee applied
for to visit Japan later this month for medical treatment.</P>
      <P>Chen, in response to questions at the Legislative Yuan, said the
Japanese government has no reason to refuse to grant a visa to Lee --
now a private citizen -- to have his heart checked in Japan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he supports Lee's desire to visit Japan for
medical reasons, Chen said Tokyo is seriously "sinophobic" and has
"intentionally politicized the issue."</P>
      <P>While Chen noted that Japan has no reason to refuse Lee a visa,
Kuomintang Legislator Liu Kuang-hua said the Republic of China's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) also has no reason to lodge an
official condemnation of the Japanese government for such a decision.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOFA spokeswoman Katherine Chang confirmed Wednesday
that Lee presented his application Tuesday to the Taipei office of
the quasi-official Japan Interchange Association, stating that he
wanted to undertake treatment for heart illness before April 24.</P>
      <P>Noting that MOFA officials stationed in Japan are currently
negotiating with Japanese authorities for the issuance of a visa for
Lee, Chang expressed the hope that the Japanese government will grant
the visa based on humanitarian considerations as well as on the fact
that Lee holds no government posts and is therefore technically free
to visit any country he wishes to as a private citizen.</P>
      <P>In Lee's application, according to Chang, an invitation to Lee
from an attending surgeon in Okayama Prefecture was attached to
indicate that Lee is required to undertake the treatment before April
24.</P>
      <P>Chang called for the Japanese authorities to "simplify" the whole
matter and free themselves of political considerations, which are
unnecessary and improper.</P>
      <P>Chang, meanwhile, pointed out that she has no idea why the Japan
Interchange Association said it had not received Lee's application as
of Tuesday evening.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUTHOR OF TIANANMEN PAPERS URGES M'LAND LEADERSHIP TO "FACE HISTORY"</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 10 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former mainland Chinese
civil servant and Communist Party member who secretly compiled "The
Tiananmen Papers" has urged the Communist Chinese leadership in an
essay to "face history" and redress the Tiananmen Square Massacre of
June 4, 1989.</P>
      <P>Radio Free Asia said it has obtained exclusive worldwide
Mandarin-language rights to the essay by Zhang Liang, and it began
daily broadcasts of excerpts in five parts Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The essay commemorates the 12th anniversary of the death of
former Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang and coincides with the April
15 publication in Mandarin Chinese of "The Tiananmen Papers."</P>
      <P>Zhang Liang wrote in the essay, titled "Commemorating Yaobang,
Thinking of (Zhao) Ziyang, and Messages to Jiang (Zemin) and Li
(Peng)," that nobody expected that the "nationwide mourning activity"
that followed Hu's sudden death in 1989 "would evolve into a movement
to expand democracy (and) severely punish corrupt officials,
incurring a bloody massacre."</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that, to mainland Chinese youths of today,
June 4, 1989, "is a blurry and distorted picture, or even a blank. To
their elders, June 4 is a scar from a healed wound that is no longer
painful. Some enthusiastic students and teachers, who readily
answered the call to gather, have simply forgotten about it."</P>
      <P>"Making money has prevailed in society for the past 12 years. It
has destroyed people's spiritual belief, confusing right and wrong,
and good and evil. The intellectual has become numb," Zhang wrote.</P>
      <P>"Being extremely disappointed about the (Communist) party and
government, more and more people turn to gods and Buddha for help.
Common people are unable to report their situation or get their
wrongful treatment redressed," he said.</P>
      <P>"Falun Gong arises as an inevitable result of the loss of social
belief." The Communist Party "is no longer a party that serves the
people," Zhang noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH CALLS BEIJING'S WHITE PAPER A "WHITEWASH"</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  10 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Human Rights Watch said Tuesday that
Beijing's new "White Paper" on human rights is clearly aimed at the
ongoing session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in
Geneva and is part of the same lobbying strategy that brought
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Latin America.</P>
      <P>The current session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission opened
March 19, and Communist China's human rights record is expected to be
discussed later this month.</P>
      <P>Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said that the
"so-called White Paper is a whitewash of China's human rights
practices."</P>
      <P>"But we've seen this combination before: high-level visits to
Latin America to get allies for the (U.N.) Commission, together with
the release of a report which boasts that China's human rights record
has never been better."</P>
      <P>Beijing published its first white paper on human rights in
November 1991 at a time when the memories of the Tiananmen Square
massacre were still fresh and pressure was building toward a
resolution on Communist China at the 1992 U.N. Human Rights
Commission session. Another white paper was published in March 1997
and yet another came out in February 1998, Jones pointed out.</P>
      <P>The New York-based human rights group director said there is also
a precedent for high-level visits to Latin America in the period just
prior to U.N. Human Rights Commission sessions.</P>
      <P>In late 1995, with a view to the 1996 session of the U.N. Human
Rights Commission, then mainland Chinese Premier Li Peng went to Peru
and Mexico. Before the 1997 session, Li visited two key commission
countries, Brazil and Chile, and Beijing's senior trade official Wu
Yi visited six Latin American countries, all but one of which were to
be members of the commission that year, said Human Rights Watch.</P>
      <P>Jones noted that of the six Latin American countries on Jiang
Zemin's current itinerary -- Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Cuba
and Venezuela -- all but Chile are members of the current commission.
Some of these countries might be inclined to join with the United
States, if not in sponsoring a resolution, then in trying to defeat
Beijing's efforts to ensure it will not come to a vote.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Residue from the violent sandstorms which
have ravaged northern China over the last week are expected to reach
Taiwan early Thursday, officials from the National Space Program
Office (SPO) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The SPO, which is under the Cabinet-level National Science
Council, has closely monitored the sandstorms with its
state-of-the-art ocean color-imaging (OCI) system over the past few
days and has estimated that the sandstorms, which blew up in the
deserts of northern China, will reach the Taiwan area at around 2
a.m. Thursday.</P>
      <P>China's northern regions have had an average of 15 sandstorms a
year over the past 50 years, making it one of the four major areas in
the world that sandstorms are most likely to occur.</P>
      <P>Airborne sand from China-originating sandstorms affected Taiwan
in late January and early March this year.</P>
      <P>The latest sandstorms were whipped up by a cold air mass coming
from Siberia and Mongolia and have swept through the drought-stricken
and dusty north-central mainland Chinese province of Gansu before
gradually traveling south and east to Hong Kong, Taiwan and the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>IPO officials said the sandstorms make the air extremely bad,
causing harm particular to the eyes and respiratory system. They
urged people in Taiwan to avoid outdoor activities during days when
sandstorms are affecting the local atmosphere.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of an investment and trade
promotion delegation from Indonesia's South Sumatra Province making a
three-day visit to Taiwan told businessmen Wednesday that "a lot can
be done" in the province.</P>
      <P>In a briefing on trade and investment opportunities in South
Sumatra at the Taipei World Trade Center, Governor Rosihan Arsyad
pointed out that the main purpose of the trade mission, consisting of
provincial government officials and entrepreneurs, is to meet with
local businessmen to promote South Sumatra's economic resources.</P>
      <P>Arsyad said that since January this year, the provincial
government is allowed to deal directly with potential foreign
investors who are interested in conducting business in South Sumatra.</P>
      <P>Arsyad noted that his government has committed to:</P>
      <P>-- Provide all information on economic potential, socio-cultural
aspects, laws and regulations, and "any other information required by
investors;"</P>
      <P>-- Simplify all procedures and mechanisms for conducting legal
business within the area of the province; and</P>
      <P>-- Maintain political stability to ensure that all economic
activities can be protected.</P>
      <P>Concerning South Sumatra's economic potential, Arsyad said that
his province still has a large acreage of arable land to support
agriculture and that there are varied investment opportunities in the
agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>He added that since the province also has large deposits of coal,
his government is looking for investors interested in establishing
coal-fired energy plants.</P>
      <P>Oil and natural gas are also major products of South Sumatra,
along with gold and silver, Arsyad said.</P>
      <P>He also introduced investment opportunities in other sectors,
including tourism.</P>
      <P>"South Sumatra is not far from Taipei. Therefore, it should be
considered as a tourist destination for people in Taipei," he said.</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation, who arrived here Tuesday, will leave
Taipei for Keelung Thursday to visit the Taiwan fisheries Research
Institute. They will also tour the Taiwan Livestock Products Research
Institute and other agricultural and industrial facilities in Ilan
County before leaving for Singapore Friday.</P>

      <P>A large delegation from the
Taiwan-controlled island of Kinmen took advantage of the "three mini
links" Wednesday to launch its first direct cultural and academic
voyage to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The 192-member delegation left Lianlo Harbor aboard a vessel run
by Kinmen County government for the mainland port of Xiamen for a
weeklong visit, which is expected to add momentum to the direct
trade, postal and transport links -- commonly known as the "mini
three links" -- between Kinmen, Matsu and mainland China implemented
since Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>The delegation, including a 53-member group led by Chang
Chun-chuan, director of Kinmen County Cultural Center, will attend
cultural and tourism activities in Xiamen.</P>
      <P>In addition, the delegation also includes Kinmen officials
currently studying in a program at National Sun Yat-sen University,
who are scheduled to have academic exchanges with Xiamen University.
As this is the largest Kinmen group of officials since Kinmen
magistrate Chen Shui-tsai led a delegation on the first direct voyage
to the mainland early this year, it has aroused media attention.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as a Xiamen trade fair on export commodities to Taiwan
opened Thursday, the delegation also includes 26 Kinmen business
council directors and supervisors.</P>
      <P>Other members of the delegation belong to private tourist groups.
Tourist agencies said that more than 20 tourists were unable to make
the trip because it was fully booked, showing that although tourist
arrivals have to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Xiamen

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Navy Commander-in-Chief
Adm. Li Chieh is currently on a visit to Washington, D.C. at the
invitation of the U.S. government, naval sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Officials with the Navy General Headquarters (NGH) said Li will
hold routine consultations with the U.S. Department of Defense on
Taiwan's naval defense needs.</P>
      <P>NGH officials said the U.S. government usually invites the
commander-in-chief of an ROC military branch to visit the United
States each year. They stressed that Li's visit has nothing to do
with the April 23 ROC-U.S. meeting on Taiwan's arms procurement plans
nor with the current U.S.-mainland China row over their military
aircraft collision over South China Sea early this month.</P>
      <P>Sources said Li is expected to deliver a report on details of his
U.S. visit to the Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan after his
return.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a CNA report from Washington said the U.S. State
Department confirmed Tuesday that the ROC navy chief "is in the
United States for routine consultations in the context of our regular
discussions about Taiwan's defense needs."</P>
      <P>Navy officials said Li left for the United States last Friday
after presiding over a combined services naval defense drill off the
eastern Taiwan coast as part of the ongoing "Hankuang No. 17"
military exercise.</P>
      <P>Li first visited the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii where he
exchanged views with American military officials on the Taiwan Strait
situation, military sources said.</P>
      <P>He arrived in Washington, D.C. Sunday for a five-day visit. While
there, Li will hold routine consultations with Pentagon officials on
Taiwan's defense needs.</P>
      <P>Li will also visit the Norfolk naval base in Virginia to have a
look at the Aegis radar-equipped destroyer, one of the advanced
weaponry systems that Taiwan wants to buy.</P>
      <P>Naval sources said Li was originally scheduled to visit the
United States late last year, but postponed the trip because the navy
was then reopening a probe into the murder of Captain Yin Ching-feng
and was also busy with handling previous warship procurement
scandals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITALIAN FATHER VOWED TO BE '7-ELEVEN' NANNY TO FOREIGN LABORERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Italian Catholic father Bruno Ciceri, who
calls himself the "7-Eleven" nanny to foreign laborers in Taiwan,
sometimes works around-the-clock in his Kaohsiung office to serve the
foreign workers and sailors who take temporary shelter in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Working 365 days a year, Ciceri has made Kaohsiung's Apostolatus
Maris Service Center a lighthouse for foreign nationals who are lost
or need help in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ciceri is particularly familiar with Filipinos and their affairs
as he worked for 10 years in the Philippines serving sailors and
refugees before coming to Taiwan seven years ago when Taiwan began to
introduce Filipino laborers to help out the island's households and
manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>Ciceri says he was frustrated during his first two years in
Taiwan because he spoke no mandarin Chinese, which made it difficult
for him to communicate, particularly with public offices in
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>As the number of Filipinos coming to Taiwan to work increased,
his workload and responsibilities soared, which both tired and
pleased him, although his Kaohsiung center is always desperately
short of funds to maintain its ever-expanding operations.</P>
      <P>The center provides help not only for foreign laborers and
sailors in Kaohsiung, but for foreign workers from all around the
island. Whether they have been unfairly treated or sexually harassed
by their Taiwanese employers, or physically abused by their Taiwanese
husbands, they go to the Apostolatus Maris Center for help.</P>
      <P>There they can find a "free lunch," while Ciceri and his helpers
offer free accommodation to help tide them over difficulties until
they can find new employment.</P>
      <P>Facing an increasingly heavy financial burden at the center,
Ciceri is calling for substantive help. He said that since the
Taiwanese authorities require Taiwan companies hiring foreign workers
to put aside a certain amount of money to be used as employment
security funds, they should also extend some help to centers like
Apostolatus Maris.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is expected to beef up
its sales of military software to the Republic of China over the next
10 to 20 years, a military researcher said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsiao-hsiang, head of the mainland China affairs research
division of the Graduate Institute of Political Science of
military-run Fuhsingkang College made the remarks at a seminar on
national defense issues.</P>
      <P>Huang said U.S. military experts have not hesitated to point out
in their assessment reports that Taiwan must strengthen integration
of the combat capabilities of its various military branches and
weaponry systems as well as further intensify personnel training.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the U.S. Defense Department has evaluated
Taiwan's capacity to withstand a pre-emptive first strike from
mainland China and its overall defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>"The Pentagon assessment says Taiwan's military operational
system and its command-control-communication-intelligence mechanism
can hardly pass practical warfare tests," Huang explained.</P>
      <P>In addition, Huang said, the Pentagon has also pointed out that
there is still room for Taiwan to improve integration of combat
capabilities among its various military units and weaponry systems.</P>
      <P>Huang went on to say that mainland China generally understands
the performance and tactical functions of nearly all weapons that the
United States has sold to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>From the tactical viewpoint, Huang said, mainland China does not
really care about Taiwan's purchases of normal defensive arms. "But
it has consistently paid close attention to whether Taiwan acquires
offensive weapons and its capability to integrate various weaponry
systems," he noted.</P>
      <P>Huang further said mainland China has recently assessed the ROC
Air Force's combat capability, particularly how its automatic
"Strong Net" early warning, command and control system will integrate
with the operations of the Air Force's warplane command center, the
Navy's combat operation center, the Army's surface-to-air missile
bases, the Air Force's anti-aircraft artillery command center and the
Civil Aeronautics Administration's airborne control center.</P>
      <P>"In other words, mainland China is especially concerned about
the efficacy of Taiwan's unified air-defense command system," Huang
explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang reminded local people not to be overly
optimistic about the results of the annual ROC-U.S. meeting on
Taiwan's arms procurement plans scheduled to open in Washington,
D.C. April 23.</P>
      <P>Noting that the U.S. policy toward Taiwan remains flexible and
uncertain, Huang said the United States will certainly safeguard
as much as possible its own national interests in the development of
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) on
Wednesday urged local compact disc manufacturers to be prepared for
the possibility that the European Union will impose temporary
anti-dumping tariffs on them in mid-June.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said that there are precedents for the European
Union to begin imposing such taxes during the first 60 days after the
start of anti-dumping investigations.</P>
      <P>The officials added that E.U. trade officials will draw random
samples Saturday from the 16 Taiwan CD makers accused of dumping by
their competitors in Germany, France, Italy and Holland. The
companies selected will then be asked to answer surveys and cooperate
with other investigations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently the world's largest CD manufacturing center,
exporting a total of US$1 billion of compact discs last year. Europe
is the island's largest export market, importing US$460 million worth
of compact discs from Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said that the temporary anti-dumping tax requested
by the four European CD makers is between 20 to 30 percent, and that
if the European Union does indeed impose anti-dumping measures on
Taiwan at such a high tariff rate, the local CD makers will be
severely affected.</P>
      <P>Officials added that many of the CD manufacturers are determined
to see through to the end of the lawsuit and are prepared for a long

      <P>Starting this year, Taiwanese draftees
selected for alternative military service will be sent to Central
American, Caribbean and African countries to assist the Republic of
China's technical and medical missions there.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said Wednesday that
the country's technical and medical missions stationed abroad are

The policy of allowing draftees to engage in alternative military
service at diplomatic missions is one of the ministry's six major
tasks this year, they added.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said a total of 35 eligible conscripts with
related abilities will be sent abroad late this year after undergoing
five weeks of military training and three months of technical and
language training.</P>
      <P>New military conscripts will be able to apply for alternative
military service at diplomatic missions starting Wednesday, the MOFA
officials said, adding that the selected draftees will begin their
various training programs between July and December.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRAFT AMENDMENT AIMS TO GIVE VP LIFETIME PENSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Retired Republic of China vice presidents
might enjoy a lifetime monthly pension in the future with the
legislative committee approval Wednesday of a draft amendment
agreeing with the implementation of the payment scheme.</P>
      <P>The Legal Affairs Committee under the Legislative Yuan gave the
green light to a series of draft amendments to the current law
governing the treatment of retired presidents and vice presidents.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the draft amendments submitted by the
Executive Yuan, retired vice presidents would enjoy a lifetime
monthly pension, as do retired presidents at present. In addition,
they would also be entitled to take part in national ceremonies, as
well as having the use of vehicles and enjoying medical treatment and
security guards provided by the state.</P>
      <P>Although one of the added draft amendments -- which stipulates
that retired presidents will receive a monthly pension even though it
is higher than the monthly salary of the incumbent president -- drew
strong protests from opposition lawmakers, the meeting chairwoman,
Kuomintang lawmaker Yu Yueh-hsia, still approved the measure.</P>
      <P>In the meeting, lawmaker Feng Ting-kuo of the opposition New
Party blasted the measure, as it would grant a monthly pension of
more than NT$800,000 (around US$25,000) to former President Lee
Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Lee's monthly pension would then be higher than the NT$400,000
monthly salary of current Present President Chen Shui-bian, who
voluntarily decided to cut his monthly salary to NT$400,000 from the
previous level of NT$800,000 last year shortly after assuming the
presidency in May.</P>

      <P>The U.S.-mainland China row over the
recent military aircraft collision has once again indicated that any
major event between Washington and Beijing could affect Taiwan-U.S.
relations, a retired career diplomat said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, a former Republic of Chian representative to the
United States, made the remarks in a report on the new U.S.
administration's Asia policy delivered at a weekly meeting of the
opposition Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Chen said the mid-air collision between a U.S. surveillance plane
and a mainland Chinese fighter over the South China Sea early this
month was basically an accident.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, the event signifies that any new
development in U.S.-mainland China relations can indirectly affect
ROC-U.S. relations and the future direction of interactions between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said, the ROC government should make
every possible effort to forge a cross-strait dialogue channel or
mechanism.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, no responsible government would sit idle and
let the current cross-strait stalemate continue.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he is worried that several factors may
adversely affect future Taiwan-U.S. relations, including the current
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration's position on the
ROC's national status, its policy toward traditional overseas Chinese
communities in the United States and the ever changing international
situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said he is convinced that incumbent U.S.
President George W. Bush will be firmer than his predecessors in
upholding the principle that the Taiwan Strait issue should be
resolved by peaceful means.</P>

      <P>Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo
Fukuda Wednesday joined an aide of former Republic of China President
Lee Teng-hui in denying that Lee had applied for a Japanese entry
visa, contradicting the ROC Foreign Ministry.</P>
      <P>Fukuda said at a press conference meeting that Japan had not
received any application for a visa from Lee, despite the fact that
the ROC Foreign Ministry had earlier issued a statement claiming that
Lee had indeed applied for a visa to visit Japan in order to seek
treatment for a heart ailment.</P>
      <P>According to Fukuda, the Taipei Office of the Interchange
Association (IA), a semi-official organization set up to handle
Japanese interests in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic relations
between the two sides, told the Japanese Foreign Ministry that Lee
had not presented a visa application.</P>
      <P>He also denied a news report that the Japanese Foreign Ministry
had instructed IA officials not to accept a visa application from
Lee.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government has been at the brunt of strong criticism

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT RECEIVES FORMER MILITARY ATTACHE OF S. AFRICAN EMBASSY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian told a former
military attache of the South African Embassy on Wednesday that the
former South African official and his family members had displayed an
"incredible" amount of "love" and "courage."</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks at the Presidential Office when he
received McGill Alexander, his wife Anne and daughter Christine, all
of whom were held at gunpoint on Nov. 18, 1997 in their suburban
Taipei residence by Chen Chin-hsing, Taiwan's then-most wanted
criminal.</P>
      <P>The ordeal of Alexander, his wife and their three children
gripped the whole nation after the drama was played out live on
television that night. Chen was Taiwan's most wanted criminal at the
time, having committed several murders, including the kidnapping and
subsequent murder of the daughter of local TV celebrity Pai
Ping-ping. Chen was later arrested, tried and executed.</P>
      <P>Alexander, a devout Christian, said he has written a book based
on that nights' ordeal with the intention of sharing "love" with more
people. The president lauded him for bravely walking through "the
valley of death" and displaying the beauty of human nature.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Nov. 18 is also a special day for him, since his
wife Wu Su-chen was hit by a car on the same day, resulting in
paralysis from the waist down.</P>
      <P>The president added that Alexander's courage was an amazing
display of character in the face of a crisis. Chen added that after
his wife was paralyzed by the car, the couple had to utilize the same
love and courage in order to face each other and their ensuing lives.</P>
      <P>Alexander, who retired and returned to South Africa in 1998, is
visiting Taiwan to attend a breakfast meeting Saturday to pray for
the island.</P>
      <P>The president said that only true love will bring true peace,
adding that he hopes that with the help of Alexander's prayers,
Taiwan will become a place of true love and everlasting peace for
both sides of the Taiwan Strait. "We will not only be the children of
Taiwan," but also the "children of peace," he added.</P>
      <P>The president also recalled that Christine, only 12 years old at
the time, had drawn a heart-shaped picture to express her love of
God, her family and the arrangement of fate.</P>
      <P>Alexander expressed his appreciation to Taipei City government
and Taiwan's people for their love and concern for his family. He
also thanked Frank Hsieh, then a lawyer who now serves as chairman of
the Democratic Progressive Party and Kaohsiung City mayor, and HO
You-yi, former head of Criminal Investigation at the Taipei City
Police Headquarters, who helped negotiate with the notorious Chen for
the safe release of the family. He added that Taiwan people's love
had given him more confidence in human nature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'FULL THREE LINKS' UNAVOIDABLE: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In terms of cross-Taiwan Strait relations
and both sides' coming entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
the opening of the "full three links" between Taiwan and mainland
China is unavoidable, a ranking Republic of China official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>While seeking to promote the establishment of direct trade,
transport and postal links between Taiwan and mainland China, the
government must hammer out a package of related measures to minimize
the possible adverse impacts on local society, said Tsai Ing-wen,
chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), Taiwan's top
policy-making body toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Should Taiwan unilaterally decide to open the direct "full three
links" without adequate negotiations with the mainland Chinese side,
the domestic agricultural and traditional industries would be
seriously threatened, Tsai said. She added that an increased two-way
interflow of professional personnel and resources will also fuel the
pace of local industries relocating to the mainland.</P>
      <P>As the "full three links" will have a far-reaching impact on
Taiwan, the government is poised to promote the task gradually at a
proper time in line with the overall cross-strait climate, she said.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC head, the government will seek to advocate
direct trade between the two sides in accordance with regular
international norms in the first phase of the links after both sides
enter the WTO. The MAC will then move to examine measures to allow
greater imports of mainland Chinese goods and greater mainland
investment in the local service sector, she said.</P>
      <P>As to second-phase exchanges between the two sides, Tsai said the
government will have to set up a flexible security mechanism through
bilateral negotiations to effectively regulate two-way merchandise,
capital, personnel and shipping ties as a whole.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ORDERS DISCIPLINE FOR TAIPOWER DESPITE PANEL'S JUDGEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung ordered that
disciplinary actions be taken against Taiwan Power Company Wednesday
despite a government panel report that cleared the utility company of
any fault in a recent nuclear accident.</P>
      <P>A government report released Wednesday said that the power outage
at the island's No. 3 Nuclear Plant on March 18 was more of a
electrical equipment failure than a nuclear accident.</P>
      <P>The report, authored by a panel led by head of the National
Science Council Wei Che-ho, vindicated the claims of Taiwan Power
Company, which operates the nuclear plant, that the reactor was not
affected by the accident and no radiation was released into the
surrounding environment.</P>
      <P>Although Taipower delayed reporting the accident to the National
Energy Council, which supervises the operation of the island's three
nuclear plants, the company is not otherwise to blame for its
handling of the accident, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The accident took place when a high-tension cable transmitting
power from the plant short-circuited because of damage to its
insulators caused by corrosion. As a result, two generators at the
nuclear plant automatically shut off, leaving the plant in darkness.</P>
      <P>The two backup generators that were supposed to supply
electricity to the nuclear plant in a power outage failed to kick in,
forcing the reactor to fall back on battery power for its water
cooling system, which keeps the reactor from melting down.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, another backup system was hooked up and a crisis was
avoided before the depletion of the battery, which can last only
eight hours.</P>
      <P>The accident was given the second most serious rating for risk,
on a scale of four categories of the riskiness of nuclear accidents.</P>
      <P>The panel, consisting of experts from related government agencies
and two electrical equipment specialists from overseas, determined
that the incident was really a mechanical breakdown rather than a
nuclear accident.</P>
      <P>The panel said Taipower should strengthen the maintenance of its
electrical equipment and power transmitting grid, replace the ceramic
insulators on pylons with ones better able to resist the corrosion
caused by salt buildup which plagues the nuclear plant because of its
vicinity to the coast.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taipower uses helicopters to flush the salt off its
insulators.</P>
      <P>The accident could not have come at a more ironic time, with the
island still reeling from a bitter struggle over the construction of
its fourth nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan ordered the abolishment of the partly finished
plant on Oct. 27, 2000, only to be forced to resume the construction
on Feb. 13 under pressure from the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>The March 18 accident has boosted the anti-nuclear forces'
arguments that accidents are inherent in any nuclear plant no matter
what safety measures are taken.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung was quoted as ordering
Taipower to conduct a thorough examination of its three nuclear
plants in addition to addressing the problems pointed out in the
report.</P>
      <P>Hu Ching-piao, chairman of the Atomic Energy Council quoted Chang
as saying after receiving the report that Taipower and its immediate
supervisory government agency, the Ministry of Economic Affairs,
should come up with measures to prevent a repeat of the incident.</P>
      <P>Taipower was asked by the premier to take disciplinary actions
against officials deemed responsible for the accident.</P>
      <P>Taipower President Kuo Junne-Huey has already stepped down in the
wake of the incident and was replaced by Lin Ching-chi, one of his
deputies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA TO ALLOW DIRECT HIRING OF FILIPINO WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has
finally achieved a breakthrough in its longtime efforts to promote
direct hiring of foreign laborers to avoid the problem of excessive
brokerage fees.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said that the Republic of China and the Philippines
have reached an agreement on the recruiting and contracts of Filipino
laborers in the industry, and will allow manufacturing and
construction firms to directly hire Filipino laborers starting May 1.</P>
      <P>Direct hiring of Filipino household laborers will have to wait
until August 1, because the ROC and the Philippines have yet to agree
on their working hours and wages.</P>
      <P>The Philippines no longer insists that the salaries of foreign
laborers working in industries should include meals and
accommodation, instead leaving such terms up to the laborers and
employers themselves. It is expected that the employers will no
longer provide meals and accommodation, as long as the workers
and employers reach agreement.</P>
      <P>In terms of foreign household laborers, the CLA is in favor of
deciding maximum daily wages and mandated leaves of absence by
keeping such terms in line with the Labor Standards Law.</P>
      <P>The officials said that even if after Aug. 1, when direct
introduction of Filipino laborers will be in full force, the system
will not replace the current brokerage system, but rather will give
employers another option.</P>
      <P>According to the content of recruitment contracts, Taiwan
employers will be able to get information through Philippine overseas
employment agencies, and their recruiting expenditures will be
limited to travel expenses for interviewing the laborers within the
Philippines. Otherwise, employers could hire Filipino workers through
written information in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said that as household employers usually have
no time to select their workers in person, they predicted that direct
hiring will be more commonly used by industrial employers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced Wednesday that the ROC government
was "gladdened" by reports that the 24 stranded U.S. air crew members
in mainland China will soon be released.</P>
      <P>MOFA Spokeswoman Katharine S.Y. Chang made the brief remark in
response to the apparent end to the 11-day standoff between the
United States and mainland China, which began after an April 1
mid-air collision between a U.S. reconnaissance plane and a mainland
fighter jet over the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>However, she refused to speculate how the turn of events will
affect an upcoming meeting in Washington, in which U.S. officials are
slated to decide on Taiwan's request for arms sales this year. She
also refused to speculate on how Washington-Taipei-Beijing relations
will be affected.</P>
      <P>Beijing has repeatedly called for Washington to apologize over
the incident. But the Bush administration has consistently refused to
do so, saying that the blame does not rest with the U.S. air crew,
which made an emergency landing in mainland territory.</P>
      <P>In a gesture taken by Beijing as a sign of its victory in the
diplomatic confrontation that followed, Joseph Prueher, U.S.
ambassador to mainland China, delivered a carefully worded letter of
regret to the mainland's foreign minister. The letter revealed an
apparent agreement to hold a meeting starting next Wednesday to
discuss the incident.</P>

      <P>Government officials are on guard against
the possible sacrifice of U.S. support for Taiwan amid reports that
the crisis between the United States and mainland China over the crew
of a U.S. spy plane ended peacefully Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Mainland Affairs Council expressed concern that
Washington might cool its ties with Taiwan or shelve Taiwan's
requests for arms to avoid further escalation of tensions with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Although Taipei's Foreign Ministry heaved a sigh of relief at the
resolution of the crisis, the MAC officials are privately worried
that Washington might reduce the quantity and quality of arms it
sells to Taiwan to avoid offending Beijing.</P>
      <P>Instead of benefiting from the quarrel between the two powers,
the officials said they were bracing for cooler relations with
Washington in the wake of the dispute.</P>
      <P>The crisis stemmed from the midair collision between a U.S.
surveillance plane and a mainland Chinese jet fighter April 1. The
fighter crashed into the sea and its pilot is missing and presumed
dead.</P>
      <P>The 24 crew members of the crippled U.S. plane were detained by
China after their emergency landing on Hainan, an island in southern
China.</P>
      <P>Beijing held onto the crew and demanded a full apology from
Washington, which the United States refused to issue, contending that
the accident was not its fault.</P>
      <P>The crisis took a dramatic turn Wednesday after U.S. ambassador
to Beijing sent a letter to Beijing's leader, expressing his sorrow
for the loss of the Chinese pilot. Although Washington has denied
that the message was an official apology, Beijing said the letter met
its demands and agreed to release the U.S. crew.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`FLYING ANTELOPE' DRUMS UP SUPPORT TO SAVE CONVICTED DECATHLETE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's veteran female athlete Chi Cheng,
who earned the nickname "the flying antelope" for breaking records at
world track and field events, voiced support Thursday for former
decathlete Ku Chin-shui who was convicted in connection with a
mid-air explosion on a passenger jet.</P>
      <P>Chi, who earned the glorious nickname for repeatedly breaking
100-meter and 200-meter sprint world records in the 1970s, initiated
a "Save Ku" drive Thursday in an attempt to seek justice for the
decathlete and have him exonerated of what she called a false
conviction.</P>
      <P>Ku, who won the decathlon gold medal at the Sixth Asian Track and
Field Championships in Jakarta in 1985, was sentenced last week to 10
years in prison for his role in an explosion and fire on a UNI
Airlines jet some two years ago.</P>
      <P>Ku, who had been a physical education teacher at a junior high
school in Taipei County until the explosion incident in August 1999,
was convicted by judges of the Hualien District Court on charges of
violating the civil aeronautics code. The explosion resulted in the
death of Ku's older brother and injuries to several other of his
relatives on board the plane.</P>
      <P>Former Olympic silver medalist Chi said at a press conference
marking the initiation of the "Save Ku" campaign that what the Hulien
judges described of Ku is not the Ku that she and other athletes
know.</P>
      <P>Chi said the verdict that the judges delivered is not acceptable
because the judges delivered their verdict on Ku in accordance with
the indictment compiled by prosecutors from Hualien District
Prosecutors Office, but without direct evidence.</P>
      <P>She said the verdict is unjustifiable as the accused had no
motives behind the "crime," and the "original scene" in the aftermath
of the incident was damaged by "first line" people.</P>
      <P>Ku is an aboriginal Taiwan citizen from the eastern Taiwan county
of Hualien.</P>
      <P>The Hualien judges said Ku gave his nephew a bag containing
explosive goods, including gasoline, before the latter boarded the
MD-90 jet from Taipei to Hualien city Aug. 23, 1999.</P>
      <P>The bag, according to the judges, exploded when the plane was in
mid-air, killing Ku Chin-chih, the retired athlete's brother, and
causing serious burns to Ku's mother, his sister-in-law, and nephew,
who were sitting near the luggage rack where the explosion occurred.</P>
      <P>According to the judges, Ku had put the gasoline into two plastic
bleach bottles. The gasoline leaked during the flight and exploded
when it caused a short-circuit in a motorbike battery in a nearby
overhead luggage compartment.</P>
      <P>Ku said while being questioned in 1999 that he was originally
scheduled to take the same flight but canceled the trip for business
reasons and assigned his nephew to carry the items that his mother
had ordered him to buy in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Preliminary investigation reports in 1999 indicated that the
blast was caused by two bottles of household bleach.</P>
      <P>Ku, who said he will appeal, claimed that the two bottles did
indeed contain bleach rather than gasoline and that he had no reason
to kill his own kin. He has also alleged that UNI Airlines might bear
some responsibility for the blast.</P>
      <P>Chi said that together with the "Save Ku" drive, a "Save Ku"
support group will also be established to continue to drum up support
for Ku and to appeal for justice for the aboriginal athlete.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NP LEGISLATOR FILES SUIT AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT'S AIDE AGAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator from the opposition New Party
(NP) filed a lawsuit against a confidant of former President Lee
Teng-hui again on Thursday.</P>
      <P>NP Legislator Elmer Feng cited the finding of "new facts and
evidence" as the reason for filing the suit after the Taipei
Prosecutor's Office dismissed a previous suit against Su Chih-cheng.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Wu Chun-li recently dismissed the case filed by Feng,
saying that Su, who acted as the "secret envoy" of the former
president in contacts with mainland authorities, had not divulged any
national secrets nor compromised national security.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee said earlier that he was approached by
Beijing authorities in the early 1990s shortly after he had assumed
the presidency and that he responded to Beijing's offer for secret
meetings by sending his personal secretary Su to make contact with
messengers from Beijing in Hong Kong with the purpose of giving
momentum to cross-strait relations, which had become stagnant by that
time.</P>
      <P>Feng filed the suit with the Taipei Prosecutor's Office
Thursday, citing as the reason the fact that Su had admitted during
the investigation period that he had destroyed all the conversation
records during his meetings with high-ranking mainland officials.</P>
      <P>Feng said that by doing so, Su had evaded supervision by others
and that the move of destroying the records was destruction of
evidence and therefore involved the breaching of national file law
and laws related to the damaging of documents under the Criminal Law.</P>
      <P>Feng said that Su's record of his secret meetings constituted a
major document of the nation that belonged to the people and should
have been properly preserved, adding that its destruction was
"damaging to the public or others."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HAILS POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN 'COLLISION' INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China welcomes the latest
positive development in the incident regarding a recent midair
collision between a U.S. surveillance plane and a mainland Chinese
jet fighter, a Presidential Office spokeswoman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yao-chi, director of the Presidential Office Public Affairs
Office, was responding to Beijing's release of the 24 American EP-3
aircraft crew members after the U.S. government expressed "double
sorry" for the incident.</P>
      <P>"We are pleased to see the incident resolved peacefully
and rationally through diplomatic channels," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Kuo went on, as mainland China has yet to
return the highly sophisticated EP-3 surveillance plane to the United
States, the curtain has not yet completely fallen on the incident.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, various ROC government agencies will continue
keeping close track of new developments in the incident," Kuo
stressed.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the United States has compromised Taiwan's
national interests in negotiations with mainland China for the
release of EP-3 crew, Kuo said she believes that the U.S. government
has enough wisdom to avoid mix-up of two irrelevant things.</P>
      <P>As to whether the incident would affect U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan, Kuo said President Chen Shui-bian had already made a
public appeal for "delinking" of Taiwan-U.S. arms deals with the
U.S.-mainland China "collision" incident.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue
reiterated Thursday that the ROC is happy over an end to the
U.S.-mainland China standoff over the military aircraft collision
incident.</P>
      <P>Chang declined to make any comment on whether the incident would
have any impact on the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and the delicate
Taipei-Washington-Beijing triangular ties.</P>
      <P>Chang only stressed that U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell
has said on many occasions that the "collision" incident and U.S.
arms sales to Taiwan are irrelevant things and will be handled
separately.</P>
      <P>ROC and U.S. military officials are scheduled to meet in
Washington, D.C. April 23 to discuss Taiwan's arms procurement plans
for 2001.</P>
      <P>A senior Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the ROC has adopted a pragmatic attitude toward
the "collision" incident and has hammered out several measures to
cope with the possible developments in the incident.</P>
      <P>"We'll keep a close watch on the follow-up developments in the
incident," the official said, adding that the impact of the incident
on Washington-Beijing ties and interaction between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait can be gauged by several events to take place in
the coming months.</P>
      <P>Those events include the results of the upcoming ROC-U.S. arms
procurement meeting, the development in the Beijing's bid to host the
2008 Olympic Games and whether U.S. President George W. Bush would
attend the informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum to be held in Shanghai in October.</P>
      <P>The United States ended an 11-day crisis with mainland China
Wednesday by saying it was "very sorry" a mainland pilot died in a
collision with its EP-3 plane over South China Sea and "very sorry"
the U.S. plane landed on the mainland without permission.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE YUAN PASSES SUSPENSION OF `THUG LAWMAKER'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan on Thursday
overwhelmingly passed a resolution proposed by the legislative
Disciplinary Committee to suspend the rights of independent
Legislator Lo Fu-chu for six months as a penalty for his assault on a
female colleague.</P>
      <P>In an extraordinary session, 155 out of the 160 legislators who
were present at the session voted for Lo's suspension for six months,
with three voting against the suspension and two abstaining.</P>
      <P>The legislative Independent Alliance, of which Lo is a member,
proposed earlier in the session that Lo be punished with a
three-month suspension rather than a six month suspension.</P>
      <P>The Independent Alliance legislators withdrew en masse from the
voting session after their amendment proposal was rejected 153-1.</P>
      <P>The six-month suspension, the most severe of its kind in the
Legislative Yuan's history, was resolved by the Discipline Committee
April 3, several days after Lo physically attacked People First Party
(PFP) Legislator Diane Lee, which resulted in Lee being hospitalized
with a light concussion and injuries to her hands, neck and shoulder.</P>
      <P>The physical altercation, which occurred at a legislative
Education Committee meeting March 28, began with Lo banging on Lee's
desk with his fist and lambasting her for implying that he had
connections to organized crime and that he was involved in the
alleged corruption and collusion scandal surrounding the Board of
Directors of the private Jin Wen Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>A videotaped recording showed that while Lee argued that she
never named Lo as an organized crime figure, Lo punched Lee several
times and pulled her hair and that Lo's aides physically restrained
Lee's male aide, preventing the aide from defending Lee during the
scuffle.</P>
      <P>On the overwhelming vote for Lo's six-month suspension, Lee, a
former television anchorwoman who is now one of the hardest-working
and most outspoken lawmakers, expressed her appreciation to her
colleagues for passing the proposed punishment for Lo. She said she
hopes that this incident will help eradicate the pollution of
violence from the Legislative Yuan once and for all.</P>
      <P>Lee also said she hopes that the incident is now over and there
will not be any more wars of words. "Now it's time for the Ministry
of Justice and the Ministry of Education to seriously look into the
Jin Wen scandal," Lee added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the passage of his suspension, Lo, who did not show
up at Thursday's voting session, said via a written statement issued
at around noon by his office that he completely accepted the result,
adding that he nevertheless feels that he is the victim of "political
wrestling" in the Legislature.</P>
      <P>Lo, meanwhile, called for relevant government agencies to find
out what individuals have been involved by means of "fraud" or "via
gangland channels" in the Jin Wen scandal.</P>
      <P>Lo stressed that the government must act to unearth the truths
about the scandal and return justice to society.</P>
      <P>The Jin Wen scandal was not brought to light until March 28 after
Lo violently attacked Lee. It has been alleged that several
legislators, Taipei city councilors, ranking government officials and
organized crime figures have been involved in interest-peddling and
collusion.</P>
      <P>Last week, Minister without Portfolio Chang Yu-huei resigned in
the wake of implied allegations of his involvement in the scandal.
Shortly before Chang resigned, Vice Education Minister Lin Chao-hsien
also offered to quit. Both Chang and Lin's resignations were accepted
by their superiors and took effect immediately.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Legislature's Thursday vote in favor of
suspending Lo, the opposition New Party lauded the legislators who
cast "yes" votes, saying that the result indicates that the
Legislative Yuan is still capable of examining itself.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT), the major opposition party which holds the
majority of seats in the Legislature, announced later in the day that
it welcomes the result. The KMT, however, said its legislative caucus
will discuss later whether the three KMT legislators who cast "no"
votes against Lo's being suspended should be dealt with in accordance
with party discipline.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-run enterprises Thursday
called for a pay-scale revision and an early end to salary
calculations based on seniority, according to the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-Yuan, the vice chairman of MOEA's Commission of National
Corporations (CNC), said that China Shipbuilding Corp. and Chinese
Petroleum Corp. will be the first to implement the revision, with
Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) and the Taipei, Kaohsiung and Taiwan
provincial water companies to follow.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that the state-run chemical and agricultural
businesses in Kaohsiung will be privatized, with shares being
released to the public, adding that the companies will be able to
determine their pay scales on their own.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corp. is now discussing
the issue of capital sales to China Steel Corp., which is free to
determine the pay scales of both companies.</P>
      <P>In order to maintain water utility rates, the ROC government has
had to divert more funds to the water companies to make up for the
company's deficits over the years.</P>
      <P>CNC has proposed privatizing Taipower at the end of 2005, Lin
added.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the Chinese Petroleum Corp. should begin
the revision of the company pay scale based on seniority ahead of
schedule and that Taipower should cut personnel costs to prevent
deficits.</P>

in Taiwan. They said that if the government chooses to ease the "go
slow, be patient" policy now, it will induce more Taiwan enterprises
to move to the mainland, making the bleak domestic employment market
even worse.</P>
      <P>Deng responded by saying that the plight of the jobless will be
taken into consideration when the government eases the "go slow"
policy concerning investment in the mainland.</P>
      <P>He said that the timing and scale in which the policy is eased
may change because of the worsening jobless situation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government initiated the "go slow" policy in 1996, citing the
mainland's ongoing hostility toward Taiwan. The policy bans Taiwan
businesses from investing in mainland infrastructure construction and
subjects each investment project to a cap of US$50 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA HAS NOT LIED ABOUT LEE'S JAPANESE VISA APPLICATION: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
not lied about former President Lee Teng-hui's application for a visa
to visit Japan for medical purposes, ministry spokeswoman Chang
Siao-yue said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Despite repeated denials from the Japanese government, Chang
reiterated that Lee indeed has already applied for a visa to go to
Japan to receive treatment for a heart problem.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lee's reason for wanting to enter Japan is very
simple, Chang once again urged Japan not to complicate or politicize
the issue since Lee is now just a private citizen.</P>
      <P>Chang further said the MOFA has kept close contact with the
Republic of Chian representative office in Japan over the issue. "We
are hopeful that Lee's visa application can receive a favorable
result as soon as possible," she added.</P>
      <P>Japan's Foreign Ministry Wednesday repeated a statement it made
Tuesday that the former ROC president had not applied for a visa.</P>
      <P>Chang declined to comment on whether the stark difference between
MOFA's statement and that of its Japanese counterpart would have any
adverse impact on future bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>She said only that the MOFA's stance on the issue has been
consistent. "We will not recall our previous statement concerning the
issue. And of course, we are unlikely to lie about the issue."</P>
      <P>Lee's planned trip to Japan has drawn a great deal of attention
in Taiwan and Japan, with many speculating that the Japanese
government is coming under Beijing's pressure not to grant Lee an
entry visa. Japan switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing in 1972.</P>
      <P>Nearly all major Japanese newspapers, including the Yomiuri
Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun and Sankei Shimbun, have
editorialized on the issue in the past couple of days, unanimously
urging the Japanese government to grant Lee a visa.</P>
      <P>The Japanese dailies said Japan has no convincing reason to
reject Lee's application for entry for the purpose of medical
treatment now that he is a private citizen. They urged their
government not to take political factors into consideration.</P>
      <P>The Sankei Shimbun also reminded the Japanese government that if
it rejects Lee's visa application under a foreign country's pressure,
Japan's national dignity and interests would be impaired because the
international community would look down upon its poor handling of the
issue.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's vocal opposition, Lee managed to visit Britain
and the Czech Republic after he stepped down from the presidency last
May.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. MUST PRESS BEIJING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IMPROVEMENT: GEPHARDT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States must press Communist
China to comply with international standards for human rights, trade
and security practices, House Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued after learning that Beijing agreed to
release the 24 crew members of a U.S. Navy surveillance plane
detained on Hainan Island, Congressman Gephardt said that although he
is pleased with Beijing's decision to allow the 24 American crew
members to return home, the United States must sill press Beijing to
improve its human rights record.</P>
      <P>Gephardt (D-Mo.) also expressed his concern about the U.S.
surveillance plane, saying that "there appears to be no legitimate
reason for the Chinese government to retain possession of a U.S.
plane or its equipment under these circumstances."</P>
      <P>He said that he hopes that the follow-up discussions with Beijing
officials that the Bush administration has agreed to will result in
the prompt return of the U.S. Navy aircraft and its equipment.</P>
      <P>The manner in which Beijing has handled this incident "reinforces
my ongoing concerns about China's lack of adherence to the rule of
law and accepted international standards. I hope the administration
will seek and obtain China's acceptance of international standards
governing such incidents so that we may avoid similar events in the
future," pointed out the congressman.</P>
      <P>Gephardt added that "U.S.-China relations were clearly in
jeopardy over the past few days. I am pleased that the Chinese
government has apparently concluded that moving beyond this incident
was imperative in order to pursue a constructive dialogue with the
United States.</P>
      <P>"These events clearly demonstrate, however, that our ongoing
dialogue with China must include diplomatic pressure to bring about
its compliance with international standards in the human rights,
trade and security arenas," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KEY FIGURE IN NAVY SCANDAL RETURNS TO ROC, IS 'WILLING TO COOPERATE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A key figure in a Navy murder and bribe
scandal has returned to Taiwan for the first time in seven years,
claiming that she is willing to cooperate with investigators "without
any conditions."</P>
      <P>German-based arms broker Cheng Chuen-chu, better known as "Mrs.
Tu," returned to Taipei Wednesday, reportedly to visit her sick
elderly mother.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Tu, who fled Taiwan in late 1993 immediately after Navy
Captain Yin Ching-feng was found murdered, had previously claimed
that she would return to Taipei only when the Taiwan police
authorities could ensure her personal protection.</P>
      <P>Since her flight from Taiwan, Taiwan law enforcement authorities
had met with Mrs. Tu only once, in Singapore in 1994, in order to
probe the truth surrounding Yin's murder as well as a scandal
involving bribery in the sale of German minesweepers.</P>
      <P>State Public Prosecutor General Lu Ren-fa said there is no
question that Mrs. Tu's security during her stay in Taiwan will be
fully protected. Lu, however, declined to confirm whether she will be
"kept" for questioning.</P>
      <P>Lu also declined to confirm whether a meeting will be arranged
for Mrs. Tu and Navy Commander Kuo Hsi, former officer of the Navy's
Weaponry Acquirement Program, "to confront each other for questions."
Seven years ago, Kuo personally informed Mrs. Tu that Yin was found
dead, leading her to flee the country immediately.</P>
      <P>While Mrs. Tu said she will fully cooperate with the
investigators concerning the Yin murder, rumors have said that she
would be "taken in" for questioning.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Tu, who has been living in Germany for the past seven years,
is believed to have been a close friend of Yin, whose body was found
floating in Suao Harbor in eastern Taiwan on Dec. 9, 1993 -- several
days after he had been collecting evidence about alleged
irregularities concerning the Navy's procurement of four German-made
minesweepers and six French-made frigates.</P>
      <P>Tu was the broker between the suppliers of the German-made
minesweepers and the Navy Weaponry Acquirement Program office.</P>
      <P>The four German-made minesweepers were commissioned into Naval
service in March 1995. The four ships have since been operating in
Taiwan waters, disguised as oil exploration ships with crews
outfitted in nonmilitary uniforms. The low-profile operations are
intended to honor the contract the Navy signed with the German maker.</P>
      <P>Yin's murder and the related kickback scandal have never been
resolved, despite the fact that several Navy officers and private
arms brokers have been questioned, indicted or jailed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) announced Thursday that his party has completed all necessary
preparations for cooperation with the People First Party (PFP), also
an opposition party, in the yearend elections.</P>
      <P>Chao Sho-po, director general of the KMT's Organization and
Development Committee, said that it would be best if the two parties
discussed their cooperation by May 5.</P>
      <P>Lin Fong-cheng, secretary general of the KMT's Central Committee,
said that his party will contact PFP staff to discuss matters of
cooperation, and that if necessary, KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP
Chairman James Soong can also meet for discussions.</P>
      <P>The KMT has confirmed that it will not hold primaries in
two cities -- Keelung and Hsinchu -- and eight counties -- Taipei,
Taoyuan, Changhua, Yunglin, Tainan, Penghu, Taitung, Kinmen, and
Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>In races expected to be hotly contested, including Taichung City,
Pingtung County, and Tainan City, the KMT said it will continue to
coordinate matters in the hope of avoiding primaries.</P>
      <P>Chao had said earlier that there is room for cooperation in
cities and counties in which the KMT will not hold primaries, raising
concerns about the progress of cooperation between the two largest
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>On PFP Deputy Secretary General's Chin Chin-sheng's announcement
that he intends to run as the party's candidate in Taipei County's
magistrate election and PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung's change
of attitude toward not running in Taoyuan County, Chao said that
there is a nomination procedure for each party, and that the

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND SANDSTORMS WORSEN TAIWAN'S AIR QUALITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A cloud of dust particles stirred up by
turbulent sandstorms in northern mainland China arrived over Taiwan
Thursday, seriously worsening the island's air quality, the
Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said.</P>
      <P>According to EPA officials, residue from violent sandstorms that
hit Inner Mongolia April 7-9 reached northern Taiwan early in the
morning, and the density of suspended dust particles in the
atmosphere surged to a peak around noon.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said although particulate matter in the air in
northern Taiwan gradually receded in the evening, the island is not
expected to be clear of the influence of the latest mainland
sandstorms until Saturday. Worse yet, they said, dust particles from
mainland sandstorms will begin to affect southern and eastern Taiwan
Friday.</P>
      <P>EPA tallies showed that suspended dust particles in the northern
port city of Keelung reached 380 micrograms per cubic meter at 8
a.m., 78 micrograms in the offshore island of Matsu, 261 micrograms
in Wanli on Taiwan's northeastern coast and 197 micrograms on
Yangmingshan. "All of the figures are eight to 10 times the normal
levels in those areas," said an EPA official.</P>
      <P>He urged local people, particularly children, elderly citizens
and those who suffer from respiratory diseases such as asthma to
refrain from outdoor activities these days for health reasons.</P>
      <P>The official further said local drivers are likely to find that
their cars are covered by a light coating of yellow dust in the
coming days.</P>
      <P>Airborne dust from sandstorms in mainland China have affected
Taiwan's air quality at least six times so far this year, according
to EPA data.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said mainland China's northern regions have had an
average of 15 sandstorms a year over the past half century, making it
one of the four areas in the world most prone to sandstorms.</P>
      <P>The officials further said the latest sandstorms were stirred up
by a cold air mass coming from Siberia and Mongolia and have swept
through the drought-stricken and dusty north-central mainland Chinese
province of Gansu before gradually traveling south and east to Hong
Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, Japan and South Korea.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-based United Microelectronics
Corp. (UMC) began building a US$3.6 billion 12-inch wafer fabrication
plant in Singapore Thursday.</P>
      <P>At the project's groundbreaking ceremony, UMC Group Chairman
Robert Tsao said that his company's globalized management was taking
another step forward by beginning the plant's construction.</P>
      <P>Located in the Pasir Ris Wafer Fab Park, the project is
Singapore's first and UMC's third 12-inch wafer fabrication plant.
The world's second-largest contract chip manufacturer has one other
12-inch plant in Japan and another in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Less than 10 plants of this kind currently exist in the world.</P>
      <P>Singapore Trade Minister George Yeo said at the ceremony that his
country is glad to receive a vote of confidence in the future of
Singapore's semiconductor industry from UMC and Germany's Infineon
Technologies, which holds a 30 percent stake in the project.</P>
      <P>Singapore holds a 15 percent stake in the plant through the
investment arm of its Economic Development Board, while UMC retains a
majority 51.95 percent.</P>
      <P>Yeo said that the UMC plant is the single largest manufacturing
industry investment item in Singapore's history. He said it would
create jobs for an estimated 1,800 Singaporeans and increase the
island-nation's annual wafer production by 20 percent.</P>
      <P>He added that Singapore is planning to develop a fourth
60-hectare wafer fabrication park because its three existing parks,
totaling 200 hectares, will reach full capacity in the next few
years.</P>
      <P>According to UMC, wafer production at the new plant is scheduled
to commence in the third quarter of next year, and first stage
production capacity will reach 20,000 wafers per month. At the end of
the second stage of construction, slated for the fourth quarter of
2003, capacity will double to 40,000 wafers per month.</P>
      <P>The plant will focus on system-on-a-chip products built on
0.13-micron and 0.10-micron process technology jointly developed by
UMC, IBM and Infineon.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese-language edition of a book by
a retired South African diplomat on his family's hostage ordeal in
Taipei in November 1997 hit the bookstores Thursday.</P>
      <P>McGill Alexander, former military attache at the South African
Embassy in Taipei and author of "Hostage in Taipei," said he is very
pleased to see the publication of the Chinese version of his book.</P>
      <P>Alexander, his wife Anne and daughter Christine all attended the
presentation of the translation, which is titled "True Love" in
Mandarin Chinese.</P>
      <P>Alexander said he and his family are filled with gratitude
because they had not only managed to emerge alive from the hostage
ordeal but also have managed to overcome their psychological trauma
from the terrible experience.</P>
      <P>Alexander, his wife and their three children were all held at
gunpoint on Nov. 18, 1997 in their suburban Taipei residence by Chen
Chin-hsing, Taiwan's then-most wanted fugitive.</P>
      <P>The ordeal of Alexander and his family gripped the whole nation
after the drama was played out live on television that night. Chen
was Taiwan's most wanted criminal suspect at the time, having
committed several murders, including the kidnapping and subsequent
murder of the daughter of local TV celebrity Pai Ping-ping. Chen was
later arrested, tried and executed.</P>
      <P>Alexander, a devout Christian, said he wrote "Hostage in Taipei"
to describe that night's ordeal, with the intention of sharing "love"
with other victims of crime in Taiwan and other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>During his more than two-year stay in Taiwan, Alexander recalled
that he deeply enjoyed Taiwan people's friendship, warmth and
hospitality.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, I have always want to do something for the people of
Taiwan, particularly after the island was hit by a devastating
earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999," Alexander said, adding that he hopes
the Chinese edition of his new book can help Taiwan's crime victims
find peace of mind.</P>
      <P>A devout Christian, Alexander said he is convinced that only true
love, not hate, can bring happiness and peace to mankind.</P>
      <P>Alexander and his family arrived in Taipei last week to attend a
national prayer breakfast. He met with President Chen Shui-bian
Wednesday, and will also give lectures to prison inmates during his
stay here.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China agricultural
mission stationed here and the Panamanian Agriculture Ministry signed
a "good seed" agricultural cooperation accord Wednesday to pave the
way for continued agricultural development in this Central American
country.</P>
      <P>ROC Ambassador David C. Y. Hu and Panamanian Agricultural
Minister Pedro Adan Gordon clinched the agreement on behalf of their
respective governments at a local agricultural college. More than 100
representatives from the Panamanian Education Ministry as well as
Youth, Children, Women and Family Ministry were also present on the
occasion.</P>
      <P>The ROC agricultural mission also displayed a variety of
vegetables and fruits at the signing revenue and exhibited a series
of charts, photos and written reports to introduce its work and the
results achieved so far.</P>
      <P>Both Hu and Gordon hailed the signing of the cooperation accord,
with the two stressing the importance of persistent agricultural
development. They also toured a guava plantation operated by the ROC
agricultural mission.</P>
      <P>S. P. Lin, head of the ROC agricultural mission, said they began
providing plant seeds, agricultural machines and technology to local
units in 1988 in conjunction with a "self-sufficiency" plan initiated
by the Panamanian Agriculture Ministry to help improve malnutrition
of poor people in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, the mission has sent out a large amount of
seeds to different local organizations, Lin said, but adding that
relevant Panamanian authorities had not noticed of its financial and
expertise assistance in this country's agricultural development,
given the fact that the service was free and seeds were directly
given away to all in need.</P>
      <P>But due to the mission's tight financial budget in recent years,
it decided to promote the "good seed" agriculture cooperation
project jointly with the Panamanian authorities in the hope of
being able to continue providing its assistance to local people, Lin
explained.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, Lin said that the mission and
Panamanian agricultural authorities will jointly be in charge of
collecting seeds, and that a national committee will be responsible
for the examination of the seeds.</P>
      <P>In the future, all the people who need seeds will have to buy
them at local branches of the Agriculture Ministry, and proceeds from
the sales will be used to set up a fund to continue carrying out the
plan, he pointed out, noting that his mission is planning to
transfer all its know-how to the Panamanian side within three year
to allow it to take in charge of the plan independently.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the mission has set up a seed-collecting and
a teaching center in Panama, which jointly can produce around 1,000
kilograms of seeds each year. The Panamanian Agriculture Ministry
and it also jointly sponsor a variety of teaching and training courses
for local farmers to help them achieve the "self-sufficiency" goal, he
noted.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China government is
considering the timing and conditions for a possible opening of its
real estate market to mainland Chinese investors, an official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fu Don-cheng, director of the Department of Economic Affairs
under the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made the
comment at a seminar on the effects of opening the real estate market
to mainland Chinese investors. Fu added that the MAC is currently
evaluating such a move, and a report is expected to be released in
May.</P>
      <P>Fu predicted that the results of the report will allow subsequent
developments to move in a "positive" and "open" direction.</P>
      <P>In the seminar, which was sponsored by the ROC Council for
Industrial and Commercial Development, Fu indicated that the MAC has
not excluded the possibility that the date of the opening of the real
estate market to mainland Chinese investors could coincide with
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The official said the government decided to open its real estate
market to foreign and mainland Chinese investors during a national
economic development conference in January.</P>
      <P>The official said as soon as the Cabinet approves the change,
there will be no limitations on foreign investment in the local real

      <P>However, he said opening the realty market to mainland investment
would require more evaluation and perhaps some revision of existing

    <HEADLINE>ARMS SALES NOT ON AGENDA OF U.S.-MAINLAND CHINA TALKS ON SPY PLANE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  11 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington's arms sales to Taiwan is
not on the agenda of scheduled April 18 talks between Beijing and
Washington over the return of a U.S. spy plane stranded on Hainan
island, a State Department spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at a regular press briefing, the spokesman
said arms sales to Taiwan and the spy plane are separate issues and
will not be mixed in the April 18 talks agreed by Beijing and
Washington in a deal wherein Beijing agreed to release the 24 crew
members of the plane.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the United States decides its arms sales to
Taiwan based on an assessment of the island's need for defensive
weapons and it is long-standing U.S. policy not to consult with
Beijing on the issue.</P>
      <P>The spokesman's statement was consistent with Secretary of State
Colin Powell's remarks on the issue during the peak of the crisis
over the collision between a U.S. spy plane and a mainland Chinese
jet fighter.</P>
      <P>In a related development, U.S. Representative Henry Hyde,
chairman of the Committee on International Relations and a
Republican from Illinois, said the Bush administration should meet
its obligations under the Taiwan Relations Acts by providing the
island with the arms it needs to defend itself, irrespective of the
spy plane incident.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued after Beijing agreed to release the crew,
Hyde said the incident exposes Beijing's stance and will harden
Congress' attitude toward the communist regime, although its
long-term impact on bilateral ties remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>He praised the Bush administration's handling of the crisis,
which ended with the release of the plane's crew, and supported U.S.
military surveillance flights in international airspace.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China agricultural
mission stationed here and the Panamanian Agriculture Ministry signed
a "good seed" agricultural cooperation accord Wednesday to pave the
way for continued agricultural development in this Central American
country.</P>
      <P>Meeting at a local agricultural college, ROC Ambassador David C.
Y. Hu and Panamanian Agricultural Minister Pedro Adan Gordon clinched
the agreement on behalf of their respective governments at a local
agricultural college. More than 100 representatives from the
Panamanian Education Ministry as well as Youth, Children, Women and
Family Ministry were also present on the occasion.</P>
      <P>The ROC agricultural mission also displayed a variety of
vegetables and fruits at the signing ceremony, and exhibited a series
of charts, photos and written reports to introduce its work and the
results it has achieved so far.</P>
      <P>Both Hu and Gordon hailed the signing of the cooperation accord,
with the two stressing the importance of persistent agricultural
development. They also toured a guava plantation operated by the ROC
agricultural mission.</P>
      <P>S. P. Lin, head of the ROC agricultural mission, noted that his
mission began providing plant seeds, agricultural machines and
technology to local units in 1988 in conjunction with a
"self-sufficiency" plan initiated by the Panamanian Agriculture
Ministry to help alleviate the problem of rural malnutrition in the
Central American nation.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, the mission has sent out a large amount of
seeds to different local organizations, Lin said. But he added that
relevant Panamanian authorities had not noticed its financial and
expert assistance in the country's agricultural development, which he
said was because the service was free and seeds were given directly
to anyone in need.</P>
      <P>But due to the mission's tight financial budget in recent years,
the mission decided to promote the "good seed" agricultural
cooperation project jointly with the Panamanian authorities in the
hope of being able to continue providing assistance to local people,
Lin explained.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, Lin said that the mission and
Panamanian agricultural authorities will jointly take charge of
collecting seeds, and that a national committee will be responsible
for the examination of the seeds.</P>
      <P>In the future, anyone who needs seeds will have to buy them at
local branches of the Agriculture Ministry, and proceeds from the
sales will be used to set up a fund to continue carrying out the
plan, Lin said. He stressed that his mission is planning to transfer
all its know-how to the Panamanian side within three years, in order
to allow it to take in charge of the plan independently.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the mission has set up a seed-collecting and a
teaching center in Panama, which jointly can produce around 1,000
kilograms of seeds each year. The Panamanian Agriculture Ministry and
the ROC mission also jointly sponsor a variety of teaching and
training courses for local farmers to help them achieve the
"self-sufficiency" goal, he noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top mainland China policy making
body said Thursday that the island seeks to purchase advanced
defensive weapons from the United States in order to maintain
sufficient defensive ability to avoid war.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said at an
American Chamber of Commerce China business committee seminar,
attended by some 80 corporate and trade representatives from the
United States, Europe and Japan, that the weapons would help provide
the island with the ability to resolve cross-Taiwan Strait
differences through peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Taiwan military officials are slated to attend a meeting in
Washington later this month to persuade the U.S. administration to
sell advanced weapons to the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Touching on upcoming negotiations between Beijing and Washington
on the return of a U.S. reconnaissance plane still in mainland
Chinese possession after an April 1 mid-air collision with a mainland
jet fighter and an emergency landing in mainland territory, Tsai said
that whether Taiwan's interests might be sacrificed during the
negotiations will need to be closely monitored.</P>
      <P>She added that the ROC government was glad to see the safe return
of the 24 detained crew members of the U.S. aircraft earlier in the
day.</P>
      <P>Turning to the government's trade policy toward mainland China,
Tsai said that although the mainland market is full of potential, the
high risks cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>She went on to say that the ROC government has no intention of
delaying further liberalization of its cross-strait economic policy,
but added that all factors, including the timing and degree of
liberalization, must be carefully balanced against each other.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the process to establish a new order of exchanges
should be pragmatic and gradual.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the government is evaluating various
concrete measures, including the resumption of bilateral negotiations
and the gradual liberalization of bilateral trade limitations, as
well as the planning and establishing of direct bilateral trade,
postal and transportation links.</P>
      <P>Bilateral investment policy and laws related to increased
cultural and social exchanges are also being evaluated, she added.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the government hopes normalization of trade
relations with the mainland can lead to normalization of bilateral
relations.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's energy consumption in the first
two months of this year grew slightly by 4.1 percent over the same
period of last year, due mainly to the slowing economy, government
officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Energy Commission under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), the nation's energy
consumption in January and February totaled 13.93 million kiloliters
and among all the sectors, only the electric, electronic and
machinery industries registered high levels of energy consumption
growth, with combined growth of 19.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The energy-intensive industries such as steel, cement and
chemical materials registered an energy consumption growth of 2.9
percent, 4.1 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, in the same
period, while the energy consumption in the paper-making industry
decreased by 7.9 percent, according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said that while the energy consumption grew only
slowly, the energy supply increased by 11.3 percent over the same
two-month period of last year. They attributed this increase to the
fact that the Formosa Group entered the petroleum product market late
last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many semiconductor
manufacturers from the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park were
impressed by their recent fact-finding trip to mainland China, said
Hsinchu Enterprise Managers Council President Hsu Chin-jung.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who headed a council delegation on a visit Beijing,
Shanghai, Kunshan and Suzhou at the end of last month, suggested that
the Taiwan government begin encouraging high-technology manufacturers
to establish factories in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference organized by the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park Administration, he said the mainland's
efficiency in assembling semiconductor manufacturing machinery is
very high, citing that installation of related machinery can be
completed in 105 days there.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that mainland China is a big country with promising
business potential, and suggested that the government take lead in
encouraging local manufacturers to move to the mainland and lease
land there for Taiwan-owned manufacturing plants.</P>
      <P>Chang Chih-yuan, assistant manager of a semiconductor maker, also
voiced his impression of the mainland trip, saying that he believes
the development of mainland China's semiconductor manufacturing
industry will have a solid foundation in a period of three to five
years.</P>
      <P>Two officials from the science-based industrial park's
administration went to the mainland together with the delegation.
They said that mainland China has a large market with a good
potential in the development of high technology.</P>
      <P>But they added that the political system there remains unstable
and the mainland's ability in production and marketing are weak.</P>
      <P>They pointed out the advantage of engaging in cross-Taiwan Strait
cooperation in the development of high-level technologies.</P>
      <P>After hearing the reports, Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park
Administration Director Huang Wen-hsiung expressed his hope that he
will be able to visit the mainland to see the development there with
his own eyes.</P>
      <P>A mainland trip by officials of his level is subject to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
warned in a study released Thursday that Taiwan would be at a
disadvantage if it were to be involved in an arms race with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>According to the study, mainland China's defense spending is
seeing two-digit annual growth at the same time that the island's
military budget is decreasing.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's top mainland policy planning agency officials
believe that Beijing will continue to focus on economic development
and is unlikely to take the "head-on collision course" of an arms
build-up.</P>
      <P>The study goes on to note that it is still too early to say
whether Taipei and Beijing will engage in an arms race -- where the
mainland continues to deploy ever-more missiles against Taiwan while
the island continues to bolster its anti-missile defenses.</P>
      <P>In regard to Beijing's vocal opposition to the possible sale of
advanced U.S. Aegis-equipped destroyers and Patriot Configuration-3
missiles to Taiwan at an upcoming arms sales meeting in Washington,
the study speculates that Beijing is primarily against the sale
because the two weapons systems are elements that can make up a
Theater Missile Defense system.</P>
      <P>With guided missiles the mainland's "trump cards" for military
intimidation of Taiwan, the study continues, Beijing is naturally
against the sale of such equipment, especially since such sales might

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIALS: NO WATER SHORTAGE IN TAIWAN  WITHIN 20 YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A water resources development program
devised by the government will ensure sufficient water supplies for
the island for the next twenty years, even without building a
controversial reservoir, Vice Premier Lai In-jaw said Thursday.</P>
      <P>After a meeting on the island's water supplies by the Finance and
Economy Panel under the Executive Yuan, Lai told a press conference
that Taiwan is becoming "the 18th country in the world" on the
threshold of a water shortage because of its growing population and
the shift of its industrial structure.</P>
      <P>This looming water shortage could become a bottleneck to the
island's economic development and hinder the sustained growth of the
economy, he warned.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the water resources development program
recently worked out by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) ,
which features the maintenance, repair and remodeling of the island's
existing waterworks, together with the development of 23 new water
resources around the island, will meet the island's water demands
until 2021.</P>
      <P>The controversial Meinung Reservoir in southern Kaohsiung County
was originally tapped as a new water resource. But the project was
put on hold, despite Executive Yuan approval in 1992, because of
fierce opposition from local residents and a boycott by the local
government of Kaohsiung County on the grounds that the projected
reservoir would straddle a geological fault, said Lai.</P>
      <P>Noting that former Premier Vincent Siew promised not to start its
construction unless its opponents' concerns were addressed, Huang
Chin-shan, acting director of the Water Resources Bureau under the
MOEA said at the press conference that the current government has no
plans to start construction at present.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that large areas of rice paddy in southern Taiwan
will be converted to other grain crops -- that require less water --
after Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization, about 100
million tons of irrigation water per year will become available for
domestic or industrial use at the time, Huang said.</P>
      <P>That, combined with the government program, will ensure
sufficient water supplies for the island, even without the Meinung
Reservoir, until 2021, added Huang.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has already pledged to deliver his
presidential campaign promise not to build the reservoir.</P>

    <TEXT>Today is Friday, April 13, or the 20th day
of the third month of the Year of the Snake according to the lunar
calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred
on this date in the past:

1732: Frederick North, the English prime minister who introduced
the Tea Act that led to the "Boston Tea Party," is born. His policies
finally led to Britain's loss of America.

1743: Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States,
is born. He drafted the Declaration of Independence in 1776. His
presidency was marked by the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from
France in 1803 and the Tripolitan War from 1801 to 1805.

1862: France and Annam (now Vietnam) sign the Treaty of Shanghai,
annexing the province of Cochin China to France.

1898: Prompted by the success of the Meiji Reformation in Japan,
Kang Yu-wei initiates a reform movement and submits a report to

(By Jennifer Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Cornell University spokesman said
Thursday that the university has always welcomed former Republic of
China President Lee Teng-hui to return to his old school anytime but
added that there is no information concerning his proposed upcoming
visit.</P>
      <P>Linda Grace-Kobas, director of the Cornell University News
Service, said that the school reunion this year is scheduled for June
and that if Lee plans to visit the university, he should come before
that time.</P>
      <P>She said that the school's long-standing stance of welcoming Lee
to visit has not changed, but she pointed out that the university is
not going to send an invitation to Lee. She added that it will depend
on the former president and that if his application for a visa is
approved, then Cornell University is ready to welcome him with open
arms at any time.</P>
      <P>But she said the university is unaware of whether Lee has applied
for a visa and that they have no further information to confirm if he
will visit Cornell in the near future.</P>
      <P>Grace-Kobas pointed to Lee's visit to the school in 1995 when the
State Department only notified the university after it had approved
Lee's visa application, which she said happened only 12 days before
the visit took place.</P>
      <P>Judging from this, if Lee plans to visit Cornell University, the
school will only be notified shortly before his visit, she added.</P>
      <P>Concerning reports that Lee will present a large donation for the
construction of a new building at the university, Grace-Kobas said
that there is no building on the campus named after Lee.</P>
      <P>Friends of the former ROC president and Cornell
University alumni donated US$2.5 million to establish a Lee Teng-hui
Professor of World Affairs forum in 1994, but there have been no
additional donations since then.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two members of a cross-strait snakehead
ring have been nabbed for allegedly smuggling mainland Chinese women
into Taiwan to work in the sex trade, sources from the Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) reported.</P>
      <P>The two Taiwan men, identified as Kao Mu-shan and Chen Ming-chi,
were apprehended by CIB agents Thursday in the northern Taiwan city
of Hsinchu on charges of being involved in arranging false marriages
between mainland Chinese women and Taiwan men and then forcing the
women to work as prostitutes in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The CIB agents arrested Kao and Chen after they received a
complaint filed by a Taiwan friend of a mainland Chinese woman,
surnamed Wan, from Sichuan Province's Chungqing City, saying that she
was among six women from mainland China being forced to work as
prostitutes in an underground brothel in Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>CIB agents also raided the underground brothel and rescued Wan
and another mainland Chinese woman, surnamed Tsai.</P>
      <P>According to Wan, she became acquainted with Chen and Kao last
June in Chungqing. Wan married Chen in December and had their
marriage officially registered in both Chungqing and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen brought Wan to Taiwan in March of this year but did not take
her to his home. Instead, according to Wan, she was taken directly to
Hsinchu by Kao, who arranged for her to live with five other mainland
Chinese women in an apartment, forcing them to work as prostitutes.
Wan claims that she had been forced to take customers 42 times since
late March.</P>
      <P>The police found that the other four mainland Chinese women, some
of whom are college graduates, were also taken to Taiwan in a similar
manner and were forced into prostitution.</P>
      <P>According to Kao and Chen, the snakehead ring is actually
operated by a man surnamed Hsu, whom the police are actively tracking

    <HEADLINE>NO TIMETABLE FOR ADJUSTING 'GO SLOW' POLICY: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday
that the government has not set any timetable for the adjustment of
the present "go slow, be patient" policy on mainland China-bound
investment.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan plenary session, Chang
said the government is now reviewing the "go slow" or "no haste"
mainland investment policy and evaluating the pros and cons of the
opening of full-fledged direct "three links" across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"The evaluation is expected to be finalized by the end of June,"
Chang said, adding that the government must consider Taiwan's
security and its industrial sector's overall competitiveness. "We
cannot mull the issue only from the viewpoints of economics."</P>
      <P>Chang further explained that the adjustment of the "go slow"
policy must take into consideration cross-strait interaction and
Taipei's and Beijing's accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO).</P>
      <P>"Basically, the 'go slow' policy needs adjustment mainly because
of the prevailing trend of globalization," Chang said, adding that
the timing for adjustment must be carefully chosen.</P>
      <P>While easing current restrictions on the lines of buisness local
companies can legally invest on the mainland, Chang said, the
government intends to simultaneously forge a mechanism for the
return of capital from the other side of the Taiwan Strait and
protect the well-being of local industries as well as Taiwan's
national security and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Noting that the current general international economic situation
is different from the climate seen in the mid-1990s when the "go
slow" policy was formulated, Chang said the policy must be reviewed
from time to time and make necessary adjustment at an appropriate
time.</P>
      <P>The premier further said the government currently does not rule
out the possibility of Taiwan being admitted to the WTO this year.
"But if this goal cannot be realized, the government would not sit
idle. We may delink such issues as the adjustment of 'go slow'
policy and the opening of direct cross-strait 'three links' from our
WTO accession," he noted.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's WTO entry is postponed indefinitely, Chang said, the
government may still adjust the "go slow" mainland investment policy
or open the direct cross-strait trade, mail and transport links
ahead of the WTO accession so long as Taiwan's security and economic
competitiveness can be ensured.</P>
      <P>The premier also defended the Cainet-initiated NT$810 billion
(US$24.7 billion) public investment package, saying that all
projects included in the package were mainly designed to stimulate
domestic demand and bolster domestic economic development.</P>
      <P>Stressing that some of them are follow-up projects in connection
with major infrastructure construction programs launched by the
previous Kuomintang government, Chang reiterated that the
pump-priming package has nothing to do with the year-end elections
for legislators and local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>Chang further dismissed as "unfounded" and "unfair" the
allegations by some opposition lawmakers that many projects included
in the NT$810 billion investment package were designed to give favors
to some local political forces or factions in exchange for their
support for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party candidates in the
year-end elections.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The White House emphasized Thursday
that there were no secret deals with Beijing concerning the release
of the 24 crew members of the U.S. Navy surveillance plane and that
President George W. Bush believes the framework for a productive
U.S.-mainland China relationship remains in place.</P>
      <P>White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said when briefing the press
tat there were no secret understandings reached with Beijing and that
the only issues discussed in the days of negotiations over the
release of the crew members were those mentioned in the U.S. letter
to Communist China that provided the breakthrough.</P>
      <P>In the letter, the United States said it was "very sorry"
that Communist China lost a fighter pilot in the April 1 collision
between his jet fighter and the U.S. aircraft, and that the damaged
surveillance plane landed on Hainan Island without verbal clearance.</P>
      <P>However, Fleischer added that U.S. surveillance flights near
mainland China in international airspace are vital and necessary for
regional security and "will be ongoing."</P>
      <P>White House aides, meanwhile, said President Bush was pleased
that the release of the 24 crew members was resolved calmly through

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SPY FLIGHTS AIMED AT MONITORING M'LAND BUILDUP: COMMENTATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April 12 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian commentator said Thursday that
the reason the Americans are flying surveillance planes along the
mainland Chinese coast is to monitor the unprecedented peacetime
buildup of Communist Chinese naval and air forces deployed against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>David Warren of the Ottawa Citizen said that "it is also the
reason why the Chinese military has become so sensitive about being
monitored."</P>
      <P>This view echoes that of Dr. Thomas T.P. Chen, new representative
of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, Canada, who said the root
cause of the air collision of April 1 is mainland China's increasing
threat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During a recent interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
(CBC), Chen said mainland China has deployed more than 300 guided
missiles in an area facing Taiwan. He noted that Beijing has been
aggressively boosting its military power and intimidating Taiwan
verbally and militarily.</P>
      <P>"This kind of behavior has affected peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region, prompting the U.S. to beef up surveillance in
the area," and therefore, he said, the best solution would be for
mainland China to stop its threats of an armed attack against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Warren said the air incident off Hainan Island was a "symbolic
token" of the real collision between Communist China and the West.
"It is something that has been building for the length of the Clinton
administration and is now just maturing," he noted.</P>
      <P>"The issue, the trigger, is going to be Taiwan, and we ought to
be preparing for it," he advised his Canadian readers.</P>
      <P>The columnist said the West has the entirely false impression
that Communist China's aggressive stance toward Taiwan is a response
to that island's increasing tendency toward independence, as if it
were not already free, and even a response to its electoral process,
which saw the creation of the first multi-party democracy in the
whole history of the Chinese people.</P>
      <P>He termed as "ludicrous" the view that the recovery of Taiwan is
some kind of nationalist imperative. The real and only pressure for
Communist China is its survival in a world that is much freer than it
was before the Berlin Wall was dismantled and before the students in
Tiananmen Square were "barbarically gunned down," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KEY FIGURE IN NAVY SCANDAL TO MEET PRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A key figure in a Republic of China Navy
murder case and related kickbacks scandal who has returned to Taiwan
for the first time in seven years, finally agreed to meet the press
later Friday to "clarify her innocence."</P>
      <P>German-based arms broker Tu Cheng Chuen-chu, better known as
"Mrs. Tu," who returned to Taiwan three days ago, said that she
succumbed to the press only after becoming tired of being hounded by
the media, claiming that most of the media reports about her have
been far from the truth.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh Tsung-min, a Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
adviser, Mrs. Tu, who returned to Taiwan to visit her sick elderly
mother, has not been able to go to the hospital to see her mother
since her return because of fears of being mobbed by reporters and
camera crews.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Tu, who fled Taiwan in late 1993 immediately after ROC Navy
Captain Yin Ching-feng was found murdered, had previously claimed
that she would return to Taipei only after police authorities in
Taiwan could ensure her personal protection.</P>
      <P>Tu was the broker between the suppliers of four German-made
minesweepers and related parts and components and the ROC Navy's
Weaponry Acquirement Program (WAP) office, of which Capt. Yin was
director.</P>
      <P>Although it is widely believed that she is not directly connected
to Yin's murder, the return of Mrs. Tu, a close friend of Yin, is
expected to significantly help police paint a clearer picture of the
murder case and related kickbacks scandal.</P>
      <P>Neither the kickbacks scandal nor murder case has been resolved
over the past seven years, despite the fact that more than 10 ROC
Navy officers and private arms brokers have been questioned, indicted
or jailed. Among them is Kuo Li-heng, Yin's colleague at the WAP
office, who is currently serving a life sentence in prison.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Tu, who has been living in Germany for the past seven years,
is believed to have been a close friend of Yin, whose body was found
floating in Suao Harbor in eastern Taiwan on Dec. 9, 1993 -- several
days after he had been collecting evidence about alleged
irregularities concerning the Navy's procurement of four German-made
minesweepers and six French-made frigates.</P>

has buttressed the threat to Taiwan, militarily, politically and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A real estate leader said Friday that
around 20 foreign institutional investors, including Merril Lynch and
Standard &amp; Poor's, are keen to invest in the Taiwan real estate
market.</P>
      <P>Lai Cheng-yi, president of the Federation of Taiwan Architecture
and Investment Association, said that among the institutional
investors that are currently inspecting the real estate market in
Taiwan, Merril Lynch has made the fastest progress.</P>
      <P>Lai said that Merril Lynch had sent officials to Taichung and
Kaohsiung to conduct an inspection and had selected investment
targets, saying that Taichung should be the first priority with its
brisk business and high standard of living.</P>
      <P>He said that Merril Lynch officials told him that Taiwan's real
estate market had dropped by more than half since 1993, and that this
is the best time to make inroads into the real estate market,
especially since direct trade, postal and transport links -- commonly
known as the "three direct links" -- between Taiwan and mainland
China "will be enforced within a year." By that time, he went on,
many foreign investors will be working with local real estate
operators.</P>
      <P>Lai said that foreign investors will mainly eye business real
estate, meaning office buildings, hotels, resort and leisure centers
and shopping malls.</P>
      <P>As the government is now evaluating the timing and conditions for
the opening of mainland investors to the local real estate market,
Lai predicted that mainland investors will come to Taiwan within a
couple of months, which should help stimulate the slumping real
estate market.</P>
      <P>He noted that mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
explicitly in late January that he hopes Taiwan will allow mainland
investors to invest in the Taiwan real estate market. Lai added that
he believes that as long as Taiwan opens the door, mainland investors
will "scramble" to get into Taiwan's real estate market.</P>
      <P>He said that from a political point of view, mainland investors
in Taiwan's real estate market would help ease cross-Taiwan Strait
tension and facilitate the "direct three links."</P>
      <P>In addition, he continued, the exodus of Taiwan businessmen in
recent years has resulted in the loss of foreign currency and the
opening of the local real estate market to mainland investors will
help redress the balance of capital flight to the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RICE: BUSH WILL DECIDE ON ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN IN DUE COURSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   April  12  (CNA)
(By Herman Y.C. Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. National Security Adviser
Condoleezza Rice said Thursday that President George W. Bush hasn't
even looked at the issue of arms sales to Taiwan yet and that he will
make a decision on the matter in due course.</P>
      <P>U.S. and Taiwan representatives are scheduled to meet in
Washington, D.C., on April 23 for their annual discussions on U.S.
arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a interview on the CBS television program "Early Show," Rice
denied that the Washington-Beijing standoff that followed the mid-air
collision between a Communist Chinese jetfighter and a U.S.
surveillance aircraft is going to affect the U.S. decision on arms
sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I can tell you that no one who has responsibility for making a
decision has even looked at the Taiwan arms issue just yet," Rice
said.</P>
      <P>She said that President Bush is presently receiving
recommendations about the issue and will make a decision in due time.</P>
      <P>"I'm certain that he will consider it in the context of what it
takes to help Taiwan defend itself through the Taiwan Relations Act,"
she pointed out.</P>
      <P>In another TV interview with the ABC show "Good Morning America,"
Rice made it clear that the United States had no plans during the
standoff this month to abandon surveillance flights near Communist
China's coast despite protests from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Rice said such "reconnaissance missions" are part of a broad U.S.
national security strategy aimed at peace and security in the
Asia-Pacific region and at protecting the United States and its
allies.</P>
      <P>"We're happy to talk to the Chinese government about how we might
avoid such an accident in the future. But we're going to continue to
do what is most effective for our national security strategy," she
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MISLED BY PLA ON MID-AIR COLLISION: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A noted American China expert said
Thursday that the Communist Chinese military damaged itself in the
eyes of its Communist Party masters by misleading the government
about the circumstances surrounding the mid-air collision between the
Chinese jetfighter and the U.S. Navy surveillance plane April 1.</P>
      <P>Larry Wortzel, director of the Asian Studies Center at the
Heritage Foundation, said that this may have unpredictable
consequences on the internal power struggle to decide Beijing's next
leadership.</P>
      <P>He commented that the Communist Chinese government will use
propaganda at home to paint the outcome of the incident as a victory,
but he added that he does not see the outcome as an international
propaganda victory for Beijing.</P>
      <P>In the wake of Beijing's release of the 24 crewmembers of the
U.S. Navy EP-3 surveillance plane that made an emergency landing on
mainland China's Hainan Island without first getting clearance,
Wortzel said follow-up talks are critical.</P>
      <P>The United States must insist on its right to conduct
surveillance flights and to transit South China Sea waters. "Rules of
the road for military aircraft and ships operating near each other
must be established and agreed upon," emphasized the former U.S. Army
attache in Beijing.</P>
      <P>"It is important to note that we had such talks with the Soviet
Union and managed to conduct reconnaissance flights and air
intercepts (or sea intercepts for ships) for years with a minimum
number of incidents," said Wortzel, adding that the U.S. cannot
accept blame for the collision and should not make reparations for
either the lost jet fighter or its pilot.</P>
      <P>America's Asian allies have been supportive of this approach, the
China expert continued. He said the countries that have territorial
disputes with Communist China are very happy that the U.S. stood up
against Beijing and denied its "expansionist" territorial claims in
the South China Sea.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA SANDSTORM CONTINUES TO AFFECT TAIWAN'S AIR QUALITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's air quality remained hazardous
Friday because of the effects of turbulent sandstorms originating in
northern mainland China, according to the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>Data recorded by EPA air quality observation stations throughout
the island showed that the density of dust particles suspended in the
air remained at harmful levels.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said that although the particle density had
gradually declined from a peak of more than 300 milligrams per cubic
meter at Thursday noon to about 150 milligrams Friday morning in
northern Taiwan, the density remained at around 200 milligrams in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The officials said the impact on Taiwan's air quality from the
latest mainland sandstorms would gradually recede Friday evening and
that the whole island would be clear of the sandstorms' effect
Saturday, when a cold front from southern mainland China is forecast
to hit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's air quality had remained hazardous since Wednesday
evening when clouds of dust particles stirred up by violent
sandstorms that struck mainland China's Inner Mongolia April 7-9
reached northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>EPA tallies show that the density of dust particles suspended in
the island's atmosphere had surged to eight to 10 times the normal
levels in the past few days.</P>
      <P>Noting that sandstorms are a seasonal meteorological phenomenon,
a senior EPA official said Taiwan is most likely to be affected by
mainland China-originating sandstorms between March and May each
year.</P>
      <P>He said local people, particularly children, the elderly and
those who suffer from respiratory diseases such as asthma should
refrain from outdoor activities whenever residue from mainland
sandstorms arrives in Taiwan's atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Many local drivers have found their cars covered by a light
coating of yellow dust in the past few days.</P>
      <P>According to EPA data, airborne dust from sandstorms in mainland
China has affected Taiwan's air quality at least six times so far
this year.</P>
      <P>The EPA officials said mainland China's northern regions have had
an average of 15 sandstorms a year over the past half century, making
it one of the four areas in the world most prone to sandstorms.</P>
      <P>The officials further said the latest sandstorms were stirred up
by a cold air mass coming from Siberia and Mongolia and swept through
the drought-stricken and dusty north-central mainland Chinese
province of Gansu before gradually traveling south and east to Hong
Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, Japan and South Korea.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ARMS PURCHASES RESULTS PREDICTED TO BE BETTER THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, April 12 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei should be able to acquire most of
the weapons it wishes to purchase from Washington this year, Republic
of China Deputy Representative to the United States Lee Ying-yuan
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Expressing optimism about the prospects of U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan, Lee said he is confident that the ROC government will acquire
better weapons from the United States this year. But he also pointed
out that this does not mean that Taiwan will obtain all the weapons
it hopes to this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to arms procurement, Lee said, the ROC government
also hopes to strengthen personnel training and software development
with the United States.</P>
      <P>At the same time, bilateral Taipei-Washington communication
channels are open and smooth, allowing each side to fully express its
opinions to the other, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in Boston during a speech to an ROC
students' association at Harvard University.</P>
      <P>As to the recent collision between a U.S. spy plane and a
mainland Chinese jet fighter, Lee contended that the stance adopted
by certain U.S. media -- that Washington's arms sales to Taiwan
should be linked to Washington-Beijing ties -- is a positive
development for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Turning to the political situation in Taiwan, Lee admitted that
some disorder emerged in the initial stages of Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) rule. Describing this disorder as some "small episodes"
on Taiwan's path toward democratic development, he said he is still
optimistic that the country will continue moving toward an
institutionalized democracy.</P>
      <P>Regarding the coming legislative election slated for the end of
this year, Lee predicted that it will be a three-way battle among the
DPP, the Kuomintang and the People First Party, with none of them
being able to control a majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Vietnamese officials continued
Friday to court Taiwan businessmen to invest in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>A Vietnamese delegation led by Ho Chi Min City Deputy Mayor Tran
Ngoc Con held a symposium for business and industrial leaders in the
Kaohsiung area at the Kaohsiung Office of the China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA).</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Tran briefed local investors on the
investment climate and incentives adopted by his city government.</P>
      <P>In order to lure more foreign investors to his country, Tran said
that the government has amended many outdated trade regulations and
laws and has signed trade and investment agreements with foreign
countries so as to assure the investors' interests. Vietnam has
attracted more than 2,790 foreign investment cases worth US$36
billion in the past 11 years, Tran added.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that foreign investors who establish
operations in Ho Chi Min City will use local raw materials and only
import if the local supplies are insufficient. The government will
not levy taxes on such materials used for export purposes and will
provide "cheap and convenient" public facilities, he went on.</P>
      <P>At present, some 2,000 Taiwan investors are operating in Vietnam,
behind only Singapore in terms of investment value, Tran said, adding
that Taiwan would top the list of foreign investment if total
investment cases were counted.</P>
      <P>Representatives of Taiwan investors in Vietnam said that two-way
trade between Vietnam and Taiwan has averaged US$1 billion per year
since Vietnam opened up its market to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>They cited cheap and skilled local labor, as well as loose
controls of foreign currency as good reasons to invest there, with
foodstuffs, machinery, cement, textiles and ready-made garments the
most suitable areas in which to invest.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Republic of China legislators
and scholars launched a campaign Friday to urge Japan to rewrite
school textbooks that gloss over its wartime role and atrocities.</P>
      <P>Chu Teh-lan, a researcher with Academia Sinica's Sun Yat-sen
Institute for Social Sciences and Philosophy, told a news conference
that more than 60 local college professors had signed an open letter
protesting whitewashed accounts in a new set of history textbooks for
Japanese high school students to be used from next April.</P>
      <P>Chu said local scholars will cooperate with their South Korean
and Japanese peers in publishing an international version of history
textbooks to offer the correct accounts of major historical events.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, opposition New Party Legislator
Hsieh Chi-ta said she will launch a national campaign urging local
people and legislators to sign an open letter to the Japanese general
public and parliamentarians pushing for revisions to the whitewashed
Japanese textbooks.</P>
      <P>Government authorities and private groups in Taiwan, mainland
China and South Korea have repeatedly asked Japan to rectify the
"inappropriate content" in its new high school textbooks since
Japan's Education Ministry approved in late March the draft of the
textbooks written by historians with nationalist leanings.</P>
      <P>Many sections of the new textbooks give whitewashed accounts of
Japan's colonial past and wartime atrocities, particularly those
regarding the "Nanjing Massacre," in which at least 300,000 civilians
are said to have died when Japanese troops overran the central
mainland Chinese city in December 1937. The Japanese textbook does
not include casualty figures in what it refers to as merely the
"Nanjing Incident."</P>
      <P>The textbook also fails to give a faithful account of many of the
Japanese atrocities committed during World War II, including the
forcing of some 200,000 women from Taiwan and other Asian countries
into sexual slavery in military brothels.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   13   (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung urged the Japanese government Friday to approve former
ROC President Lee Teng-hui's application for a visa to visit Japan to
undertake treatment for a heart condition.</P>
      <P>Chang said in response to a lawmaker's interpellation at the
Legislative Yuan that the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs is
currently negotiating with the Japan over the issue.</P>
      <P>He added that Japan should regard Lee's reason for the visit
"with importance" and grant the visa because it is a decision that a
democratic nation should make.</P>
      <P>Lee's planned trip to Japan has drawn a great deal of attention
in both countries, with many speculating that the Japanese government
is under pressure from Beijing not to grant the former president an
entry visa.</P>
      <P>Lee complained of chest pains after a trip to the Czech Republic
last October and in November underwent successful coronary
angioplasty surgery in an operation overseen by the same Japanese
doctor he plans to visit in Japan for continued treatment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a group of 16 ROC legislators who studied in Japan
announced that they plan to deliver an open letter to the Japanese
government Saturday through the Taipei office of the quasi-official
Japan Interchange Association.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers said that they will urge Japan to grant Lee a visa
on humanitarian grounds and because he is now a private citizen. The
Japanese government has no reason to deny entry to civilians seeking
medical treatment, the legislators added.</P>
      <P>Aside from the urgings of ROC officials and lawmakers, private
ROC citizens groups in both Taiwan and Japan began calling for a
massive letter-writing campaign to persuade Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori and Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono to approve
Lee's visa.</P>
      <P>Major Japanese newspapers have editorialized on the issue in the
past few days and have been unanimously in favor of granting the
visa.</P>
      <P>The dailies criticized the Japanese government for maintaining an
excessively weak diplomatic profile, with the Sankei Shimbun
reminding the government that a rejection of Lee's visa application
under "foreign pressure" will impair Japan's national dignity and
interests because the international community will look down upon its
poor handling of the issue.</P>
      <P>Over 60 Japanese lawmakers came together the previous day to call
on their government to grant Lee a visa. Earlier Friday, five members
of Mori's Cabinet made the same call at a Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>However, Foreign Minister Kono stood by the official claim that
his ministry had yet to even receive an application from Lee, despite
Kono's deputy, Vice Foreign Minister Seishiro Eto, confirming the
previous day that Japan had received a visa application from Lee.</P>
      <P>Noting that Eto's claim exposed his ministry's attempt to avoid
making a decision, the Japanese dailies charged that the Foreign
Ministry and Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda want to
delay resolving the issue so that Lee will be forced to give up his
application.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day in Tokyo, after a meeting with Mori, Kono said
that the prime minister instructed him to "continue gathering data"
on the issue. Kono added that if necessary, the Japanese government
might consider sending a physician to Taiwan to treat Lee.</P>

      <P>A senior official of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday that exchanges between
mainland Chinese coastal cities and Taiwan's offshore islands of
Kinmen and Matzu will increase in the future.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin said that despite mainland
China's reluctance to cooperate, direct travel and shipping have
gradually increased since the ROC launched the Kinmen-Xiamen and
Matzu-Mawei links three months ago.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the MAC's weekly press conference, Lin announced that
MAC officials have completed an initial evaluation report on the
"mini links," which the ROC government implemented on Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>According to the report, a total of 21 direct voyages have been
carried out under the new policy, with the Kinmen side initiating 19
voyages and the mainland sending out two.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a total of 2,374 people crossed to the opposite side
of the strait, with 2,283 Taiwanese crossing directly to the mainland

    <HEADLINE>KEY FIGURE IN NAVY SCANDAL TO COOPERATE WITH INVESTIGATORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A key figure in a 1993 navy murder and
kickback scandal case said Friday that she was willing to cooperate
with investigators to shed light on the case "when time allows."</P>
      <P>Tu Cheng Chuen-chu, better known as merely "Mrs. Tu," returned to
Taiwan for the first time in seven years Wednesday and met the press
Friday to declare her innocence in the high-profile case.</P>
      <P>Tu said that she was in Taiwan primarily to visit her ill mother,
and that time constraints might keep her from meeting with
investigators during this trip.</P>
      <P>Tu, who has lived in Germany for the past seven years, left
Taiwan in a hurry on Dec. 10, 1993 -- one day after the murdered body
of Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng was found. He reportedly had been
collecting evidence about alleged irregularities concerning the
Navy's procurement of four German-made minesweepers and six
French-made missile frigates.</P>
      <P>Although it is widely believed that she was not directly
connected to Yin's murder, Tu's return was expected to paint a
clearer picture of the circumstances surrounding the case and of the
related kickback scandal.</P>
      <P>Tu, who is believed to be a close friend of Yin, explained that
she did not leave the island on her own will. Rather, she said that
she left because Navy Commander Kuo Hsi, a former Weaponry
Acquisition Program (WAP) staff officer who worked with Yin, told her
that the military was "no longer able to protect" her.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, having finally helped Luerssen Werft, the German
company that supplied the minesweepers and related components, to
secure a promise from the Navy to send out a bidding invitation, she
decided to return to Germany, she said.</P>
      <P>Since her flight from Taiwan, Taiwan law enforcement authorities
had met with Tu only once, in Singapore in 1994, in order to probe
the circumstances surrounding Yin's murder as well as a scandal
involving bribery in the sale of the minesweepers.</P>
      <P>Contradicting news reports on her profession, she asserted that
she is not an arms broker. Rather, she said that she had come to
Taiwan to resolve contract issues between Luerssen and the Republic
of China Navy.</P>
      <P>Tu said that she is a longtime acquaintance of Luerssen's CEO,
who sought help from her husband's legal firm to deal with the ROC
Navy's alleged intention of not carrying out a particular contract
with the company.</P>
      <P>That was the reason she went to former ROC legislator Chu
Kao-cheng for help, she said, adding that she was only in contact
with Yin and Kuo during her stay in Taiwan and did not contact any
other military officials.</P>
      <P>She denied reports that she had evidence that would have been
unfavorable to Yin, asserting that most media reports about her have
been far from the truth.</P>
      <P>Neither the kickback scandal nor the murder case has been
resolved over the past seven years, despite the questioning,
indictment or jailing of more than 10 navy officers and private arms
brokers. Among them is Kuo Lee-heng, Yin's colleague at the WAP
office, who is currently serving a life sentence.</P>
      <P>Tu said that she does not know the man but is willing to face him
for cross-examination with investigators.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yin's sister Yin Hsing-wen filed charges against Tu at
the Taipei District Prosecutors Office at the same time that Tu's
press conference was taking place.</P>
      <P>Yin accused Tu of being an accomplice in the murder of her
brother, along with Kuo Hsi and Kuo Lee-heng.</P>

    <HEADLINE>70% OF M'LAND'S IT PRODUCTS SAID FROM TAIWAN-INVESTED FIRMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Beijing trade official said
Friday that 72 percent of the value of the mainland's computer
products last year came from Taiwan-ivested companies.</P>
      <P>Wang Xiaozhuan, deputy director of the Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macau Department under Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, said that the huge mainland market has
attracted more and more investment from Taiwan electronics firms and
this trend "has reached the point of no return."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar in Xiamen on cross-strait electronics and
industrial machinery cooperation and development, Wang said most of
Taiwan's major information technology (IT) makers have move to the
mainland and this trend is only going to widen. The practice of
taking orders in Taiwan but producing on the mainland is also
gradually increasing, he said.</P>
      <P>Wang also revealed that more and more Taiwan computer makers are
setting up research centers in Xian and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>According to unofficial statistics, mainland China produced
US$25.5 billion worth of computers and related equipment last year,
of which Taiwan investment accounted for US$18.5 billion or 72
percent, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang further said that mainland China's IT industry has already
surpassed Taiwan's in terms of production and value, projecting that
the mainland will surpass Japan this year to become the second
largest computer-hardware producing country in the world.</P>
      <P>The fifth Xiamen and Taiwan Trade Exchange Exposition opened
Wednesday in Xiamen, with some 100 Taiwan electronics and electrical
equipment makers and traders participating.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIR COLLISION ADDS UNCERTAINTY TO U.S.-MAINLAND CHINA TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local scholars claimed Saturday that
although "the curtain has fallen" on the U.S.-mainland China standoff
over the recent collision between their military aircraft, the
incident's impact on long-term relations will not recede soon.</P>
      <P>The scholars presented their views on the possible repercussions
of the incident on the delicate Taipei-Washington-Beijing triangular
relations at a seminar jointly organized by several local private
think tanks.</P>
      <P>The seminar was convened to discuss the April 1 incident in which
a U.S. spy plane and a mainland Chinese jet fighter collided in
mid-air, forcing the U.S. plane to make an emergency landing on
Hainan Island and leaving the mainland pilot missing, presumed dead.</P>
      <P>Although intensive diplomatic activity saw the 24 U.S. crew
members released from detention April 12, the plane remained in
mainland Chinese hands and the diplomatic battle to have it returned
to the United States was only just beginning.</P>
      <P>Almost all the participating academics agreed that the collision
incident will add to uncertainty to long-term U.S.-mainland China
relations and that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should adopt
confidence-building measures (CBM) to prevent any military
"miscalculation."</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-yi, director of the Institute of European and American
Studies under Academia Sinica, said he is convinced that the incident
will affect the scope of military exchanges between the United States
and mainland China.</P>
      <P>"And their long-term relations are also expected to become more
uncertain," Lin predicted, adding his belief that U.S.-mainland China
cultural, educational and commercial exchanges will not be affected.</P>
      <P>Lin further said he believes that Washington-Beijing security
dialogue will continue, but that the United States will increasingly
regard mainland China as a "potential competitor."</P>
      <P>"I think that the United States will become more reserved on
anti-nuclear proliferation and human rights issues," Lin explained.</P>
      <P>As for the incident's possible impact on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, Lin said Taiwan and mainland China should learn from the
"linguistic diplomacy" of the United States, particularly its
expression and wording concerning specific issues.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, Taiwan and the mainland should forge a CBM
mechanism in the military field.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, National Taiwan University
professor Chang Lin-cheng said U.S.-mainland China ties will remain
at a low ebb in the wake of the collision.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang went on, past experience shows that
Washington-Beijing ties will continue to forge ahead despite the ups
and downs. "I believe that they will continue engagements in various
fields based on their own national interests," she observed.</P>
      <P>National Chengchi University professor Chao Chun-shan said
Taiwan's government authorities should be more forward-looking and
should adopt a panoramic perspective when formulating diplomatic and
mainland policies.</P>
      <P>"In handling diplomatic and cross-strait affairs, the government
should shed the shackles of near-sighted mentality and avoid adopting
tactics that can only lead to short-lived political gains," Chao
said, adding that the two sides should develop a mechanism to ensure
that they can hold effective dialogue should a similar collision take
place in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL  CITIZENS  SPEND  MORE  FREE TIME WATCHING TV THAN STUDYING: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many Taiwan people spend their leisure
time studying, but watching television remains the most favored
pastime on the island, according to a report on general social trends
released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The report by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) was based on the findings of a poll
conducted earlier this year of about 15,000 local citizens over 15
years of age.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS report, about 4.85 million local people
said they spent at least some of their free time studying or
conducting research over the past year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the report reveals that watching TV remains the
most popular pastime in Taiwan, with each resident spending an
average of two hours and 19 minutes in from of the tube each day --
or 40 percent of his or her total daily free time.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the report said, local people spend only an average
of 25 minutes of their leisure time studying or doing research every
day.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 55 percent of those interviewed said
they watch TV between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. each day; 50 percent said
they watch TV between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m.; and 45 percent watch between
9 p.m. and 10 p.m.</P>
      <P>Poll results showed that local people spend an average of 50
minutes of their daily free time meditating or getting together with
their families.</P>
      <P>Reading newspapers or magazines as well as surfing Internet
websites account for about an average of 22 minutes of local people's
daily leisure time.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS report further said about 28.7 percent of local
citizens use their leisure time to study or do research, slightly
lower than Japan's 30.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Among those who spend some free time studying, 52.7 percent said
they study computer and other information technology-related courses,
while 40. 4 percent said they study languages or literature.</P>
      <P>The survey found no significant gender differences among those
who spend their free time studying, with a 28.5 percent ratio for men
and a 28.9 percent rate for women.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, younger and better educated people are
more likely to use their free time learning new skills or expertise.
Some 58.4 percent of college graduates said they use some of their
free time studying, and 43.4 percent of respondents aged between 15
and 24 said they take extracurricular courses during their leisure
time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR PRESCRIBES HEAVY FINES TO STOP FORGERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou suggested
Saturday that the government impose fines of up to NT$30 million
(US$911,854) on makers of counterfeit municipal garbage bags, saying
that imposing heavy fines is the only effective way of stopping the
illicit practice.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Taipei City Hall has decided to take "abject"
measures to crack down on a recent spate of plastic garbage bag
forgery cases.</P>
      <P>Some of the fake garbage bags look so similar to the ones that
were made under the city government's authority that officials from
Taipei Bureau of Environmental Protection could not tell the
difference between the fakes and the genuine bags at a press
conference held Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at another press conference Saturday, Ma said the city
government has drafted a proposal that would raise fines for garbage
bag forgery from the current NT$30,000-NT$100,000 to NT$300,000-NT$30
million and impose jail terms of 3-7 years on counterfeiters. He said
the strict measures are intended to deter the illegal practice once
and for all.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration has agreed to support a legislative amendment to
related waste management and cleaning statutes so as to legitimize
the heavy cash penalties for garbage bag counterfeiting.</P>
      <P>Taipei City is the first and so far the only city in Taiwan to
adopt a garbage fee collection system, in which residents are charged
a fee for every bag of garbage they discard.</P>
      <P>Since Taipei's new garbage collection system was implemented last
July, the city's average daily garbage volume per person has dropped
to 1.1 kg, compared to some 3.3 kg before.</P>
      <P>The garbage fee collection system, which earns the city about
NT$1.2 billion a month, has also attracted makers and suppliers of
counterfeit garbage bags. According to Taipei City police
headquarters, they received information on 56 cases of bag
counterfeiting over the last several months and have cracked 14 of
them.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday
at a professional women association's national congress that women
should devote themselves to work and actively strive for their
rightful equality in society.</P>
      <P>She praised the participants of the Soroptimist International
national chapter meeting as outstanding women and role models who
show that women can do more than stay home to cook and do the
laundry.</P>
      <P>Women can also be national leaders and can call for the
prevention of wars, said the Republic of China's first female vice
president.</P>
      <P>Former vice president Lien Chan was also invited to speak at the
same meeting, where he praised Soroptimist International, a global
organization with nearly 100,000 members in 119 countries, for its
community volunteer services, which include caring for minority
groups.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang chairman went on to thank the meeting
participants for their support and encouragement during his
unsuccessful presidential campaign last year.</P>
      <P>Lamenting that Taiwan is facing "immense and difficult
challenges" for the first time in 50 years -- referring to broad
economic and political changes in recent months -- he urged the
participants to do their part to allow Taiwan to "stand tall" despite
the difficulties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RED YEAST RICE SAID TO BE GOOD AGENT TO LOWER BLOOD CHOLESTEROL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Red yeast rice, a traditional ingredient
in Chinese cooking, is believed to be effective in lowering abnormal
blood cholesterol level and preventing cardiovascular diseases.</P>
      <P>Health food made of red yeast rice, an ingredient in delicious
dishes such as hong tsao chi (red yeast rice chicken) and hong tsao
man (red yeast rice eel), is now available in Taiwan markets, helping
to lower consumers' blood cholesterol and blood fat levels so as to
prevent cardiovascular diseases.</P>
      <P>According to Dr. Chiang Pi-ning, a physician at Veterans General
Hospital, one of Taiwan's leading medical centers, red yeast rice has
been scientifically proved to be effective in lowering levels of
blood cholesterol and fat because it is rich in the reductase enzyme,
or HMG-GOA, which is a natural agent for maintaining a balanced level
of cholesterol in the blood of mammals.</P>
      <P>Chiang, formerly the personal doctor of former Presidents Chiang
Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo, said the "safe" level of cholesterol
in a healthy person's blood is lower than 200. Although a reading
between 200 and 250 is medically acceptable and does not require
treatment, cholesterol levels should not be allowed to increase, he
added.</P>
      <P>Regular exercise and a well-controlled diet are the best ways to
prevent cardiovascular diseases, Chiang said, adding that even people
who exercise regularly and eat balanced diets are better able to keep
cardiovascular diseases at bay if they take some additional reductase
enzyme supplement such as the red yeast rice pills.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA REITERATES STANCE ON JAPANESE TEXTBOOKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
reiterated Saturday that it has issued three protests since February
over the whitewashed accounts of Japanese wartime history in that
nation's controversial new textbooks, and is now waiting for a formal
response from Japan.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue made the remarks in response to
criticism by opposition lawmakers and scholars that the MOFA's manner
in handling the issue was too low profile.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ministry has consistently paid close attention to
developments in the Japanese textbook issue.</P>
      <P>"Immediately after learning that the Japanese Education Ministry
might approve the draft of a new set of history textbooks for junior
high schools to be used from next April, we expressed our serious
concern about certain inappropriate content of the Japanese
textbooks," Chang recalled, adding that the MOFA's concern was
conveyed to the Japanese government on Feb. 26 through the Republic
of China's representative office in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>When the Japanese government unveiled the officially approved
version of the new high school textbooks April 3, Chang said, the
MOFA ordered the ROC representative office to express Taiwan's
protest on the issue the following day.</P>
      <P>"This time we enclosed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with
our protest letter," Chang explained, adding that the MOU clearly
demanded that Japan rectify certain whitewashed or distorted accounts
of its colonial past and wartime atrocities in its new textbooks.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ROC is particularly concerned about the Japanese
textbooks' misleading and whitewashed accounts of the "Nanjing
Massacre," its army's "comfort women" and Japan's colonial aggression
in the first half of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>The MOU reminded the Japanese government that at least 300,000
civilians are believed to have died when Japanese troops overran the
central mainland Chinese city of Nanjing in December 1937. The
tragedy is commonly known as the "Nanjing Massacre." However, the new
Japanese textbooks do not include casualty figures in what they refer
to merely as the "Nanjing Incident."</P>
      <P>The MOU also expressed regret over the textbook's failure to give
a faithful account of many Japanese atrocities committed during World
War II, including the forcing of some 200,000 women from Taiwan and
other Asian countries into sexual slavery in military brothels.</P>
      <P>In addition to reaffirming the ROC's stance on the issue, the MOU
also urged the Japanese government to face up to historical facts and
stop hurting the feelings of people in its neighboring Asian
countries by correcting the inappropriate content of its new history
textbooks.</P>
      <P>Chang said that as Japanese authorities gave a vague and evasive
response to the ROC's April 4 protest, the MOFA again directed the
ROC representative office in Tokyo to express its stance on April 7.</P>
      <P>"And we are now waiting for Japan's concrete response to our
demand," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC consistently believes that history should not
be distorted, tampered with or glossed over, Chang said the MOFA has
never wavered from its stance of pushing Japan to educate its younger
generation with the correct historical viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Chang further said the MOFA will continue to press Japan to
resolve the issues of the comfort women, textbook revision and former
ROC President Lee Teng-hui's visa application as soon as possible to
avoid affecting the traditionally cordial ties between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwan, mainland China, South Korea and several
other Asian countries have also voiced strong protests against the
new Japanese history textbooks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The China External Trade Development
Council (CETRA), one of Taiwan's most powerful foreign trade arms, is
considering establishing liaison offices in mainland China to explore
the potential of the huge mainland Chinese markets for Taiwan
businesses.</P>
      <P>Mindful of Taiwan and mainland China's expectant admission into
the World Trade Organization (WTO), CETRA authorities decided to
accelerate their move to position Taiwan in the mainland Chinese
markets, which are seen as a "sponge" for made-in-Taiwan products and
mainland Chinese products produced by Taiwan-financed manufacturers.</P>
      <P>CETRA, which has failed in previous similar efforts, will begin
by founding Taiwan product exhibition centers in mainland China, and
if that proceeds smoothly, liaison offices will ensue, said
newly-appointed CETRA Secretary-General Huang Chih-peng.</P>
      <P>Planning to apply for an entry permit from mainland Chinese
authorities under the name of Taipei World Trade Center, CETRA will
engage in operations in trade services only, but not in investment
in mainland China, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Before heading to the mainland, Huang said, CETRA will first have
to obtain official approval from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council and then get an approval from the mainland authorities.</P>
      <P>CETRA, a driving force behind Taiwan's brisk foreign trade
development in the last three decades, maintains 37 operations and
service centers in major cities around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT, SCHOLARS PITCH FOR INTENSIVE INTERNET ETHICS EDUCATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of local scholars and experts
urged the Ministry of Education Saturday to strengthen Internet
ethics education to prevent local students from violating copyright
laws.</P>
      <P>They made the appeal at a seminar on intellectual property rights
(IPR) protection organized by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The KMT said it sponsored the seminar to signify its concern
about the human rights of the 14 National Cheng Kung University
(NCKU) students who allegedly infringed upon copyright law by
downloading music files from the Internet.</P>
      <P>The Tainan District Prosecutors' Office raided NCKU student
dormitories Wednesday and took custody of 14 computer hard disks
containing pirated MP3 files. Prosecution authorities are scheduled
to summon the 14 student owners of the seized disks for questioning
next week.</P>
      <P>The KMT Youth Affairs Department reminded law enforcement
authorities to respect and protect the students' legitimate human
rights in the performance of their official duties.</P>
      <P>The department urged prosecutors to strictly abide by the "secret
and closed-door" principle prescribed in the current code of criminal
procedures in handling the NCKU student case.</P>
      <P>"Prosecutors should refrain from playing up their campus search
and follow-up investigative operations," said a KMT youth department
official.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT youth department is willing to offer counseling
services to the 14 NCKU students to help them ease pressure from the
prosecution authorities' action.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the seminar, National Chengchi University professor
Huang Cheng-chung said prosecutors must be very cautious and prudent
in launching raids on campus or searching student dormitories for any
criminal evidence.</P>
      <P>"They would infringe upon students' human rights if they conduct
a high-profile search on campus," Huang noted.</P>
      <P>He further said Wednesday's raid indicated that law enforcement
authorities have failed to adopt any complementary administrative
measures to increase students' awareness about intellectual property
rights.</P>
      <P>Professor Lin Yi-lung of Central Police University said music and
computer software piracy is rampant in local college and university
campuses, indicating that local students have poor IPR awareness and
knowledge.</P>
      <P>"Education authorities should step up IPR education, particularly
Internet-related ethical principles and behavioral standards, to help
local students avoid violating IPR laws," Lin urged.</P>

(By Kuo Fang-chih and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Republic of China Legislator Lin
Feng-hsi said Friday that Taiwan and Vietnam will continue to strive
for bilateral cooperation in aquaculture so that newer fish breeding
technology can help increase the incomes of Vietnamese farmers.</P>
      <P>Lin, who donated 120,000 mouthbreeder hatchlings to Vietnam
Wednesday on behalf of the Republic of China, told Doan Duy Thanh,
chairman of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, that
bilateral relations have already entered a stage in which the
agriculture and labor agreements signed since 1999 are bearing
results.</P>
      <P>To illustrate his point, he cited the completion of training for
60 Vietnamese aquaculture workers out of an agreed-upon 100 and the
11,000-some Vietnamese workers currently employed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that after the 120,000 baby fish have grown up
in eight months, the breeding ground in Bac Giang Province could
serve as a sample aquaculture farm for other breeders in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Lin added that the mouthbreeders can be a good source of
nutrition for the Vietnamese people.</P>
      <P>In response, Doan thanked Taiwan for the donated fish and the
technical assistance. He also invited the island's aquaculture
industry to inspect and invest in other nearby locations suitable for
fish farming.</P>
      <P>Lin also took the opportunity to urge Vietnam to pay attention to
the importance of environmental protection at the very beginning of
economic development instead of having to look back 20 or 30 years
from now and devote even greater resources and finances to return the
environment to its original state.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMS SALES ISSUE HAS BEEN POLITICIZED: DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen said Saturday
that the Republic of China does not have the upper hand in handling
arms deals with the United States because the issue has been
"politicized."</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks in a radio talk show aired by the
opposition Kuomintang-owned Broadcasting Corp. of China.</P>
      <P>The minister pointed out that whether the United States would
sell Taiwan the highly advanced Aegis radar-equipped destroyers is
not purely a military issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that any decision on the Aegis deal would involve many
complicated considerations, Wu said the ROC must conduct a
comprehensive strategic review before deciding either to buy
Aegis-equipped destroyers or the Kidd-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the ROC's military general staff headquarters
is still evaluating which destroyer should be put on the top of the
weaponry shopping list.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the recent midair collision between a U.S.
surveillance plane and a mainland Chinese jet fighter would affect
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, Wu said the U.S. government has on
several occasions stressed that it would not link the "collision"
incident to its arms deals with Taiwan and would decide its sales
list based on Taiwan's defense needs.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the U.S. government would make a wise decision
on its sales list," Wu stressed.</P>
      <P>ROC and U.S. military officials are scheduled to meet in
Washington, D.C. April 23 to discuss Taiwan's arms procurement plans
for 2001.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said he does not think that a similar
military aircraft incident would happen between Taiwan and mainland
China because the ROC has demanded its warplanes and warships to
maintain "proper distance" from their mainland counterparts.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan would extend a helping hand should a
mainland warplane or warship crashes in the sea, Wu said the ROC
military would certainly assist in rescue operations in line with
international customs and practices.</P>

      <P>Water Festival activities
were held for Thai workers and ethnic Chinese from Burma Saturday in
the city of Chungho, Taipei County, with some 2,000 local people,
Thais and Burmese participating.</P>
      <P>Ushered in by orchestral music and performances of kung-fu dance
and Thai volleyball, the festival formally began when Taipei County
Magistrate Su Chen-chang, Chungho Mayor Lu Fang-yen, and several
dignitaries arrived at the venue aboard a float at 10:30 a.m.</P>
      <P>Upon their arrival an ROC Army Honor Guard performed a rifle
drill, which was followed by a blessing by monks from Thailand.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the celebration, Su stressed that Taipei County
Government has included a series of programs to celebrate the Thai,
Burmese, Lao and Cambodian New Year holidays into its "cultural
calendar" to promote cultural amalgamation among different people.</P>
      <P>The festival reached its climax when Magistrate Su and Mayor Lu
pushed a button starting water sprinklers that splashed water on the
crowd. Water-sprinkling is New Year tradition in Thailand, Burma,
Laos and Cambodia, where people believe the water disperses the evils
of the past year and brings good luck to them after they remove their
damp clothes.</P>
      <P>Revelers at the festival also drenched each other with water
using dippers and water guns. Traditionally, anyone splashed with
water should not get angry, because the wetter a person gets, the
better his or her luck will be.</P>
      <P>A series of programs, including the performance of traditional
Thai and Burmese dances, were also staged simultaneously with the
water-throwing activity. The festival ended at 3 p.m.</P>
      <P>The Water Festival, or Songkuran in the Thai language, is the
most important festival in the four Southeast Asian countries, having
been practiced there for more than 1,000 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT ASKS U.S. TO PROVIDE ADVANCED DEFENSIVE ARMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 14 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
Saturday stressed Taiwan's need for advanced defensive weapons to
safeguard security in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meeting with a delegation of the U.S. Senate Committee on
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Chen said that maintaining the
security of the Taiwan Strait is important not only to Taiwan's
interests, but also to U.S. interests in the Western Pacific.</P>
      <P>As the existing military balance across the strait is likely to
shift in favor of the mainland in 2005, the president urged
Washington to provide advanced defense weapons to Taiwan in
accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and other related
commitments.</P>
      <P>Chen praised U.S. President George Bush for his handling of the
recent collision of a U.S. naval reconnaissance plane and a mainland
Chinese jet fighter over the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>He also expressed his appreciation that Bush had disconnected the
incident with U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen told the visitors that since his inauguration in May last
year, his government has placed top priority on the maintenance of
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said that he has on several occasions displayed good will and
sincerity calling for a resumption of cross-strait negotiations and
exchanges.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is not a trouble-maker, but a peace builder, and is an
advocator and builder of Asia-Pacific peace and security," Chen
added.</P>
      <P>The president said he believes that relations between Taipei and
Washington will be further strengthened in the future because the two
sides share common values of democracy, freedom and human rights,
have common expectations on peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region, and maintain close economic and trade ties.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Chen also indicated his hope that the U.S.
government will relax restrictions on trips to the United States by
ranking Taipei officials and on Taiwan visits by U.S. officials in
charge of security, diplomatic and defense affairs.</P>
      <P>Members of the U.S. Senate delegation included committee chairman
Phil Gramm (R-TX), Robert Bennett (R-UT), Jim Bunning (R-KY) and Mike
Crapo (R-ID).</P>
      <P>They said they would continue to do their utmost to promote

hours and 42 minutes each day in 2000, an increase of five minutes
from average sleeping hours in 1994, a recent government survey has
found.</P>
      <P>According to the poll conducted by the Cabinet-level Directorate

Taiwan area last year, Taiwanese people slept nearly one hour longer
each day than Japanese and noticeably more than Canadians and
Australians.</P>
      <P>At the same time, it also discovered that local people dedicated
less time to household affairs every day, with Taiwanese spending 20
minutes to one hour less on such activities than people in other
countries.</P>
      <P>In terms of age, the people aged 65 or over slept the most, with
an average daily sleeping time of nine hours and 33 minutes; while
those aged 15-19 slept the least, snoozing an average of eight hours

      <P>However, young men aged between 15 and 24 liked to make up their
slumber time by sleeping an average 10 hours on weekends, the poll
indicated.</P>
      <P>In addition, about 83.4 percent of Taiwanese went to bed before
midnight on weekdays, a figure that fell to 80 percent on weekends.
The DGBAS said this is an indication that local people are
increasingly fond of "nocturnal life."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCIAL PLIGHT TRIGGERS DELAYED HEALTH INSURANCE PAYMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yu Cheng-hsien
stressed Sunday that his county did not intend to delay payment for
the nation's health insurance programs, but has been forced to do so
because of lack of county government finances.</P>
      <P>Yu lamented that the finances of Taiwan's cities and counties are
in extremely dire straits, adding that they even have difficulties
paying their personnel expenses.</P>
      <P>He cited his own Kaohsiung County as an example, saying that
personnel expenses hit a high of NT$16.6 billion (US$504.55 million)
this year. He complained that the Central Government recently added
to his headaches by approving a 3 percent pay raise for civil
servants.</P>
      <P>Yu was responding to Friday's remarks by Legislator Lai Shyh-bao
of the opposition New Party. Lai said that as of the end of March,
the labor, farmer, and national health insurance programs have failed
to collect overdue premiums of NT$55 billion (US$1.67 billion).</P>
      <P>Lai put most of the blame for the situation on local governments,
which have failed to meet payments of NT$44.1 billion, or about 80
percent of the entire shortfall.</P>
      <P>Lai said the shortage of money in the health insurance program
will directly impact its normal operations. But according to related
regulations, the central government can do nothing about those local
governments that refuse or delay payment.</P>
      <P>Lai suggested that the government act to revise the law by
deducting its subsidies to local governments that fail to make the
payments, or else by finding other sources of financing.</P>
      <P>Responding to Lai's criticism, Yu criticized the Central
Government as continuing to unveil new tax cut measures without
opening up new sources of financing. He complained that the division
of national revenue between the central and local governments is not
reasonable and only serves to compound the situation, adding that
local governments often find themselves in financial difficulties
because of the Central Government's instructions.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the budget law stipulates that the implementation of
any policy must be buttressed by reliable sources of financing, and
the Central Government can not shift the burden of financing onto
local governments.</P>
      <P>Yu also said that before the streamlining of the Taiwan
Provincial Government in 1999, it had owed around NT$4.5 billion in
unpaid premiums, which he claimed was the reason for the local
governments' delayed payments.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to review the budget for the
labor, farmer and national health insurance programs this coming
week.</P>

without authorization, Tseng said the Department of High Education
under his ministry will talk with the IFPI in an attempt at mediating
the dispute outside the courtroom.</P>
      <P>Noting that music piracy is illegal, the minister called on the
students not to challenge the law by organizing protests against the
crackdown, adding that academic freedom should not be used as an
excuse to shield campuses from judicial procedure.</P>
      <P>However, Tseng added that computer users downloading music
without authorization is a worldwide phenomenon and only recently
have law enforcement officials acknowledged it as an infringement on
intellectual property, so it will take some time for awareness of the
practice's illegality to sink in.</P>
      <P>The dispute was caused by a judicial search of the dormitories of
National Cheng Kung University in Tainan City on April 11 and the
seizure of several students' personal computers, on which MP3 music
files were stored.</P>
      <P>Enraged by the prosecutor's raid on their dormitories, the
university's students staged a sit-in protest on campus the next day,
and threatened to stage an islandwide rally of university students to
condemn what they called the prosecutor's trespassing on their campus
and to demand that the government allow MP3 files to be downloaded
for personal use.</P>
      <P>Not surprisingly, IFPI Taiwan has thrown its weight behind the
prosecutor's crackdown, and has gone so far as to vow to take any
person who illegally copies music to court.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou recommended that the
National Cheng Kung University students accused of piracy settle
their dispute with the IFPI out of court, instead of protesting in
conjunction with students of other universities.</P>
      <P>Ma, who listened to the students' complaints after delivering a
speech at the university Saturday, defended the prosecutor's search
as "not obviously going beyond the law" in technical terms despite
the fact that it was not well-considered.</P>
      <P>The students' claims that they didn't know they were violating
the law could be a strong argument in their defense, said the former
justice minister and graduate of Harvard Law School.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOF TO CHOOSE BANK TO HANDLE COMPUTERIZED LOTTERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 15 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will select
a single bank from among five candidates interested in issuing
computerized lottery tickets starting Jan. 1, 2002.</P>
      <P>The Bank of Taiwan, Taipei Bank, the United World Chinese
Commercial Bank, Chinatrust Commercial Bank and the Bank of Kaohsiung
are all competing to win the rights to handle the new lottery.
Whichever bank wins the bid will then chose a computer company to
cooperate with it in managing the game.</P>
      <P>According to local business sources, the world's top four
computerized lottery companies have already been negotiating with
local companies on possible joint ventures in order to gain a share
of Taiwan's annual NT$150 billion lottery market.</P>
      <P>An MOF official said that the bank that wins the bid will enjoy
the rights to issue computerized lottery tickets for five years, from
Jan. 1, 2002 to Dec. 31, 2006.</P>
      <P>The official further pointed out that in order to maintain the
current traditional lottery, in which players have two chances to win
prizes, the bank will also be responsible for selling traditional
lottery tickets.</P>
      <P>If the new lottery proposal is approved, a player will be allowed
to select six numbers between 1 and 45 at computerized lottery posts
scattered around Taiwan. Grand prize winners of the weekly contest
will receive NT$15 million to NT$30 million, and prize money will
accumulate in the event there is no winner in any single week.</P>
      <P>Holders of tickets that bear three of the six lucky numbers will
win NT$1,000, the official added.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the biggest winners of the new lottery will be the firms
that obtain the rights to handle it. The bank that wins the bid will
enjoy annual revenues of NT$2 billion, while the computer firm chosen
to operate it will earn NT$6.5 billion per year, the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP NOT TRYING TO UNDERMINE NP: JAMES SOONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>James Soong, chairman of the opposition
People First Party (PFP), denied Sunday that his party is trying to
undermine the New Party.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks in the wake of scathing criticism by Wang
Chien-shien, an NP founding member, who said Friday that he was
"insulted" by reports that the PFP is trying to recruit three NP
heavyweights, including himself, to run on the PFP ticket for
at-large legislative seats in the yearend elections.</P>
      <P>Wang also voiced his contempt for NP Legislator Feng Ting-kuo,
who is reportedly considering a possible defection to the PFP camp to
seek re-election.</P>
      <P>Wang said that though the NP is at a low ebb compared with the
three other major parties -- the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
the PFP, and the Kuomintang -- the quality of the NP members is
simply better than any other party. He said this claim has been
substantiated by past media evaluation.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the other three parties all have links with
organized crime, or "black gold," stressing that only clean
multi-party politics can provide a better future for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Soong, who has kept a low profile on cooperating with other
parties in the yearend elections, responded by claiming that he has 
not contacted any of the NP top brass or tried to lure them into his
party's fold.</P>
      <P>Soong said that if necessary, he would not rule out the
possibility of meeting with Wang to explain this to him personally.</P>
      <P>But he also said that exchanges of talent would be good for both
sides, adding that the PFP's principle of remaining open to all
talent from other parties will not change.</P>
      <P>Soong, a former KMT heavyweight who formed the PFP last year
after bolting his former party and running an unsuccessful
presidential campaign, said that the PFP has relied on talent from
all sides, including the DPP, KMT and NP. He said he hopes to forge a
mainstream force in Taiwan, adding that his policy of openness will
not change in the future.</P>
      <P>Soong stressed that an opposition party has to be an effective
force to check the ruling party. Since the PFP has only 19 seats in
the legislature, it does not have such power and has to cooperate
with other parties that share similar ideals, he said.</P>
      <P>Soong also admitted that NP Legislator Feng is in fact
considering joining the PFP at present because the PFP's nomination
procedure requires pre-registration, but he said Feng was responding
to calls from his constituency.</P>
      <P>But Soong said he has not contacted the NP top brass on the
recruitment issue since Hao Lung-pin, former convenor of the NP, left
the party to serve as head of the Environmental Protection
Administration.</P>
      <P>Soong said he appreciated Wang Chien-shien and Hsieh Chi-Ta, the
convenor of the NP, for their support during his campaign for
president in March 2000. He admitted meeting with Hsieh recently, but
said Hsieh only wished to express her views about the NP and they did
not discuss anything related to the two parties.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. State Secretary Colin Powell
indicated Friday that the recent incident involving the collision of
a U.S. reconnaissance plane and a mainland Chinese jet fighter might
create political pressure that would affect U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the Department of State, Powell made the remarks in
Ireland on his way back home from a trip to the Balkans.</P>
      <P>"Obviously, when the environment for such (arms sales) decisions
becomes heated as it is right now as a result of the Chinese response
to this incident of the airplane, it creates political pressure that
we'll have to take into account," Powell noted.</P>
      <P>During the April 1 incident, the U.S. naval reconnaissance plane
made an emergency landing on Hainan Island, while the pilot of the
mainland Chinese jet fighter remained missing.</P>
      <P>Although the 24 crewmen aboard the spy plane were allowed to
return to the United States 12 days later, the plane remains in the
hands of mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government hopes that the U.S. government
will disconnect the spy plane incident from the forthcoming
Taipei-Washington negotiations on arms sales.</P>
      <P>ROC President Chen Shui-bian told a delegation from the Senate
Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs in Taipei Saturday
that Taiwan needs advanced weapons to protect the peace and security
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the security of the Taiwan Strait is important
not only to the interests of Taiwan, but also to the U.S. interests

      <P>Taiwanese businessmen in
Vietnam Saturday asked the Republic of China government to provide
them with loans and help resolve the problem of educating their
children.</P>
      <P>They voiced their appeal at a symposium held with four visiting
four ROC legislators. Hu Chia-ling, ROC representative to Vietnam and
Wu Chien-kuo, director of the Ho Chi Min City Office of the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office, also attended the symposium.</P>
      <P>Legislators Hung Tu (KMT), Fan Yang-sheng (KMT), Kuan Wo-nuan
(KMT) and Lin Feng-hsi (DPP), all members of the Foreign Relations
and Overseas Chinese Affair Committee of the Legislative Yuan, are
currently on a visit to observe the activities of Taiwanese
businessmen in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, participants presented a six-point appeal to
the ROC government, which included asking for the financial help and
educational assistance for their children.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the education problem, participants urged the
government to expand the new military service substitution program so
as to allow conscripts to assist in overseas education for Taiwanese
students and to help teachers at overseas Chinese schools secure jobs
when they return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They also asked the government agencies concerned to change the
current eight-year limitation for overseas Chinese students to enjoy
the privilege of studying in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They also asked the ROC to establish a foundation jointly
invested by Taiwan's universities and enterprises and operated by
Taiwanese businessmen in Southeast Asia that would offer scholarships
for Southeast Asian students to study in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, participants also blasted Eva Airways and
China Airlines for their high air ticket prices. They urged Eva and
CAL to cut their air ticket prices to the same level as those charged
by Vietnam Airlines.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Feng-hsi (DPP) agreed that it is unfair that Eva
Airways and China Airlines charge 20 percent more than Vietnam
Airlines, adding that he would like to lead the businessmen in a
protest in front of the Taipei headquarters of both Eva Air and CAL,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>The trip will also bring the four legislators to Cambodia and

      <P>Credit cards spending in the Taiwan area
set a new high of NT$719.8 billion (about US$22 billion) in 2000, up
20.1 percent from the 1999 level, the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>About NT$660 billion of the figure was spent at home, a 21.1
percent from last year, while the remaining NT$59 billion was spent
abroad, up 13.2 percent from a year ago, according to DGBAS
statistics.</P>
      <P>As of the end of 2000, a record high of 32.42 million credit
cards had been issued in Taiwan, up 36 percent on a year-to-year
basis, and some 18.28 million credit cards were in active
circulation, representing an annual increase of 34.6 percent.</P>
      <P>With the Taiwan people increasingly getting used to spending with
credit cards, the number of credit card transactions grew by 31.9
percent to total 272.28 million, the DGBAS said. The average
transaction value was NT$2,643, a decrease of 8.7 percent from the
1999 average level, it added.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS tallies, Taiwan's credit card spending
accounted for 12 percent of private sector consumption in 2000, up
1.4 percentage points from the 1999 ratio. In addition, Taiwan's
savings rate stood at 25.2 percent last year, lower than the 26.7

Justice Ministry consultant Hsieh Tsung-min.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who had accompanied Mrs. Tu since her arrival in Taipei

      <P>In addition to meeting with the investigators, Mrs. Tu also had a

      <P>After that, she traveled to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
and left the country aboard a Cathay Pacific flight in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>Yin was murdered in 1993, a crime apparently connected with a

      <P>Taiwan would understand if Washington
rejects its request for the purchase of destroyers equipped with
advanced Aegis battle management radar systems, according to the
Republic of China foreign minister.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the San Jose Mercury News, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao said it will not be the end of the
world if Taiwan's request for four Aegis-equipped Arleigh Burke-class
destroyers is denied, since other weaponry can also be used to
counter Beijing's military buildup.</P>
      <P>Noting that his statement will ease pressure on the Bush
administration amid its ongoing dispute with Beijing over a U.S. spy
plane, the paper quoted Tien as saying that Taiwan would understand
if Washington decides not to sell it the destroyers because of
possible negative reactions by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Given the great importance of the ROC's friendship with the
United States, it would be unwise to damage the relationship over
weapons sales, Tien pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan knows that Washington might not grant its every request
for arms, and would take it in stride if its requests are not fully
met, Tien said.</P>
      <P>Tien also said Taiwan would welcome the establishment of a
mechanism between Taiwan and mainland China to enable the two sides
to communicate with each other in case of accidents involving pilots
or sailors from either side.</P>
      <P>In light of the lingering tension in the Taiwan Strait caused by
the collision of a U.S. spy plane and a mainland Chinese jet fighter
over the South China Sea on April 1, a mechanism of communication is
vital to ensure that any accident involving Taiwan and mainland China
would not get out of control, Tien was quoted as saying.</P>

nobody doubts that women are able to manage family affairs and women

      <P>Lu, a champion of women's rights in Taiwan, made the remarks when

Associations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some 60 women's associations across Taiwan have joined together
to form the confederation with the aim of promoting women's rights
and interests as well as equality of the sexes.</P>
      <P>Lu pointed out that in the past, women were regarded as
second-class citizens. "How pitiful are we?" Lu asked rhetorically.
"We should substitute competition with cooperation."</P>
      <P>In the past, women were accustomed to being led by men but now
women should accustom themselves to being independent, she said,
adding that women have ability to distinguish the right path from the
wrong one.</P>
      <P>She stressed that since men do not doubt women's ability to

      <P>Crowds of Thai workers and local people
came together to celebrate Southeast Asia's New Year Water Festival,
or Songkran in the Thai language, in Kaohsiung City and Taoyuan
County Sunday.</P>
      <P>Upon their arrival at the celebrations in Kaohsiung, Mayor Frank
Hsieh and Fang Lai-chin, director of Bureau of Labor Affairs, were
immediately smeared with white powder and drenched in water by Thai
laborers as a gesture of good luck.</P>
      <P>Noting that Kaohsiung's Nan-tzu area boasts the majority of Thai
laborers in Taiwan, Hsieh said the celebration of Songkran in this
city is very significant. He said that anyone who rejects getting
covered in white powder and water in the festival rejects luck, as
Thai people believe that getting drenched in water disperses the
evils of the past year and brings good luck to them.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Water Festival, which falls on April 13-15 this
year, is the New Year tradition in Thailand, Fang said that Kaohsiung
City Government's sponsorship of the festivities with the
participation of local residents is aimed at alleviating cultural
misunderstandings among the different peoples and reducing the Thai
laborers' homesickness.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some 30,000 Thai laborers in Taoyuan County descended
on Taoyuan Stadium for water-throwing as well as a beauty pageant and
other activities sponsored by the county government.</P>
      <P>The organizers invited Thai monks to chant Buddhist scriptures,
and an international Thai dance group put on a performance. But the
festival reached its climax with the beauty pageant, in which the
winner was determined by the number of balloons received from
spectators as well as her answers to judges' questions.</P>
      <P>After a fierce one-hour contest, the winner went to a Thai girl
of Chinese descent who works in a foreign labor brokerage company in
Taipei. She received a prize of NT$15,000 (US$460).</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan Fire Department also participated in the festival,

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT DISPUTES SPECULATION ABOUT HIS TRIP TO JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui reiterated
Sunday that he wants to visit Japan solely to see a cardiologist for
his heart condition, and not for any political purpose.</P>
      <P>In his first press conference since he stepped down last May, Lee
disputed speculation that he wants to visit Japan in order to thumb
his nose at Beijing, which has been trying to prevent him from making
the trip even though he is no longer Taiwan's leader and has no
official role in its government.</P>
      <P>Lee said he is slated to visit the United States in May and would
like to have his heart thoroughly checked in Japan before his U.S.
journey.</P>
      <P>The former president said his heart disorder dates back to 1972,
adding that his condition deteriorated in 1999, when the island was
hit by a 7.3-magnitute earthquake. The same year's presidential
election campaign further taxed his health when he took to stumping
for his protege Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan, sometimes seven times
a day, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee recalled that he could hardly walk a hundred steps without a
break last May when he visited Britain after leaving office.</P>
      <P>Although he underwent a coronary angioplasty in October last year
to open a narrowed coronary artery, his condition has not improved
much. He still feels chest pain and has to take medicine three times
a day, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Japanese cardiologist Kazuaki Mitsuto is a specialist
in this disease, Lee said he would like to see him for treatment.</P>
      <P>He confirmed that his application for a visa was presented to the
Japanese representative office in Taipei on April 10.</P>
      <P>Lee revealed that he will go to Cornell University in upstate New
York on May 4 to attend the ground-breaking ceremony for a
nanotechnology laboratory named after him.</P>
      <P>An alumnus of Cornell University, Lee visited the school in 1996
while serving as president of the Republic of China despite Beijing's
painstaking attempts to block his visit. Lee said that visit was a
culmination of his longtime efforts to enhance the island's
international profile.</P>
      <P>Lee's Sunday statement will inevitably turn up the heat on
Japanese leaders, who are currently divided over how to handle Lee's
visa application.</P>
      <P>As an illustration of the dilemma, the four candidates for head
of Japan's ruling Liberty Democracy Party (LDP) were split evenly
over whether the government should grant Lee a visa when they
appeared in a televised interview Sunday.</P>
      <P>Shizuka Kamei, chairman of the LDP Party Policy Research Council,
said there is no reason to turn down Lee's application. He demanded
the removal of current Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and Cabinet
Secretary Yasuo Fukuda, who oppose Lee's visit out of concerns over
arousing Beijing's anger.</P>
      <P>Another candidate, Taro Aso, said Lee is entitled to a visa on
humanitarian grounds.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Ryutaro Hashimoto, leader of the biggest faction within
the LDP and Junichiro Koizumi, the former leader of the second
biggest LDP faction, expressed reservations on the issue.</P>
      <P>Hashimoto said Taiwan and mainland China should not take their
dispute to Japan, and Tokyo should carefully steer clear of the
Taipei-Beijing quarrel.</P>
      <P>Koizumi said the issue should be resolved after considering the
overall three-way ties between Beijing, Taipei and Tokyo.</P>

      <P>The family of a mainland Chinese molecular science
researcher who has been in a coma since being hit by a car in Taipei
last year is now in desperate need of help to cover his extensive
medical bills, a New Party legislator said Monday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese physicist Zhang Jingmin, who came to Taiwan last
July under a short-term algae spectrology-photosynthesis research
program financed by the Academia Sinica's Institute of Atomic and
Molecular Sciences, was hit by a drunk driver Oct. 14 while riding
his bicycle home near the Academia Sinica's dormitory in Nankang, a
suburb Taipei.</P>
      <P>Sustaining serious injuries to his head, Zhang has been in a coma
ever since the accident, according to New Party Legislator Elmer
Feng, who accompanied Zhang's wife and daughter at a press conference
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Feng called on the Taiwan public to extend humanitarian help to
Zhang and his family, who are now facing grave psychological and
financial difficulties in the wake of the accident.</P>
      <P>According to Feng, Academia Sinica's management did not arrange
any insurance policies for Zhang and his family on the grounds that
Zhang was only in Taiwan for a short-term stay. Without National
Health Insurance policy coverage, Zhang's wife needs a huge sum of
money to foot Zhang's medical bills, Feng noted.</P>

current quandary is a shortage of financial resources.</P>
      <P>While introducing Taipei's rapid transit system, Internet

Antonvich and accompanying officials from Los Angeles County cities
that Taipei's annual infrastructure budget last year showed its
greatest negative growth in the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>Ma added that the budget decrease was the result of the central
government's downward revision of Taipei's budget allotment and also
due to Taiwan's overall economic sluggishness. He also speculated

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PREZ LEE INVITED BY CANADIAN CITY ON MEMORIAL OF MACKAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui has been invited by a Canadian city to attend a
ribbon-cutting ceremony marking the establishment of a monument to
Dr. George Leslie Mackay, a doctor-missionary who died in Taiwan 100
years ago.</P>
      <P>Mayor John Geoghegan of the city of Woodstock, Ontario, has sent
an invitation to Lee, inviting him to attend a ceremony slated for
June 2 in Zorra Village in Ontario's Oxford County, marking the
establishment of a monument to Mackay, founder of the Mackay Memorial
Hospital, one of the most prestigious hospitals in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to sources from Toronto's Presbyterian Church,
Woodstock decided to invite the former ROC president to Canada based
on at least three reasons -- that President Lee Teng-hui is an alumna
of Tamkang High School in Tamshui, Taipei county, a school
established by Mackay more than 110 years ago; that Lee is now a
resident of Tamshui, a coastal township that Mackay spent most of his
years in Taiwan in from 1872; and that Lee is a devout member of the
Presbyterian Church, of which Mackay was a missionary.</P>
      <P>In addition, the sources said, the first hospital that Mackay
established in Taiwan was located in Tamshui. Still standing and
operating is Oxford College, located near Tamkang High School in the
hilly Tamshui, established by Mackay in memory of his Canadian
hometown of Oxford County.</P>
      <P>Whether Lee will be able to make the time in his tight schedule
to visit Canada in early June remains to be seen, the sources from
Toronto Presbyterian Church said. They added that the likelihood of
him visiting will increase if Lee's plan to visit Cornell University
in the United States in May proceeds smoothly.</P>
      <P>A Toronto overseas Chinese community leader said that although
Canada firmly recognizes the "one China" policy, Canadian authorities
should not have any reason to not grant an entry visa to Lee, now a
private citizen who holds no official government posts.</P>
      <P>Dr. George Leslie Mackay came to Taiwan in 1872 at the age of 28
as a missionary from the Canadian Presbyterian Church. He preached,
educated and provided medical services to the people of Taiwan
throughout his 29 years in Taiwan until he passed away in 1901 in
Tamshui. His grave is located at Oxford College in Tamshui.</P>
      <P>Mackay married a Taiwan woman with whom he had several offspring
whom are now living in Canada or Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tamkang High School, Mackay Memorial Hospital and other
establishments related to Mackay in Taiwan are also planning to hold
similar activities in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of
MacKay's death, which falls on June 2, a Mackay hospital spokeswoman
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY UNVEILS NOMINATION LIST FOR TAIPEI'S SOUTHERN DISTRICT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The tiny opposition New Party announced
Monday that it will field three candidates in metropolitan Taipei's
southern constituency for the yearend parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>Two of the nominees are incumbent Legislators Lai Shyh-bao and
Elmer Feng and the third is incumbent Taipei City Council member Chin
Li-fang, according to New Party Convener Hsieh Chi-ta's press
conference announcement.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, herself an incumbent legislator, said all three candidates
have individual styles and different support bases. "As their 'vote
banks' do not overlap, we have decided to nominate all of them to run
in the yearend elections," she noted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that although the New Party has encountered several
setbacks recently, such as the "defection" of New Party Legislator
Feng Ting-kuo to the opposition People First Party (PFP), all party
members and supporters maintain a strong consensus and are focused on
winning as many Legislative Yuan seats as possible.</P>
      <P>Both the New Party and the PFP are splinter groups from the main
opposition Kuomintang, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until last May
and still controls a comfortable majority in the Legislative Yuan.
The New Party has seen its popular support dwindling in favor of the
PFP since the latter party was founded last year. The New Party is
the only domestic political party that unequivocally advocates
unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The New Party must garner at least 5 percent of the votes cast in
the regional legislative elections to qualify for securing at-large
legislative seats. "We are confident that our party will be able to
attain this goal," said Hsieh, a judge-turned-lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Asked whether she would meet with PFP Chairman James Soong to
discuss a recent squabble between the two parties over a report that
the PFP plans to "recruit" three New Party stalwarts to run on its
ticket for at-large legislative seats, Hsieh said the New Party is
not in a position to take any initiative on the issue.</P>
      <P>"My top priority at the moment is to focus our party affairs on
consolidating our grass-roots support," stressed Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report that the PFP is planning to "draft"
incumbent independent lawmaker Chu Hui-liang to run on its ticket for
a regional legislative seat in the Hsinchu City constituency, Hsieh
said if Chu really accepts such an offer, she will wish the
legislator success.</P>
      <P>The New Party expelled Chu from its ranks after she ran for the
vice presidency as the running mate of independent candidate Hsu
Hsin-liang in last year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the New Party has several members who are very
qualified to run in the Hsinchu constituency. "We have full
confidence that we will win at least one seat in that district," she
added.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has
proposed that insurance for all visiting academics, scholars and
specialists from mainland China be made mandatory for the period of
their stay in Taiwan, a MAC official said Monday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung said at a meeting of the
Legislative Yuan Interior and Ethnic Affairs Committee that he is
gravely concerned about the situation of mainland Chinese molecular
science researcher Zhang Jingmin, who is now lying comatose on a
Taipei hospital bed after being hit by a car in Taipei last year.</P>
      <P>To express his concern, Chen said he will donate 10 days' of his
own salary to Zhang's family in an effort he described as "casting a
brick to attract jade" -- or making a gesture to encourage more
people to extend humanitarian help to Zhang and his family, who are
now facing grave psychological and financial difficulties in the wake
of the accident.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who came to Taiwan last July under a short-term algae
spectrology-photosynthesis research program financed by Academia
Sinica's Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, was hit by a
drunk driver Oct. 14 while riding his bicycle home near the Academia
Sinica dormitory in Nankang, a suburb Taipei.</P>
      <P>Zhang sustained serious injuries to his head and has been in a
coma ever since the accident, according to New Party Legislator Elmer
Feng, who held a press conference on the issue Sunday along with
Zhang's wife and daughter.</P>
      <P>Feng brought the Zhang case to the legislative Interior and
Ethnic Affairs Committee Monday for discussion, during which MAC
official Chen noted that his agency has already submitted a proposal
to the Executive Yuan demanding that all mainland Chinese academics,
scholars and specialists be covered under insurance policies while
they are visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the MAC will also contact relevant officials from
Academia Sinica in the hope that Zhang's case will be handled more
soundly.</P>
      <P>In response to Feng's criticism that Academia Sinica's management
had failed to arrange insurance for Zhang and his family on the
grounds that they were only in Taiwan for a short-term stay, Academia
Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh said the institute's General Affairs
Department has done all it can to help Zhang in the wake of the
accident. Lee denied that Academia Sinica has ignored or neglected
the matter.</P>
      <P>Feng said that without National Health Insurance coverage or any
other private insurance, Zhang's wife now needs a huge sum of money
to cover his medical bills from Tri Service General Hospital, where
he is still comatose.</P>
      <P>Zhang, whose research program expired at the end of 2000, was hit
by a Taipei man identified as Lin Chang-kuo, who was driving a car
while intoxicated on the night of Oct. 14. The police have as yet
failed to track down him.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TASK FORCE MEETS TO DISCUSS MP3 DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An intra-government agency task force said
Monday that it will sort out the problems arising from the university
students charged with downloading music files from the Internet
before contacting the International Federation of the Phonographic
Industry, Taiwan (IFPI).</P>
      <P>The task force was formed at the instruction of Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung who expressed concern about last Wednesday's move by the
Tainan Prosecutors' Office to search a National Cheng Kung University
student dormitory and seize several computers on which MP3 music
files were stored.</P>
      <P>The task force participants agreed on several resolutions during
the meeting. They suggested that colleges and universities form
emergency teams to contact the Judicial Ministry, the Executive Yuan
form a task force to deal with piracy and the practice of
downloading, the Education Ministry establish a legal counseling
team, and campuses increase their education on the protection of
intellectual property rights (IPRs).</P>
      <P>Vice Education Minister Fan Hsun-lu, presiding over the first
meeting, said that the public should respect intellectual property
rights, adding that her ministry will step up its IPR awareness
campaign so that the students will be aware of the regulations.</P>
      <P>She said that students, while free to exercise their rights on
the Net, should not forget their self-discipline, adding that
Education Minister Ovid Tseng will write an open letter to Taiwan's
university students on the subject.</P>
      <P>Fan said that IFPI had provided a "blacklist" of 45 illegal sites
on university computer systems from which students could download MP3
digital music files, of which 25 had been shut down. She added that
the ministry will investigate the remaining sites.</P>
      <P>In light of the MP3 controversy, the ministry has invited
National Cheng Kung University President Kao Chiang and the school's
Student Association president for a briefing. She said that as long
as the school thinks it can handle the case, the ministry will only
provide assistance, but otherwise the ministry will contact the IFPI
after sorting out the dispute.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Government Information Office, Justice
Ministry, Information Industry Institute, and Taiwan Bar Association
also attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Hsiao Hsiung-lin, an IPR expert at the Taiwan Bar
Association, said that the association will discuss whether the
search of the school campus was itself legal and whether downloading
digitized information for personal use violates the law.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as the incident unleashed a heated online and
campus-wide debate, the 14 students whose computers were seized by
the Tainan Prosecutors' Office issued a joint statement through the
Students' Association Monday, stressing that they had absolutely no
intention of burning the downloaded MP3 files onto CD-ROMs to sell
for profit.</P>
      <P>The Students' Association also appealed for the IFPI to refrain
from filing suits against the students.</P>
      <P>The 14 students said that from the moment the prosecutors entered
the dormitory, National Cheng Kung University has been in the
limelight. The media reports had misled the public, the reputation of
the school has been tainted, and they have lived under the shadow of
fear, they lamented.</P>
      <P>They swore that they did not engage in online piracy for profit,
adding that reports about prosecutors "catching them red-handed" were
"ridiculous." They asked for full support and assistance from the
public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POSSIBLE REJECTION OF LEE'S VISIT WOULD DAMAGE TAIPEI-TOKYO TIES: FM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao said Monday
that relations between the Republic of China and Japan will be
damaged if the Japanese government rejects former ROC President
Lee-hui's application to visit that nation for medical purposes.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lee is now a private citizen, Tien said there is no
single article in current Japanese law that would justify a rejection
of Lee's entry for medical reasons.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, if the Japanese government fails to
screen Lee's visa application on humanitarian grounds and insists on
denying his entry, Taipei-Tokyo relations will definitely be
damaged," Tien explained.</P>
      <P>The minister made the remarks after Lee said at a press
conference Sunday that he has to go to Japan to receive treatment for
his heart problems. The outspoken former ROC president also
criticized the Japanese government for tip-toeing around the issue,
calling Tokyo "more timid than a mouse." Lee stressed that his Japan
travel plan has no political meaning.</P>
      <P>In response to a press query about his views on Lee's visa
application, Tien said he is hopeful that Japan will handle the issue
properly and refrain from bowing to mainland Chinese pressure to
block Lee's visit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Michihiko Komatsu, a department chief with the Taipei
Office of the Japanese Interchange Association (JIA), said the
Japanese government is carefully studying the issue and will make a
final decision in the near future.</P>
      <P>The JIA is a quasi-official organization that handles Japanese
relations with the ROC in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Komatsu said major factors to be mulled by the Japanese
government in deciding whether to approve Lee's visa application will
include humanitarian considerations, Japanese public opinion and the
views of foreign countries.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Lee's statement at his Sunday news conference that
he had filed his visa application with the JIA Taipei office on April
10, Komatsu said from procedural viewpoints, Lee's application was
not "formal." He declined to elaborate on the matter.</P>
      <P>In his first formal press conference since stepping down from the
presidency last May, Lee said that if the Japanese government claimed
that he didn't apply for a visa, "it amounts to lying."</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, Japan hinted Monday
that it might accept Lee's visa application, a move that could strain
its diplomatic ties with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"If the purpose of Lee's visit is for medical reasons, we could
consider it from a humanitarian standpoint," top Japanese government
spokesman Yasuo Fukuda told a news conference in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The issue has split Japan's Cabinet, with some members anxious
not to ruffle feathers in Beijing at a time when regional tensions
are on the rise.</P>
      <P>Fukuda reiterated Japan's official stance that it had not yet
received a visa application from Lee and that the government would
soon make a final decision on the matter.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Textile Institute and six central
American republics signed an agreement on cooperation Monday in a
ceremony marred by a brief protest incident.</P>
      <P>El Salvador Ambassador Francisco Ricardo Santana signed the
mutual assistance agreement on behalf of six central American
nations, also including Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and
Honduras. Yao Hsin-chuan, president of China Textile Institute also
signed the pact.</P>
      <P>But the signing ceremony was interrupted when two people, who had
gained entry by posing as interested spectators, held up protest
signs and began shouting slogans to criticize Taiwan firm Nien Hsing
Textile Co. The protest was triggered by a labor-management dispute
in a Nien Hsing plant in Nicaragua late last year.</P>
      <P>The protest lasted only half a minute before the two were asked
to leave. Nien Hsing Chairman Chen Jung-chiu, a guest at the
ceremony, declined to comment on the incident, which left him with a
somber expression.</P>
      <P>China Textile Institute said that the agreement is aimed at
promoting friendly relations between the ROC and its allies, adding
that the protest was "regretful." The institute also extended an
apology to the distinguished guests.</P>
      <P>As Central America has become an important foothold for Taiwan
textile companies to make inroads overseas, the signing of the
agreement will assist the nations' textile technology
development and help Taiwan businesses take root there.</P>
      <P>China Textile Institute officials are scheduled to visit Central
America in May to collect market information and plan for the
establishment of textile design, information and employee training
centers in Central America.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP PITCHES FOR ASIA-PACIFIC ALLIANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu urged Asia-Pacific countries Monday to form an alliance to
facilitate manpower, capital and cultural exchanges, as well as to
promote human rights and regional peace.</P>
      <P>Lu made the appeal in a speech delivered at the opening of the
"Asia-Pacific Forum: Women and Power," organized by the Institute for
National Development, a local private think tank.</P>
      <P>Addressing female parliamentarians and scholars from nine
Asia-Pacific countries, Lu said the ROC's existence is "critical to
Southeast Asia."</P>
      <P>In her view, Lu said, if Taiwan were to be swallowed by mainland
China, communism would probably spread to other Southeast Asian
countries. "And the 300-plus M-class missiles installed along the
southeastern mainland coast and targeting Taiwan might also be
deployed against other Southeast Asian nations," she suggested.</P>
      <P>The outspoken vice president went on to say that although Taiwan
has faced Beijing's military threat for the past half century, it has
not been daunted because it has five "soft-touch" strengths -- human
rights, democracy, peace, love and high technology.</P>
      <P>Lu said the international community should recognize the ROC's
achievements in political democratization and economic development
despite Beijing's constant military threat.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the people of Taiwan should not have to fear the
mainland threat, Lu said the people of Taiwan have "used their
willpower" to resist Beijing's missile threat.</P>
      <P>She appealed for closer cooperation among Taiwan, South Korea,
Japan and the Philippines to promote regional stability, prosperity
and peace. She also urged Canada, the United States, New Zealand and
Australia to strengthen cooperation with Asian countries for the
mutual benefit of all concerned.</P>
      <P>To reach this goal, Lu said major cities in Asia-Pacific
countries could first form an alliance to boost civic exchanges and
lay a foundation for official cooperation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu said she will push for the formation of an alliance
of women politicians around the world.</P>
      <P>In related news, she also said Monday at a seminar on religion,
world peace and spiritual enlightenment that "precautionary measures
are needed to ensure regional and world peace."</P>
      <P>Lu urged Beijing to remove all the missiles from the southeastern
mainland coastal areas and spend more of its financial resources on
improving welfare service projects for its 1.3 billion people than on
military expansion programs.</P>
      <P>For the well-being and security of the 23 million Taiwan people,
Lu said she will seek the assistance of United Nations-affiliated
non-government organizations to hold a world peace promotion program
in Taipei on Aug. 14 this year.</P>
      <P>She said anybody who wants permanent world peace must take
concrete action to boost this lofty goal.</P>

      <P>A young Korean-American who is regarded as
a model for U.S. teenagers visited the Republic of China Legislative
Yuan Monday.</P>
      <P>Danny Seo also presented copies of his book, titled "Heaven On
Earth: 15-Minute Miracles to Change the World," to several

      <P>The 23-year-old established Earth 2000 -- a youth organization --
with his friends using a startup of only US$10 when he was just 12 to
promote environmental protection. The organization now boasts 20,000
young members.</P>
      <P>Seo said that although many people are concerned about society,
they usually feel they have little time to help others. But as he
says in his book, good deeds actually need not take much time and
only 15 minutes a day can create miracles.</P>
      <P>He said that he did not expect such enthusiastic response to his
book and that he was elated to learn that after turning their thoughts
into action, many readers not only now help others, but also feel
good about themselves.</P>
      <P>Seo, who was invited to Taiwan by a publishing house and a local

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu has urged powerful people to resolve the bitterness of the people
in a deeply religious way.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remark Monday when she delivered a keynote speech at
a symposium on regional and world peace as well as environmentalism
sponsored by the Buddhist Dharma Drum Mountain Foundation.</P>
      <P>In line with the Taiwan visit of Bawa Jain, secretary general of
the U.N. Millennium World Religious and Spiritual Leaders Summit
Meeting, the foundation sponsored the symposium in response to calls
made at the recent U.N. summit in New York.</P>
      <P>Master Sheng Yen, founder of the foundation, extended his warm
welcome to the Chinese and foreign participants.</P>
      <P>In addition to the vice president, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung,
President of the Legislative Yuan Wang Jin-pyng, and Interior
Minister Chang Po-ya were also invited to attend the gathering.
Leaders from local enterprises, academia, and Buddhist, Catholic,
Christian and Taoist organizations also attended.</P>
      <P>Discussions were centered on how to safeguard world peace and
nature as well as how to eliminate religious discrimination and
racial confrontation. The attendees also issued a joint declaration
on world peace.</P>
      <P>Lu said that after 50 years of concerted efforts between the
government and the people of the Republic of China, Taiwan had
brought about a kind of religious miracle by promoting religious
freedom and peaceful coexistence among the island's various
religions.</P>
      <P>Lu further pointed out that recent natural disasters and man-made
calamities here have taught humility to formerly arrogant people, and
mercy to the formerly brutal.</P>
      <P>Lu also called for Beijing to take down all the missiles it has
deployed along the coast opposite Taiwan so as to reduce the chance
of war. She also called on the United Nations to pay attention to
Beijing's behavior.</P>
      <P>Jawa Jain said religious and spiritual organizations will
continue to play a very important role in future human development.
He also expressed the hope that the recent U.N. religious summit in

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Master Cheng Yen urged the people of
Taiwan to build a society based on "good deeds" with compassionate
hearts and concerted efforts Monday, the eve of the 35th anniversary
of the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation.</P>
      <P>The charity organization founder said that the Tzu Chi world is
built upon benevolent actions and seeks to build a harmonious society
in which everyone has love at the forefront of his or her mind.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is a small island, she encouraged people from all
walks of life in the country to bear in mind that "good deeds are the
treasure of our society" and to do their best to transform Taiwan
into a highly loving place.</P>
      <P>The foundation based in the eastern city of Hualien will launch a
series of activities to mark its 35th anniversary, including mountain
climbing, sermons, the delivery of assistance and an exhibition
featuring the four main themes of Tzu Chi activity -- mercy,
medicine, education and culture -- to introduce its services to the
public. Manuscripts prepared by Master Chen Yen in her early
religious life will also be on display.</P>
      <P>Master Cheng Yen said the foundation's results in the four areas
are only the basis for it to continue its mission in the pursuit of a
peaceful, beautiful and benevolent world.</P>
      <P>In the 35 years since its founding, Tzu Chi has offered
assistance to a total of 60,952 households and has set up more than
130 liaison offices in over 30 countries.</P>
      <P>In addition to four hospitals and a university, a technical
college, high school and elementary school, it set up a pioneering
bone marrow bank in 1993, persuading 211,177 people to volunteer bone
marrow samples for the databank and to donate bone marrow when a
match is found. Some 263 patients, 112 at home and 151 from abroad,
have received successful bone marrow transplants with Tzu Chi's help.</P>
      <P>The charity group has also taken charge of the reconstruction of
50 schools damaged in the 1999 Sept. 21 earthquake, with 22 of the
schools near completion, 17 of which are slated to be completed by

      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu called Monday for greater women's rights and proposed the
formation of a non-governmental "Alliance for Asian Women
Politicians."</P>
      <P>Lu made the proposal at an Asian forum sponsored by a local
foundation at the Taipei International Convention Center during a
speech on "Women and Power." Scores of representatives from nine
countries took part in the event.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the pursuit of greater rights in a wide range of
areas for women is aimed at reducing the possibility of war and
"mistakes," rather than challenging men, Lu told the audience that
the goal must be achieved step by step, saying "Rome was not built in
a day" and that the international community should pay greater heed
to the issue.</P>
      <P>Lu also revealed that she will launch a campaign on Aug. 14, the
final day of World War Two, to promote world peace in a bid to remind
the people not to make the same mistakes of the past.</P>
      <P>Pierrette Venne, a parliamentary member from Canada, said that
although women's rights have been improved over the past decades, the
female population still has to struggle for social, economic and
political rights comparable to the same rights enjoyed by their male
counterparts.</P>
      <P>Monique Guay, also from Canada, said women should play and active
role in politics. She urged her female peers not to be stymied by
their families or children in their pursuit of a political career.</P>
      <P>Marie Hasler, a parliamentary member from New Zealand, pointed
out that women are still unfairly treated in the workplace and in
politics, although their performances have been proved to be equal to
those of men.</P>
      <P>Setting herself as an example, Hasler that said that it is harder
for a woman than a man to become a public opinion leader and that
social and economic rights enjoyed by women are fewer.</P>
      <P>U.S. Congressman Roscoe Bartlett admitted that women "fit in"
better than men in certain fields and contended that women should not
be discriminated against in social, economic and political
activities. He expressed the opinion that women should be given the
same opportunities in society and that their performances should be
fairly recognized.</P>
      <P>South Korean parliamentarian Kim Jung Sook highly praised Lu for
her political achievements, saying that the ROC vice president has
set up a model of success for all women in the political domain.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo
Fukuda said Monday that the Japanese government would consider
"humanitarian principles" regarding a visa for former Republic of
China President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>The spokesman for the Japanese government made the remark while
commenting on a statement by Lee at a Taipei press conference the
previous day that his Japan visit would be purely for medical reasons
and would carry no political intent.</P>
      <P>Fukuda told the media that the Japanese government would consider
public opinions, humanitarian principles and "other factors" when
deciding whether to issue a visa for Lee.</P>
      <P>He added that the government would listen to the views of the
Foreign Ministry and make a decision in line with Japanese government
policy.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Yutaka Kawashima
said that his ministry would base its decision on whether to grant
Lee a visa on "humanitarian and political considerations."</P>
      <P>He admitted that it would not be easy to resolve the conflict
between "humanitarian consideration" and respect for the
"Japan-(mainland) China Joint Statement" signed when Tokyo and
Beijing normalized their diplomatic relations in September 1972.</P>
      <P>Some Japanese newspapers suggested that Fukuda's remarks showed
a softening of the Japanese government's position on issuing a visa
to Lee, while Kawashima's comment indicated a cautious attitude on
the part of the Foreign Ministry.</P>
      <P>Lee said Sunday that he presented his visa application through a
friend April 10 and expressed the hope that he would be able to
undergo post-heart operation treatment at a Japanese hospital around
April 24.</P>
      <P>The case has developed into a delicate triangular problem between
Japan, mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A mainland Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman reiterated Monday
that Beijing opposes Lee's Japan visit for whatever reason and wants
Japan to stop him from entering the country.</P>
      <P>She described Lee as the creator of "two Chinas," claimed that he
is not an ordinary citizen and said that his Japan visit is not a
"humanitarian issue," but a "political issue."</P>

      <P>Education Minister Ovid Tzeng promised
Monday to defend the interests of students, but called on them to
respect intellectual property rights and abstain from downloading
music files from the Internet without authorization.</P>
      <P>The minister said in a letter posted on the ministry's website
that he supports the students' advocacy that law enforcement
officials and police should be "very careful" about raiding campuses
and should refrain from any "unnecessary act."</P>
      <P>In an attempt to calm the students, who were infuriated by a
prosecutor's search of the student dormitories of National Cheng Kung
University, Tseng said he will retain lawyers for students who have
trouble with the law in the case.</P>
      <P>Noting that the rapid development of technology often exposes the
shortfalls of existing laws, Tseng said the protection of
intellectual property rights is an issue facing not only Taiwan but
the whole world.</P>
      <P>He urged the students to enjoy the benefits of rapid
communication and information-sharing made possible by modern
technology but to fully respect intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Rather than challenging intellectual property rights, Tseng said,
the students of Cheng Kung University should join forces with his
ministry and calmly face the legal issues arising from the incident.</P>
      <P>Tseng also called on the prosecutors and police to carefully
exercise their powers of search and refrain from any excessive acts.
He assured the students that his ministry will defend their interests
even more vigorously hereafter.</P>
      <P>The minister later met with the president and a student
representative of Cheng Kung University.</P>
      <P>Student representative Chiang Hsing-ti quoted Tseng as promising
that there will be no more searches of schools by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>However, the minister urged the Cheng Kung University students to
follow the law, said Chiang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an executive from the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry (IFPI) Taiwan office said Monday that his group
will await the outcome of the prosecutor's investigation before
determining whether to press charges in the case.</P>
      <P>Lee Jui-ping, secretary of the IFPI Taiwan office, said it is
still too early to say whether the IFPI will institute any litigation
before the prosecutors determine that the rights of any IFPI members
have been violated by the students.</P>
      <P>The incident was triggered by an April 11 judicial search of
dormitories of the university. Prosecutors, acting on a tip-off,
seized 14 personal computers on which MP3 music files were stored.</P>
      <P>Angered by what they called trespassing on campus, the students
staged a sit-in the next day and appealed to students of other
schools to protest in solidarity to counter the law enforcement
officials' crackdown on the downloading of music files from the
Internet, which is widespread among university students.</P>
      <P>They also condemned the search as trampling on the "freedom of
academia" and questioned its legality.</P>
      <P>The IFPI Taiwan office immediately backed the prosecutors and
vowed on April 13 to pursue anyone downloading music files from the
Internet without authorization.</P>
      <P>In a four-point statement, the IFPI said it will settle for
nothing less than a conviction against the offenders.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan admitted Monday that
the search of the university "departed somewhat from the guidelines
for such moves," although he said the search was legal.</P>
      <P>Judging from press reports, Chen said the prosecutor from the
Tainan Prosecutor's Office did not exceed his authority but appeared
to fail to report to his superiors in advance as required by the
guidelines.</P>
      <P>Chen declined to comment on the investigation, but he emphasized
that prosecutors should direct their energy to more serious crimes,
given the scarce resources the Justice Ministry has to fight crime.</P>
      <P>He echoed the opinions of Tseng, saying that prosecutors should
be very careful in exercising their search powers.</P>
      <P>Chen said that his office has asked the Tainan Prosecutor's
Office to explain whether its search was conducted according to the
guidelines on judicial searches.</P>
      <P>The guidelines, laid down in November with the purpose of
avoiding abuse of power, obliges prosecutors to seek their
supervisors' approval before carrying out a search.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LEADERS URGE JAPAN TO ISSUE VISA TO FORMER PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung and other Republic of China leaders urged the Japanese
government Monday to issue an entry visa for former President Lee
Teng-hui to undergo medical treatment in Japan.</P>
      <P>Asked by the media to comment on the issue after attending a
symposium, Lu said that Lee is an ordinary citizen and added that it
would be "shameful" for all Japanese if Tokyo refuses to issue Lee a
visa because of pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was asked to voice his view when he visited an
industrial zone in Changhua in central Taiwan, pointed out that Lee's
Japan visit is for medical reasons and has no political intent.</P>
      <P>He expressed his hope that Japan will allow Lee to visit Japan
based on the "humanitarian spirit" and added that he has asked the
Foreign Ministry to continue negotiating with the Japanese side over
the issue.</P>
      <P>Examination Yuan President Hsu Shui-teh, a former ROC
representative to Japan, called on the Japanese government to issue a
visa for Lee, noting that Lee has already stepped down from the
presidency and the Kuomintang chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that Lee is now an ordinary citizen and that Japan
should allow him to seek medical treatment in Japan if he so wishes.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao said Monday that the issue was
still being negotiated, but warned that if Japan rejects Lee's visit,
it might adversely affect relations between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung,
former director of the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, said that
a patient has the right to choose the best medical treatment he can
find and that Lee's wish for treatment in Japan must be respected.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several legislators visited the Taipei office of the
quasi-official Japan Interchange Association Monday morning to
present an open letter to the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>The letter urged Japan to follow the examples of British and
Czech authorities and issue an entry visa for Lee.</P>
      <P>Some legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
urged Taiwan tourists not to visit Japan if Lee is denied a visa.</P>
      <P>However, not everyone in Taiwan supports Lee's Japan visit. Some
physicians claimed that "Taiwan doctors are as good as Japanese
doctors" and added that there is no need for Lee to go to Japan
simply for post-heart surgery examination.</P>
      <P>More than 10 citizens visited the Taipei Office of the Japan
Interchange Association Monday and asked the Japanese government not
to allow Lee to visit Japan, claiming that Lee was only "pretending
to be sick."</P>

      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung Monday affirmed the outstanding contributions at home and
abroad by Taiwan's religious groups.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while speaking before a symposium titled
"Religions, World Peace and Mind Purification" organized by the
Buddhist Dharma Drum Mountain.</P>
      <P>Chang said that almost all religions in Taiwan are able to
accommodate each other and co-exist peacefully, especially since the
lifting of martial law in 1987.</P>
      <P>He noted that all religious groups on the island have made
outstanding charitable and relief contributions, not only in Taiwan,
but also in foreign countries.</P>
      <P>The premier cited the rescue and relief operations after the
devastating Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake at home and the recent relief
missions for quake victims in El Salvador and India.</P>
      <P>Chang also lauded Taiwan's religious organizations for
establishing hospitals, universities and publishing firms to engage
in medical, educational and cultural work.</P>
      <P>He asserted that "peace among religions is the foundation stone

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT URGES U.S. TO PROVIDE TAIWAN WITH DEFENSIVE ARMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 16 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
called Monday on the U.S. authorities to provide Taiwan with the
defensive weapons it needs to ensure its security and democracy.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while David Wu, a Chinese-American member
of the House of Representatives, at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The ROC head of state lauded Wu as "a son of Taiwan, the glory of
Taiwan and a friend of Taiwan" and said that democracy is Taiwan's
strongest protection.</P>
      <P>"The democratic outcome of Taiwan will be certainly ensured if
the United States provides Taiwan with necessary defense weapons in
accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) or if the U.S.
Congress passes the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA) currently
being debated," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed his heartfelt thanks to Wu for his firm
support for the cause of the ROC and his assistance in calling for
the easing of limitations on visits to the United States by Taiwan's
leaders and for providing Taiwan with necessary defense weapons. "You
are worthy of being described as a real friend of Taiwan," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he was moved when Wu and Lin Chao-liang, a Chinese
American violinist, visited their home town of Hsinchu last week and
said he hopes it will connect Taiwan's "silicon village" -- Hsinchu
-- with "silicon forest" -- Oregon -- so as to build Taiwan into a
"green silicon valley" in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>In return, Wu praised Taiwan's democratic achievements highly. He
said that history is written by brave individuals and that Chen and
Vice President Annette Lu are included among those history-making
individuals. "Liberty, democracy and human rights are not bestowed by
heaven but must be strived for through hard labor," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's implementation of the first peaceful power transition is
a common glory for the whole of Asia and history will record these
events, Wu continued.</P>
      <P>Chen replied that it was also a glory for Taiwan for a
Taiwan-born person to became a member of the U.S. House of
Representatives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INNER QUARRELS HINDER TAIWAN DIPLOMACY AS MUCH AS BEIJING: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>conflicting opinions within Taiwan about
the country's identity hinders the island's diplomacy no less than
Beijing's attempts to isolate it diplomatically, a Foreign Ministry
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, director of the Research and Planning Board
under the Foreign Ministry, told a symposium in Taipei that the lack
of consensus among the people of Taiwan has added difficulties to the
island's efforts to break through Beijing's containment.</P>
      <P>Citing the island's bid for U.N. membership as an example, Lo
said some call it "entry into the United Nations", implying that the
island is a new member rather than a former member, while others
insist it is a "return to the United Nations."</P>
      <P>The conflicting advocacy only confuses the country's few allies
in the United Nations and renders the country's diplomats at a loss
as to the politically correct way to profess their claims, said Lo.</P>
      <P>He branded Beijing's all-out efforts to exclude the island from
any international occasion as a hysteria which is so serious that
mainland Chinese diplomats have even tried to shut Taiwan
representatives out of international trade fairs and non-governmental
gatherings.</P>
      <P>Lo also criticized some pro-Beijing Taiwanese for "debasing
themselves" by hosting Beijing visitors while turning a blind eye to
Beijing's pressure on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He warned his countrymen against the thinking that by accepting
Beijing's "one China principle," all disputes between the two sides
would be solved, saying that it would only downgrade the island into
"another Hong Kong."</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SUPPORT FOR ROC WTO ENTRY STANCE UNCHANGED: U.S. OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior U.S. diplomat said here Monday
that the United States' stance toward Taiwan's entry to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>The United states has made all-out efforts to help Taiwan enter
the WTO, said Raymond Bughardt, director of the Taipei Office of the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), a semi-official organization set
up to handle U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic
relations.</P>
      <P>Bughardt made the remarks in a keynote speech delivered at the
25th Congress of the ROC-USA Economic Council, which opened at the
Headquarters of Chinatrust Commercial Bank chaired by Wang Chung-yu,
board chairman of the council.</P>
      <P>Bughardt pointed out that one should judge Taiwan's economic
globalization from the viewpoint of the Taiwan market being
globalized and Taiwan's market competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Mentioning that the United States would benefit from Taiwan's
economic globalization program, Bughardt said he believes Taiwan's
continued strong economic growth will help it become a good market
and a good trade partner for U.S. companies.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that the United States will strengthen its
cooperation with Taiwan in the fields of finance, energy, medicine
and telecommunications. However, he also said that Taiwan should
further relax its trade barriers on the service industry and U.S.
commodities.</P>
      <P>Bughardt also said that Taiwan should pay more attention to
intellectual property rights protection so as to help it be deleted
from the "special 301" watch list.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan could enter into cooperation with U.S.
biotech, telecommunications, energy and medicine fields.</P>
      <P>He added that maintaining a common economic prosperity between
Taiwan and the United States is a pillow of the Taiwan-U.S.
relationship, adding that the United States treasured Taiwan very
much because it is an important trade partner of the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPOWER DENIES RECEIVING GE COMPENSATION CLAIM OVER N-PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) denied
Tuesday that General Electric Co. (GE) of the United States has
demanded a US$50 million damage award for a 110-day suspension of
construction on the island's fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Huang Shou-ching, director of Taipower's nuclear and thermal
power generation engineering department, made the denial in response
to a newspaper report that GE has asked Taiwan's state-owned power
company to compensate it US$50 million for its financial loss due to
Taiwan's abrupt decision to halt construction on the new nuclear
power plant.</P>
      <P>Huang debunked the report, saying that GE has not yet produced
data concerning its financial loss caused by the power plant
construction hiatus nor has it presented a compensation claim.</P>
      <P>Huang said he has no idea about the possible source of the
newspaper report. "It's a surprise to me," he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the earlier GE submits its financial loss
report, the greater the benefit for it.</P>
      <P>"After we receive GE's compensation claim, we'll conduct a
comprehensive assessment with the assistance of relevant consulting
firms and accounting experts as well as send staff members to GE for
discussion," Huang explained, adding that if the two sides are far
divided over the compensation amount, Taipower will not rule out the
possibility of seeking commercial arbitration.</P>
      <P>GE is Taipower's largest contractor for its fourth nuclear
power plant, and its foreign contractors for the project also
includes Japan's Mitsubishi Co. and Hitachi Co.</P>
      <P>Bowing to pressure from the opposition-controlled Legislative
Yuan, the Republic of China government announced its decision to
resume construction on the controversial plant on Feb. 14.</P>
      <P>"And Taipower informed the three foreign contractors of the
decision the following day," Huang said, adding that Taipower also
asked the three firms to present their financial loss reports for
its reference.</P>
      <P>However, Huang said, none of them have so far furnished Taipower
with relevant data or made any compensation claims.</P>
      <P>Huang said GE once told Taipower that its financial loss
estimates require data from its 100-plus subcontractors. "I think
that the GE's delay in producing a financial loss report
may be related to the large number of its subcontractors,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led ROC government
abruptly announced a halt to construction on the partially built
nuclear power plant last October, sparking a fierce political fray
with the opposition-dominated legislature. Although the DPP has
never wavered in its anti-nuclear stance, the Cabinet gave in
to opposition pressure and agreed to resume construction on the
plant on Feb. 14.</P>
      <P>According to Taipower's own estimate, Huang said, the 110-day
hiatus incurred a financial loss of about NT$3.48 billion (US$106.1
million), including compensation claims from its foreign contractors
as well as Taipower's own loss.</P>
      <P>In Taipower's assessment, Huang said, GE-related loss is
estimated at NT$1.3 billion.</P>

National Chiao Tung University for a month-long course on
intellectual property rights and computer crime laws this May.</P>
      <P>The training program for the prosecutors is expected to improve
the professionalism of law enforcement regarding technology and
computer crimes that violate intellectual property rights, according
to a MOJ press release.</P>
      <P>Noting that unlawful Internet usage and computer crimes have
become rampant, with new tricks coming out everyday, the ministry has
formed a special team to discuss the feasibility of amending computer
crime regulations.</P>
      <P>The MOJ is also cooperating with National Chiao Tung University
for a three-year training and study program on computer related
crimes.</P>
      <P>According to the cooperation agreement, the university's graduate
school of technology law will appoint professors specializing in
intellectual property rights related to computers and technology to
teach the prosecutors chosen by the MOJ. The graduate school will
also assist in investigations when needed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the agreement states that the MOJ will provide Chiao
Tung University with textbooks on newly-developed technology crimes
and help prosecutors promote relevant intellectual property rights
litigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC PRESIDENT TO PAY PRIVATE VISIT TO CORNELL UNIVERSITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President of the Republic of
China Lee Teng-hui will pay a private visit to his alma mater Cornell
University in early May, Linda Grace-Kobas, a spokesperson for the
university said Monday.</P>
      <P>Grace-Kobas told the Central News Agency that Lee will visit his
granddaughter Lee Kun-yi who is currently studying at Cornell and
will also announce the establishment of a professorship in his name
during the visit.</P>
      <P>She said that reports that Lee will preside over a groundbreaking
ceremony for a graduate school in his name at Cornell are untrue,
adding that there is presently no graduate school nor building on
campus that is named after him.</P>
      <P>She said that Lee will announce a new donation during the visit,
mainly to set up a professorship in scientific research. Cornell
would not reveal the size of the donation.</P>
      <P>Lee's friends and several Cornell alumni donated US$2.5 million
to the university in 1994 to establish a Lee Teng-hui Professorship
in World Affairs, which has focused on global economy research.</P>
      <P>Reports about Lee planning to visit Cornell in 2001 surfaced last
December, but the school did not begin to arrange for such a visit
until about a month ago.</P>
      <P>Grace-Kobas said that Cornell is encouraged by Lee's planned
visit, but added that the university could not announce it
officially. It is understood that Lee has yet to apply for a visa and
that Cornell officials will have to check with Lee's staff for
details.</P>
      <P>Lee is scheduled to visit the university for two or three days,
for about the same length of time as his first return visit in 1995.
That visit infuriated the mainland Chinese leadership.</P>
      <P>Cornell students will be taking their final term exams during
Lee's visit. As mainland Chinese students mobilized a petition
campaign last month to protest against Lee's expected visit, it is
expected that they may stage a protest during the former ROC
president's visit.</P>
      <P>Grace-Kobas said that the stance of the school is that as long as
it is done in a peaceful manner and does not affect the movement of
others, students can express their views freely.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force's Mirage
2000-5 jet fighter wing will be formally commissioned into service
May 10, marking yet another step forward in the ROC's military
modernization, military spokesman Huang Suey-sheng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang told a routine press conference that with the commissioning
of the Mirage wing, the ROC Air Force's combat capability will enter
a new stage.</P>
      <P>"It will also help boost our military's morale and the general
public's confidence in our overall defense capabilities," he noted.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Hsiao Yung-hua, deputy head of the
Air Force General Headquarters' operations department, noted that the
Air Force took delivery of the first of 60 Mirage 2000-5s purchased
from France in May 1997, and that its officers and men have been
thoroughly trained on the jets.</P>
      <P>The ROC's first Mirage squadron was formed in December 1997 and a
second squadron was founded in November 1998 when the delivery of the
entire order of 60 Mirage fighters was completed, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>"After finalizing our intensive replacement training programs,
the new Mirage wing will begin to flex its muscles and assume air
defense missions from May 10," Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>He also announced that a grand ceremony marking the commissioning
of the Mirage wing will be held at the Air Force base in the northern
Taiwan county of Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>The ceremony will consist of a flyover by the new jets as well as
a ground display of the Mirage fighters, Hsiao said. A total of 24
Mirages will fly past the review stand in formation and another 18
aircraft will be reviewed on the ground, together with pilots and
relevant technical personnel, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsiao further said that the Air Force is scheduled to hold
previews of the Mirage flyover on April 18, April 26, May 3 and May
8, respectively.</P>
      <P>"For the previews, partial airspace controls will be imposed
between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on the above-mentioned days. As the
controlled areas do not fall on flight routes, the ban will not
affect domestic and international flights," he explained.</P>
      <P>The Mirage fighters, along with the ROC's 130 locally built
indigenous defense fighters (IDFs) and 150 U.S.-made F-16 jet
fighters, form the backbone of the nation's second generation
warplane fleet.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan representative of the Dalai
Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, reached an agreement
with a Taipei City Government cultural official to increase cultural
exchanges Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tenzin Phuntsok Atisha, accompanied by his secretary Kunga Tashi,
called on Lung Ying-tai, director of the Taipei Cultural Affairs
Bureau, on Tuesday morning. In accordance with Tibetan customs,
Atisha presented her with a traditional Hada, and a Tibetan Buddha
statue.</P>
      <P>Lung told Atisha about her experience with the Dalai Lama during
her four meetings with the Tibetan leader. She also expressed the
hope that during the Dalai Lama's next visit to Taiwan, he will
attend a seminar arranged by the bureau to meet with local art and
literary figures for a cultural dialogue to increase mutual
understanding.</P>
      <P>Atisha responded by noting that a Tibetan performance group
recently come to Taiwan to take part in the Miaoli International
Mask Festival in northern Taiwan. He added that he hopes more
Tibetan art and literary figures as well as performance groups will
be invited to Taipei to promote the understanding of Tibet here.</P>
      <P>He also said that Tibetans in exile used to have a certain degree
of misunderstanding about Taiwan, but the situation has greatly
improved because of the recent bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>On two-way cultural exchanges, Lung said her
preliminary plan includes asking members of the Tibetan art world
to serve as exchange artists in Taipei. She said they would be able
to give speeches and create art as well as give Taipei residents a
chance to learn more about Tibetan arts and culture.</P>
      <P>She stressed that the bureau will provide pavilions to showcase
Tibetan culture during an Asian cultural festival scheduled to be
held in Taipei in July.
 The Dalai Lama concluded his second visit to Taiwan recently.
Just as he had done during his visit in 1997, the charismatic Tibetan
leader attracted a wide following during his more recent 10-day

    <HEADLINE>WAYS OF CROSS-STRAIT INTEGRATION OPEN FOR DISCUSSION: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday
that the methods for implementing integration between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait are open for discussion.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the idea of his predecessor Vincent Siew
about forming a common market between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait is one method of integration, and it should be open for
discussion.</P>
      <P>He noted that President Chen Shui-bian had earlier expressed the
hope that the two sides could start with cultural and economic
integration before moving toward political integration, but Chen had
not touched on the method of integration. This method is still open
for discussion, the premier added.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks during a question and answer session in
the legislature, in which Legislator Chen Chuan-tsan of the
opposition Kuomintang asked about his thoughts on Taiwan's situation
after Shanghai has overtaken Tokyo and New York as a world commercial
center in the future. The lawmaker noted that some officials advocate
the establishment of a common market across the Taiwan Strait after
both sides join the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the efficiency of the Beijing
administration is indeed very attractive to Taiwan businessmen and is
worthy of emulation, but also highlights the fact that the rule of
law governs Taiwan while the rule of man administers the mainland.
Beijing's system also entails risks for Taiwan businessmen investing
in the mainland, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the premier noted that there will be an estimated 10
mergers among local banks this year. He added that if the legislature
passes the financial holding company law during the first half of
this year, at least five applicants are expected to apply to set up
financial holding companies.</P>
      <P>He also promised that he would map out a tax reform proposal by
the end of the year, but stressed that it will not necessarily be
implemented by that time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. EXPERT TO HELP PROTECT ENDANGERED FORMOSAN BLACK BEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>David Garshelis, a world-renowned U.S.
bear expert, is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan next Monday to study
the Formosan black bear, an endangered species endemic to Taiwan,
the Taiwan branch of the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Garshelis, a University of Minnesota professor, will travel to
the Tafen wildlife research base on Jade Mountain in central Taiwan
to conduct a field study along with his student, Huang Hsiu-mei, who
is known to local aborigines as the "Mother of Formosan Black Bears"
for her dedication to tracking the life and plight of the species in
the island's mountain regions.</P>
      <P>Huang, who is now working on a doctoral dissertation under
Garshelis' guidance at the University of Minnesota, has helped
arrange for her mentor's upcoming visit to the island, said the JGI.</P>
      <P>The JGI said that although the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture and the domestic academic community have devoted a lot of
money and manpower to the study of the Formosan black bear, the
actual number of surviving animals is unknown.</P>
      <P>It was Huang who took the initiative to track the endangered
species' whereabouts on the island.</P>
      <P>"I have believed that the bear is the soul of the mountains ever
since I studied at National Taiwan Normal University's Department of
Biology and later at the Graduate Institute of Zoology at National
Taiwan University," Huang recalled.</P>
      <P>In July 1998, Huang said she returned to Taiwan after learning a
repertoire of bear-catching skills in the United States. "I have
since traveled between Taiwan and the United States to pursue the
study of Formosan bears."</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, Huang has often traveled deep into
Taiwan's mountain regions by herself to track the Formosan black
bears and study their activities.</P>
      <P>"During the period, I have managed to plant computer chips and
detectors on 15 Formosan bears to allow us to follow their lives by
satellite," Huang said.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Formosan black bears face the threat of
extinction. "Seven of the 15 bears I tagged have had their palms
amputated as ingredients for Chinese medicine and cuisine," she
lamented.</P>
      <P>Huang said recent media reports of the poaching of some endemic
wildlife, such as sambar deer, have worried her. "I therefore asked
Prof. Garshelis to come to Taiwan to use the satellite monitoring
system in order to check whether the 15 Formosan bears are still
alive and healthy."</P>
      <P>Huang recalled that when she began to track Formosan bears, many
aborigines had advised her to drop her plan and stay away from the
species for the sake of her personal safety.</P>
      <P>"But with love and concern, I have managed to ease the
long-existing tension between mankind and wild animals," Huang said
proudly, adding that she has developed intimate relationships with
baby bears and even bulky male bears.</P>
      <P>When Jane Goodall, a renowned British primatologist known as the
"Mother of Chimpanzees" visited Taiwan last year, she lauded Huang's
courage and dedication to the study of Taiwan's endangered bears.
Huang is now locally known as the "Jane Goodall of Taiwan," a
testament to her achievements in studying and protecting the
endangered Formosan black bears.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) is studying the feasibility of easing entry restrictions on
mainland Chinese professionals intending to visit Taiwan, an MAC
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Ching-sheng, an MAC economic researcher, made the remarks at
a public hearing at the Legislative Yuan on the promotion of
commercial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In response to appeals by legislators, travel agents and business
executives with investments in mainland China to ease restrictions on
visits by mainland professionals, Chou said the MAC is mulling the
issue along with the opening of Taiwan's doors to mainland business
executives and tourists.</P>
      <P>Chou said he disagrees with claims by some critics that the MAC,
which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, will back off from
its earlier promise to open the doors to mainland tourists in July.</P>
      <P>In fact, he went on, the MAC is studying the issue together with
the possible relaxation of entry terms for mainland technological and
other professionals.</P>
      <P>Noting that opening the country's doors to mainland tourists
involve many complicated issues, Chou said the government must make a
comprehensive evaluation and work out feasible measures to minimize
the new "open-door" policy's adverse impact on Taiwan's national
security.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, an average of 80,000 mainland people now stay
in Taiwan each day to visit ailing relatives or attend family
reunions.</P>
      <P>"The number will definitely surge once we open our doors to
mainland tourists," Chou said, adding that for the sake of
maintaining national security and social stability, the MAC must work
out many preventive measures to curb overstays or illegal working by
mainland visitors.</P>
      <P>Chou further said the MAC is assessing the pros and cons of
extending the maximum stay by mainland technological professionals to
three years, as well as allowing the entry of mainland businessmen in
preparation for Taiwan's entry to the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>He added that the evaluation of all those issues is scheduled to
be completed by the end of June.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen was quoted by the local
press as having told lawmakers Monday that the government indeed
intends to open Taiwan's doors to mainland tourists from July 1 as
originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsai reportedly admitted that the program is still
hampered by mainland China's refusal to resume dialogue with Taiwan's
semi-official intermediary body -- the Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>
      <P>Sources said the Cabinet may allow the MAC to hold talks with
mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office to discuss issues related to
Taiwan's opening of its doors to tourists from the mainland.</P>

      <P>Although Citibank, N.A. recently announced
large-scale layoffs, personnel at the Taipei Branch will not be

      <P>He said that the announced layoffs will only hit personnel
working in the bank's investment department.</P>
      <P>With Wall Street's tailspin this year and a slowing world
economy, banking institutions have been reporting reduced revenues in

on changes in the bank's credit card sales policy that will affect
their pay, the official explained why the bank had to adjust its
credit card sales strategy.</P>
      <P>Changing the strategy was necessary in order to readjust the
payroll structure and the bonus system, he said, adding that a great
majority of staff members agreed with the company's changes when they

Basic Law. The allowance, personnel welfare and vacation systems will

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian described as
"unimaginable" Tuesday the idea that one nation can dictate the

      <P>Meanwhile, sources from Tokyo reported that the Japanese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs was still pondering the visa issue.</P>
      <P>A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the ministry is still
carefully considering public opinion, humanitarian principles and
other factors in deciding whether to issue a visa for Lee.</P>
      <P>Declining to say when exactly the Japanese Foreign Ministry will
make a final decision, the spokesman noted that the decision will be
made "of Japan's own will."</P>
      <P>Also in Japan, a number of Cabinet ministers spoke up for Lee,
urging the Foreign Ministry to grant him a visa.</P>
      <P>Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said the Lee visa issue
should be handled carefully and with vigilance and he questioned the
justification of "intervention" by Taiwan's president and Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in Japan's decision over a visa for a "private
citizen."</P>
      <P>He added that further investigation is needed to find out whether
Lee's insistence on visiting Japan is for purely medical reasons.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, Foreign Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Katherine Chang
again called for the Japanese government to issue a visa for Lee
based on humanitarian considerations "as quickly as possible."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT INSPECTS CENTRAL TAIWAN QUAKE ZONES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Taiwan,  April  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said
Tuesday that post-earthquake reconstruction programs should give top
priority to the repair or rebuilding of traffic systems.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while making an inspection tour of
mountainous regions of central Taiwan that bore the brunt of a
devastating earthquake that rattled the island on Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is pleased to learn that repair of a section of the
Central Cross-Island Highway damaged in the 9-21 earthquake can be
completed by mid-July.</P>
      <P>"By then, traffic between Tungshih and the scenic Lishan area
will be able to run smoothly again," Chen said, adding that reopening
the road is critical to the recovery of the battered local tourist
industry.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Chen inspected a construction project aimed
at reinforcing the Tehchi Reservoir, which had its power-generating
functions affected after a nearby dam was damaged by the earthquake.</P>
      <P>Chen later visited the scenic Lishan area, where he was briefed
on a mudslide prevention project and a long-term program to reclaim
hillside land from private farmers whose land leases with the
government have long expired.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture Chairman Chen Hsi-huang told the president
that the council will reclaim 800-plus hectares of hillside land from
private operators by the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said overuse of land resources has caused
serious environmental problems in the region, including mudslides.
"We should try to seek a balance between protecting the environment
and improving farmers' livelihoods," he said.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by several central and local government officials,
Chen also visited Lishan Elementary School to show his concern about
the school's operation after its campus was partially damaged in the
earthquake. Chen was all smiles when he learned that all the damaged
classrooms have been repaired. He presented more than 300 children's
books to the school, many of which are biographies of noted religious
leaders, politicians and artists.</P>
      <P>During the inspection tour, Chen also confirmed that his only
daughter, 26-year-old Chen Hsing-yu, will marry in September.</P>
      <P>"I'm very glad to see my daughter find her life partner. I wish
them a happy marriage," Chen smiled.</P>
      <P>The future son-in-law of the first family is a 29-year-old doctor
from National Taiwan University Hospital, Chao Chien-ming. The
bride-to-be is a dentist at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT DENIES REPORTS ABOUT NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan categorically denied Tuesday that his party will launch a
no-confidence vote against Premier Chang Chun-hsiung in May.</P>
      <P>Stressing that scholars with KMT-affiliated think tanks have only
been studying the case of the so-called "minority government" led by
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) since last May, Lien
said that now is not the right time to advocate the move.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng said that the party has no
intention of starting a no-confidence motion and added that although
some party members might have voiced such intent, they are merely
personal views and by no means a consensus reached within the party.</P>
      <P>Lien and Lin made the remarks following a meeting with a KMT
subgroup in the Legislative Yuan which expressed its concern over the
issue, based on information provided by DPP Central Standing
Committee member C.P. Kao.</P>
      <P>A leading local newspaper also reported that a top-secret
document circulating within the KMT suggests the party launch a
no-confidence motion against the premier May 20, the first
anniversary of the DPP-led government and pass the vote in June in
order to shift the legislative election to August from December.</P>
      <P>Lin said he has no knowledge of any such document.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Wang Chih-kang also denied the report and accused
the ruling DPP of leaking the news to the media, a move which Wang
said would only further provoke public concern and affect social
stability.</P>
      <P>Echoing Lin's words, Wang said it is true that some scholars have
in the past broached the proposal to the KMT authorities, but only as
personal opinions. He pledged that the KMT will never start a
no-confidence motion to achieve its own interests, but he also
pointed out that neither will it sit idly by in the face of the
present political disorder and economic recession.</P>
      <P>Wang claimed that the KMT has commissioned a group of experts to
study the Republic of China Constitution in a bid to bail the nation
out of the disorder produced by the DPP's lack of respect of the
ROC's constitutional system.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the "no-confidence vote" suggestion was only one
of many proposals made by the experts, Wang charged the DPP for
intentionally misguiding the public in that direction.</P>
      <P>The KMT spokesman also denied speculation by Kao that a KMT
assessment task force has recommended him to take part in the Taipei
County magistrate election slated for December. He called the
speculation "groundless" and said he is happy with his current job.</P>
      <P>Shen Chih-hui, legislative whip of the opposition People First
Party (PFP), said the PFP is suspicious about the media report. She
added that her party will not agree with a no-confidence measure at a
time when Taiwan needs political stability to upgrade its
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Standing Committee also issued a statement later
the same day calling on all political parties to refrain from seeking
their own interests and to instead work together for a bright
national future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VEEP LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TO HELP TIBETAN CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu urged local private organizations Tuesday to support a
fund-raising campaign to help exiled Tibetan children in India.</P>
      <P>Lu made the appeal in a speech delivered at the opening of a
seminar on women volunteers and social services, sponsored by the
ROC National Women's League in celebration of its 51th founding
anniversary.</P>
      <P>Lu said she was moved by the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader
Dalai Lama's donation of US$150,000 to help the victims of a
devastating earthquake that rattled Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999. The
Dalai Lama made the donation during his recent visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that thousands of Tibetan people flee to India annually
from their Chinese communists-ruled homeland, Lu said many young
Tibetan exiles do not have opportunities to receive education.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, I plan to launch a campaign to pool resources in
the private sector to help build schools in the northern Indian city
of Dharamsala, also the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile, to
let Tibetan children receive formal education," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu said she hopes that Taiwan residents can show more
concern about the lives of those residing on Taiwan's offshore
islands, such as Penghu, Orchid Island and the defense outposts of
Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Lu said she found after her recent inspection tours of those
areas that there are both geographic and psychological "distances"
or gaps between Taiwan and its offshore islands.</P>
      <P>"Welfare services for elderly people in the offshore areas must
be modernized and children there should be offered access to
computer education," Lu said, adding that Taiwan residents should
help boost the development of the offshore islands.</P>
      <P>As the Taiwan economy has been mired in doldrums, Lu
further urged local people to make pleasure trips at home instead
of going abroad for sightseeing purposes. "By so doing, we can help
accelerate the recovery of our tourist industry and overall
economy," Lu said.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) plans
to raise the employment stabilization fee for domestic employers
hiring foreign workers to cope with the escalating unemployment rate,
CLA Chairman Chen Chu said Monday.</P>
      <P>The CLA, Taiwan's highest government organization in charge of
labor-policy making, plans to set aside NT$6.2 billion (US$193

areas.</P>
      <P>Lin Tsong-ming, director-general of the Employment and Vocational
Training Administration under the CLA, said that the fund currently
stands at NT$10.4 billion and added that if the unemployment
continues to increase in the next year, the amount will probably
shrink to NT$4.6 billion.</P>
      <P>The CLA plans to raise the employment stabilization fund by 20
percent in fiscal 2001, which would bring in a total of NT$5.42

      <P>The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
might consider issuing an entry visa to former Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui if he restricts his visit to the western
prefecture of Okayama, an ROC diplomatic source said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>After a week of "brainstorming" since Lee filed an application
with the Taipei office of the quasi-official Japan Interchange
Association April 10 for a visa to visit Japan, the Japanese Foreign
Ministry said Tuesday that the ministry will consider Lee's
application favorably if he agrees to confine his activities in Japan
only to receiving medical treatment in a hospital in Kurashiki City,
Okayama Prefecture, according to Lo Fu-chen, Taipei's top
representative in Japan.</P>
      <P>In his visa application, Lee stated that he wants to receive
treatment for a heart condition at the Kurashiki hospital before
April 24, with the treatment conducted by the same Japanese doctor
who supervised Lee's heart surgery at the National Taiwan University
Hospital last Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>Lo said that with the latest condition offered by the Japanese
Foreign Ministry, it is now up to Lee to decide whether he will honor
this condition so as to enable him to receive a Japanese visa.</P>
      <P>In two rounds of talks with Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori Tuesday,
Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said his ministry needs a better
understanding of Lee's "real" reason for wishing to visit Japan, as
he said he had heard that Lee also hopes to visit Kyoto University,
his alma mater.</P>
      <P>Mori, meanwhile, is supposed to have instructed during the talks
that the Foreign Ministry must issue a visa for Lee based on

of Taiwan's main political parties.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, the NFTU announced that it plans to organize a

      <P>Besides the NFTU, several other labor organizations, including
the Chinese Federation of Labor (CFL), will also stage parades on the

      <P>The CFL will call for a "ten-thousand-worker parade," to appeal
for the implementation of an 84-hour biweekly working hour system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONGRESSMAN SAYS HE WILL STICK TO HIS GUNS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Congressman David Wu, a Democrat from
Oregon, said Tuesday that although he alienated many business groups
by voting against permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status for
Beijing, keeping true to his campaign promises had regained him the
support of the voters in his re-election campaign.</P>
      <P>Currently in Taiwan to visit his birthplace, the first
Taiwan-born U.S. representative admitted to a CNA reporter Tuesday
that his opposition for granting PNTR to Beijing had offended many
Asian-Americans as well as business groups in Oregon, which is
developing its high-tech industry and is eager to explore foreign
markets such as mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said he preferred to deliver on his campaign promise
by voting against PNTR for Beijing in solidarity with labor unions.
His consistent political stance has earned him a reputation for
honesty, which, combined with his successful efforts in seeking
federal funding for research projects, medical centers and a light
rail in Oregon, turned the voter tide in his direction when he sought
re-election last year, he said.</P>
      <P>As to the midair collision between a U.S. spy plane and a
mainland Chinese jet fighter, Wu said he is glad the incident has
been partially resolved with the release of the 24 American airmen
involved.</P>
      <P>"Some damage has been done, but at least it has been limited
somewhat by the Beijing government's release of the individuals,"
said Wu.</P>
      <P>He said the United States has undertaken the obligation to sell
Taiwan all the appropriate defensive weapon necessary for Taiwan's
defense, adding his hope that the administration will follow the
relevant laws and consider exclusively the legitimate defense needs
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu attributed his political success to the openness of U.S.
society, touting America as a "very open country and culture ... a
society of opportunity ..."</P>
      <P>Oregon voters elected him to represent them in Washington, "not
because I was the best Chinese American candidate ... but because
they are open-minded and the possibility that I might be the best
candidate." Wu said.</P>
      <P>The congressman who switched from medical school to law school at
Harvard and went on into politics, offered valuable advice to parents
in Taiwan that they should encourage their children to go into fields
about which they are passionate.</P>
      <P>It might be tough for parents to do so, Wu said, but added that
young people are more likely to succeed in fields they feel great
passion about than in fields their parents think are more secure.</P>
      <P>He said he wants his children to learn Chinese while they are
young, because keeping some ties with one's past is a very human
need. The challenge, Wu said, is to keep a sense of roots in one's
past but remain open to all sorts of other cultures and potentially
different futures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAINAN MAYOR DETAINED OVER GRAFT CHARGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,   Taiwan,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tainan District Court
approved Wednesday a prosecution request to hold Tainan City Mayor
George Chang incommunicado over his alleged involvement in a
governmental land-requisition scam.</P>
      <P>The district court made the decision after hours of discussion
among several judges.</P>
      <P>Shen Yang-jen, the presiding judge of the court, said the
decision was made out of several considerations, including that the
land-requisition project violated the principles of "reasonability
and necessity," all detained defendants claimed that Chang played a
leading role in the scam and many relevant city government files
carried Chang's written directives concerning the case.</P>
      <P>Chang was accused of having ordered the requisition of certain
plots of land in the southern Taiwan city in order to benefit
Tainan City Council Speaker Huang Yu-wen, who has been detained over
the scam.</P>
      <P>Tainan prosecutors investigating the case said they believe that
Chang had conspired with Huang over the land requisitions and that
Chang is still hiding some related documents from prosecutors.
Therefore, the prosecutors requested that Chang be hold in
custody to prevent him from destroying evidence or collaborating with
other witnesses.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan said at a meeting of the
Legislative Yuan's Judicial Committee Wednesday that the Tainan
prosecutors informed the Ministry of Justice of their decision to
request for Chang's detention Tuesday. "Under current law, they do
not need my approval to make such a request to the district court,"
he explained.</P>
      <P>Chen told lawmakers that prosecutors have demanded Chang's
detention mainly because they think it will facilitate their access
to relevant city government files.</P>
      <P>In addition to Chang, eight other people, including the speaker
and deputy speaker of the Tainan City Council, have also been taken
into custody over the land-requisition scam.</P>
      <P>Chang, a scholar-turned-politician, was the fourth
incumbent local government chief from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party to be charged with corruption.</P>
      <P>After Chang's detention, the Ministry of the Interior said Lin
Ching-Tuei, chief secretary of the Tainan City Government, will serve
as acting mayor for the time being. Chang has not appointed a deputy
mayor after Tsai Wen-pin resigned from the deputy mayoral post over
different political concepts with Chang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMMUNIST CHINA'S CLAIM TO TAIWAN 'ABSURD': FORMER U.S. AMB. TO U.N.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communist China's claim to the island
of Taiwan is "just too absurd" and "outrageous," according to former
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Jean J. Kirkpatrick.</P>
      <P>"There is just no reason to stand by and permit the Chinese
Communists to take them (the people of Taiwan) over," the director of
Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at the American Enterprise
Institute stated during an interview Saturday on the "Judicial Watch
Report," a radio broadcast sponsored by Judicial Watch, a
Washington-based legal watch group.</P>
      <P>"I strongly believe that we committed a long time ago to selling
Taiwan the technology and weapons which are necessary for their (the
Taiwan people's) defense," Kirkpatrick said, adding that "we've been
doing it in quite an inadequate way," the World Wide Web newspaper
WorldNetDaily reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The Clinton administration dramatically increased the amount of
technology and weapons provided to the mainland," she added.</P>
      <P>As a result of the transfer of advanced weaponry, the U.S.
commitment to adequately supply arms to Taiwan means a lot more than
before Communist China "had all the missiles they have at the present
time," she noted.</P>
      <P>In response to speculation that U.S. President George W. Bush had
agreed to refrain from selling Aegis-class destroyers to Taiwan in
return for the release of the 24 American crew members recently held
by mainland China, Kirkpatrick said that "I don't believe the
president would, in that situation, offer some kind of guarantee that
we weren't going to sell the Aegis" to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. GOV'T URGED TO SELL AEGIS-EQUIPPED DESTROYERS TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  17 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Congressman Bob Stump, chairman
of the House Armed Forces Committee, is urging Vice President Dick
Cheney to support the sale of Aegis-equipped destroyers to Taiwan,
stressing that this would be a "clear, firm signal to China of the
United States' commitment to seeing the Taiwan question resolved
peacefully."</P>
      <P>In an April 12 letter to the vice president, the Arizona
Republican congratulated the Bush administration's astute handling of
the Washington-Beijing standoff following the April 1 collision
between a U.S. Navy surveillance aircraft and a Chinese jet fighter.</P>
      <P>Stump said he was particularly struck by the administration's
"consistent reference to the obligation the United States has, under
the Taiwan Relations Act, to maintain Taiwan's self-defense
capability," adding that "this obligation will not be compromised by
demands from China."</P>
      <P>In this regard, Rep. Stump wrote, "I respectfully recommend that
the legitimate need for Taiwan to acquire Arleigh Burke destroyers
outfitted with the Aegis battle management system be recognized."</P>
      <P>"Discretion is clearly the order of the day on any decisions
related to Taiwan. However, I firmly believe that if we do not
provide Taiwan with the system today, the day might come when we will
have to help Taiwan defend itself, just like we did in March 1996,"
noted the congressman.</P>
      <P>Stump pointed out that Taiwan's need for the Aegis system is
legitimate and that an indication from the (Bush) administration that
this is so would be a clear and firm signal to Beijing of the
U.S. commitment to seeing the Taiwan question resolved
peacefully.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the president of the Formosa Association for Public
Affairs, Chen Wen-yen, said that the new administration has rightly
focused on stability in East Asia as a key goal, and that it sees a
strong Taiwan as, in Secretary of State Colin Powell's words, "the
foundation of stability and security in that part of the world."</P>
      <P>"The Aegis sale will buttress stability in the region and thus
supports both the United States and Taiwan's interests," Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
will make a stopover in New York May 21-22 en route to a five-leg
visit to Latin America, government sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The layover will mark a breakthrough in substantive ROC-U.S.
relations, according to diplomatic observers who pointed out that in
the past, the United States only allowed the ROC president and vice
president to make transit stops in West Coast cities such as Los
Angeles and San Francisco.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office is scheduled to unveil Thursday the
itinerary of Chen's second overseas trip since taking office in the
ROC's first-ever democratic transfer of power between different
political parties last May.</P>
      <P>Sources close to the Presidential Office said Chen is scheduled
to leave Taipei May 21 for his five-country Central and South America
visit aimed at shoring up the ROC's relations with its diplomatic
allies in the region.</P>
      <P>The tour will take Chen to El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama,
Paraguay and Honduras, the sources said, adding that the president is
scheduled to end his visit June 3.</P>
      <P>On his way home, the sources went on, Chen will make a stopover
in Houston, Texas. Major Taiwanese groups in Texas are reportedly
planning a variety of activities to welcome Chen. According to the
sources, Chen will visit a museum and library dedicated to former
U.S. President George Bush and the U.S. National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) during his transit stay in Houston.</P>
      <P>One of the major events on Chen's Latin American itinerary will
be his attendance at a summit meeting between the top leaders of the
ROC and its Central American allies, scheduled to open in El Salvador
May 25.</P>
      <P>During the summit meeting, Chen will exchange views with his
Central American counterparts on the integration of Central American
countries and major regional development programs.</P>
      <P>Chen will also tour a new residential community built with the
assistance of Taiwan's largest charity -- the Buddhist Compassionate
Relief Tzu Chi Foundation -- after El Salvador was rattled by two
devastating earthquakes early this year.</P>
      <P>Chen's entourage will be composed of officials from the
Presidential Office, the National Security Council, and agricultural
and economics departments, as well as parliamentarians and business
leaders.</P>
      <P>Chen made his first overseas visit as ROC head of state last
August, on a trip which took him to the Dominican Republic, Costa
Rica and Nicaragua, as well as the African countries of The Gambia,
Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF LABOR DISPUTES SETS NEW HIGH IN 2000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 8,000 labor disputes in Taiwan in 2000
represents a new high and involved 57,000 workers, according to
statistics released recently by the Cabinet-level Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The two figures are 37 percent and 85.5 percent, respectively,
higher than the 1999 levels, according to the DGBAS statistics.
Meanwhile, nearly 5,000 factories were shut down for the whole of
2000, up 1,000 from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The tallies show that the number of jobless middle-aged and
elderly workers was also on the rise, with the unemployment rate in
these age groups growing from 7.8 percent in 1995 to 15.1 percent in
2000. In terms of educational backgrounds, the jobless rate of
workers with junior high school education accounted for 30 percent of
the total unemployed workers in 1995, a ratio that rose to 35 percent
in 2000.</P>
      <P>As a result of a plummeting demand for unskilled workers due to
increased automation, DGBAS officials said that the number of
unemployed grassroots laborers in the manufacturing sector increased
by 10,000 to reach around 118,000 in 1999 on a year-to-year basis.</P>
      <P>The officials predicted that the unemployment structure may
worsen in the coming years with Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization, fast-growing automation and an industry exodus.</P>
      <P>A deteriorating job market since the fourth quarter of last year
also had a negative impact on local employees, the officials added,
noting that the average monthly salary of domestic workers was
NT$42,000 (US$1,270) in 2000, a record low of 2.5 percent in terms of
annual increase.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF PART-TIME WORKERS GROWING: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of part-time workers on the
domestic job market has grown to account for 5.9 percent of Taiwan's
total workforce, according to the results of a recent survey by the
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>However, the ratio is still far lower than Japan's 24 percent or
the 13 percent recorded in Europe and the United States, according to
the poll, which discovered that only 12.4 percent of Taiwan
enterprises have hired part-time workers and that only a slightly
higher ratio of 12.6 percent of them are planning to do so in the
coming year.</P>
      <P>Attributing the leading reason behind the growth in part-time
workers to an economic slowdown, the CLA noted that the moonlighting
population has been steadily increasing and has spread from the labor
sector to a wider range of areas such as office clerks and computer
technicians.</P>
      <P>The CLA also pointed out that the service sector has a greater
interest in employing part-time workers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONLY ONE ALLEGEDLY DANGEROUS U.S. DRUG MARKETED IN TAIWAN: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Only one of the seven U.S.-approved but
allegedly dangerous pharmaceuticals has been marketed in Taiwan, the
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Of the seven unsafe prescription drugs mentioned in this year's
Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative report, we have only approved
the use of one of them in Taiwan," said Hu Yo-fu, director of the
DOH's Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs.</P>
      <P>"That drug is Propulsid, a prescription drug to treat
gastro-esophageal reflux," Hu explained, adding that there has been
no report of death confirmed to be linked to the drug here, as the
DOH has adopted a stringent pharmaceutical security management
system.</P>
      <P>Hu said that as Propulsid is likely to cause arrhythmia, the DOH
has required the supplier, Janssen-Cilag Co., to add a security
warning on its packaging. "The DOH has also asked local physicians to
exercise caution and prudence when prescribing the drug," he added.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, Hu said, the DOH had indeed received a
report concerning harmful side effects suspected of having been
caused by the use of Propulsid. "Nevertheless, there has been no
convincing evidence proving a correlation between those side effects
and the use of Propulsid," he noted.</P>
      <P>Hu further pointed out that the Pulitzer Prize-winning
investigative report, written by David Willman of the Los Angeles
Times, contains an error.</P>
      <P>"Propulsid has been marketed in the United States for more than
10 years, not just since 1993, as claimed by the American
journalist," Hu said, adding that the drug was first marketed in
Taiwan in 1991.</P>
      <P>Other U.S.-approved unsafe prescription drugs mentioned by
Willman included the digestive drug Lotronex, the weight-loss drug
Redux, the antibiotic Raxar, the anti-hypertension drug Posicor, the
painkiller Duract and the diabetes drug Rezulin. "None of those six
drugs have never been marketed in Taiwan," Hu noted.</P>
      <P>According to Willman's investigative report, the seven drugs
could be linked to as many as 1,200 deaths in the United States over
the years.</P>
      <P>Hu urged local people not to go to the United States to purchase
drugs that have not been legally marketed in Taiwan. He also advised
local doctors to forget the "superstition" that American drugs are
safer than Taiwan's own medicines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COALITION GOVERNMENT `INEVITABLE' AFTER YEAR-END ELECTION: SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A coalition government will be an
"inevitable development" after Taiwan's year-end elections, scholars
said in a seminar Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The seminar on who should lead the coalition government was
sponsored by the National Policy Foundation, an opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) think tank.</P>
      <P>The scholars said after the year-end legislative
elections, no major political parties will garner more than half of
the 220 seats in the legislature and that for the sake of political
stability, the forming of a coalition government will be inevitable.</P>
      <P>They also said that this coalition government should be led by
the political parties that collect the largest number of seats in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Professor Kao Lang of National Taiwan University stressed that
whether the opposition KMT, the People First Party and the New Party
can cooperate will have a tremendous effect on the year-end election.
If the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) does not want to
become a minority government, it will also have to join forces with
other political parties, Kao claimed.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which was defeated by the DPP in the presidential
election last year, is currently the dominant force in the
Legislative Yuan. But the PFP, a party formed after former KMT
heavyweight James Soong finished a close second in last year's
presidential election, is trying to increase its legislative seats.</P>
      <P>Wu Tung-yeh, a researcher at National Cheng Chi University, said
that as a minority government, the DPP has ended up in an
untenable political situation. For the long-term stability of the
nation, he said, a coalition government will be inevitable if no
party wins more than half of the seats.</P>
      <P>Wu added that the DPP will want to make efforts to become the
biggest political party in the election so as to take the lead in
forming the Cabinet. But, he went on, if it fails to win half of the
seats, it may still be able to operate as a minority government,
making further chaotic political development unavoidable.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN PITCHES FOR CROSS-STRAIT RELIGIOUS SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Wednesday he fully supports the proposal that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait hold a religious summit to help boost mutual
understanding and ensure permanent cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with Bawa Jain,
secretary-general of the U.N. Millennium World Religious and
Spiritual Leaders Summit Meeting, and Dena Merriam, the summit's vice
chairwoman.</P>
      <P>Noting that religion can serve as an angel of peace, Chen said he
is hopeful that spiritual faith can help build a "bridge of peace"
between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen said he fervently backs Bawa Jain's pitch for the holding of
a cross-strait religious summit to forge rapprochement and lay a
solid foundation of permanent peace in the region.</P>
      <P>The president further said he is convinced that religions have
infinite strength and can help "purify one's mind and heart."</P>
      <P>"Religions should inspire political leaders of all countries
around the world to promote economic prosperity, social progress and
the well-being of mankind with compassion, sympathy and wisdom," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that true peace can not tolerate war, Chen said
tolerance, respect and forgiveness are needed to prevent war and
safeguard peace.</P>
      <P>"Only those who lack self-confidence would instigate a war or
intimidate other people with bellicose rhetoric or live-fire military
exercises," Chen said, adding he believes that anybody who has a
compassionate heart will have no enemy and that anyone who has wisdom
will feel no worry.</P>
      <P>"And if everybody has mercy, compassion and wisdom, the world
will be more harmonious, stable, and peaceful," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In his talks, Chen also emphasized the importance of respecting
biological, religious and cultural diversity.</P>
      <P>"There should be no discrimination simply because of different
religious beliefs, races, cultural backgrounds, languages or
individual styles," Chen said, adding: "We should appreciate
diversity which offers our world various possibilities."</P>
      <P>For his part, Bawa Jain said religions can help increase mutual
understanding and stamp out violence and armed conflicts. "This is
why I have advocated the convening of a cross-strait religious summit
to promote peace in the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Bawa Jain noted that the U.N. Millennium World Religious and
Spiritual Leaders Summit Meeting, held last year, passed a
declaration renouncing the use of violence and military force. "The
United Nations has endeavored to cash in on the strength of religions
to promote world peace," he added.</P>
      <P>Bawa Jain and Dena Merriam were among the attendees of a
symposium on regional and world peace as well as environmentalism
sponsored by the Taipei-based Buddhist Dhrama Drum Mountain
Foundation, which is led by Master Sheng Yen.</P>
      <P>All foreign and domestic participants to the seminar have signed
a joint declaration on world peace. President Chen also signed the
declaration during his meeting with Bawa Jain and Dena Merriam.
Master Sheng Yen was also present at the meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC CABINET RATIFIES TWO U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Executive Yuan
ratified two U.N. human rights treaties Wednesday, 24 years after
signing them while the nation was still a member of the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said after his Cabinet ratified the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that
the two treaties are the most representative U.N. resolutions on
human rights.</P>
      <P>Chang said that ROC President Chen Shui-bian has continually
called on the Cabinet to urge the legislature to ratify the two
treaties, which will serve as the formal legal basis of human rights
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should
communicate with lawmakers to seek legislative ratification and
acquire the final presidential signature.</P>
      <P>However, as to depositing the instrument of ratification with the
U.N. secretary-general to complete the process, Chang said that this
may present a problem because the Republic of China is no longer a
U.N. member.</P>
      <P>He added that he will still ask the Foreign Ministry to handle
the matter in a committed manner in order to demonstrate the
government's determination to promote the protection of human rights.</P>
      <P>Under normal circumstances, the covenants come into force for the
state party that ratified them three months after the date of
deposit.</P>
      <P>Government spokesman Su Cheng-ping explained that the ROC
government did not complete the domestic process of ratification
after signing the two treaties in 1967 because of the sea change in
international affairs that led to the 1971 transfer of the ROC seat
in the United Nations to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Ratifying these treaties now serves to act in coordination with
the president's call for the nation to become a part of the
international human rights community.</P>
      <P>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
recognizes the basic right of all individuals in the world to
freedom, justice and peace. It condemns slavery, genocide, torture,
cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, and capital punishment for
pregnant women or persons below eighteen years of age.</P>
      <P>A total of 147 states have ratified the treaty.</P>
      <P>The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights recognizes that all peoples have the right to freely determine
their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and
cultural development. The treaty, ratified by 144 nations, also
recognizes the right to establish trade unions and go on strike.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN ASEAN: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that the government will encourage Taiwan businessmen to invest in
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received Taiwanese
businessmen operating in the Philippines and Thailand. Investment in
ASEAN nations should replace the previous administration's "southern
strategy," Chen said.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the president also reaffirmed his
determination to build Taiwan into a green silicon island and to
brace for the coming of the new era of the knowledge economy.</P>
      <P>He also said that the government will continue to assist domestic
manufacturers to invest overseas. Taiwan's ample capital, superb
technology and marketing experience can help it join forces with
Southeast Asia, which has abundant natural resources and cheap human
resources, so as to work to promote prosperity and progress in Asia
on the basis of mutual reciprocity, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that he has confidence in this land and in its 23 million
people. Though the society may seem chaotic at times, the people have
remained calm, demonstrating the historical significance of the
political changeover and democracy.</P>
      <P>The president also lauded Taiwan businessmen as being in the
vanguard of foreign trade, and expressed the hope that the Taiwan
businessmen will be able to pool together to fight for the survival
and development of the nation.</P>
      <P>The president said the everlasting development of trade is
Taiwan's lifeline, adding that the island has flourished on its
economy and trade. This is the reason that he recently advocated the
"three priorities," meaning that the economy, investment and Taiwan
will be priorities, he said.</P>
      <P>ASEAN members include Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore,
Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Burma and Cambodia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND INVESTMENT APPLICATIONS BY TWO HIGH-TECH FIRMS OK'd</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
finally made a decision Wednesday to allow two high-tech firms to
realize their investment plans in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The MOEA's Investment Commission said that it gave its approval
to the investment applications of Asustek Computer Inc. and VIA
Technologies following a detailed perusal of their investment purpose
and capital use.</P>
      <P>According to the commission, Asustek's application to remit US$25
million was a capital increment for a facility in Suzhou, while VIA's
US$12.78 million capital remittance was aimed at setting up a retail
shopping mall in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister Chen Ruei-long said the move was only a part of the
MOEA's normal screening process for investment projects bound for
both mainland China and other countries. He noted that the screening
move does not mean that the government has made any changes in its
mainland investment policy.</P>
      <P>The approval of the two applications, filed in late March, has
been viewed by the local business community as a benchmark index for
gauging whether the government will further tighten its reserved
mainland investment policy.</P>
      <P>The possible tightening move follows a rumor that mainland China
will close a Zhengjiang plant run by Tainan-based Chi Mei Corporation
in response to its chairman's support for a Japanese comic book that
whitewashed Japan's colonial rule in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Wall Street investment guru has
predicted that the 21st century will be "mainland China's century,"
and that Shanghai will be the No.1 city in Asia in 10 years.</P>
      <P>In a recent interview with the English-language Asiaweek, Jim
Rogers, co-founder with George Soros of the multi-billion Quantum
Fund, said mainland China is "the place to be."</P>
      <P>"The 21st century will not be Asia's century, but China's
century," an advance copy of the magazine released Wednesday quoted
Rogers as saying.</P>
      <P>Regarding the future of Hong Kong, he reportedly said: "I don't
think China will need Hong Kong once Shanghai gets going."</P>
      <P>According to the report, Rogers is bullish on the mainland. He
agreed that there are "great things happening in India, but in very
small pockets."</P>
      <P>"Compared to China, where great things are happening all across
the country, in India you can't get (a lot of things) even if you're
willing to pay for them," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Rogers also predicted that in 10 years there will be two great
cities in Asia -- Shanghai and Singapore. The rest of Asia's cities,
including Hong Kong, will be second-tier, he forecast.</P>
      <P>"I don't think Hong Kong will be up there ... putting money in
Hong Kong property is a waste of time. Hong Kong likes to think that
China needs it for its people. There are plenty of smart Chinese in
Shanghai and given time, they will outsmart people in Hong Kong," he
was further quoted as saying.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China military conducted a
second preview Wednesday for the "Hankuang No. 17" live-fire combined
services training exercise in Taiwan's southernmost county of
Pingtung.</P>
      <P>It was also the last preview for the annual massive-scale
Hankuang training drill, scheduled to be held Saturday at the
military's Haiko training field in Hengchun, Pingtung. The first
preview took place Monday, with Army Commander-in-Chief Chen
Chen-hsiang presiding.</P>
      <P>Military sources said this year's Hankuang exercise will focus on
testing the performance and effectiveness of the ROC's new generation
weaponry systems for land, naval and airborne defense.</P>
      <P>The military invited civilian officials and social celebrities in
the Pingtung area to witness Wednesday's preview.</P>
      <P>The powerful "Thunder 2000" multiple rocket launching system
(MRLS), developed by the Chungshan Institute of Science and
Technology (CIST), the military's research arm, also made its debut
in the preview.</P>
      <P>The "Thunder 2000" MRLS is expected to help beef up the
military's anti-landing combat capabilities. It can prevent invading
troops from operating in waters up to 28 kilometers off the Taiwan
coast, military sources said.</P>
      <P>Many other newly acquired military hardware, including the
Avenger air-defense missiles, shoulder-fired Stinger missiles and the
CIST-developed Tienkung (Sky Bow) missiles will also be test-fired in
Saturday's Hankuang exercise.</P>
      <P>The Hankuang No. 17 exercise covers two stages -- cyberwar games
and live-fire combined services drills. The cyberwar games were held
in Taipei early this month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2ND MAINLAND FREIGHTER MAKES DIRECT SAILING TO KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland Chinese freighter sailed
directly from the southeastern mainland province of Fujian to the
Republic of China-held frontline island of Kinmen Wednesday, marking
yet another breakthrough in the "mini three links" program.</P>
      <P>The 198-ton mainland cargo ship transported 300 tons of gravel
to Kinmen, which was ordered by a local construction firm.</P>
      <P>It was the second mainland freighter to make a direct voyage to
Kinmen since Taiwan opened its two offshore defense outposts --
Kinmen and Matsu -- for direct trade, mail and shipping links with
mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei ports in Fujian province, commonly
known as the "mini three links," at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>On March 31, a Guangdong province-registered freighter, with
400 cubic meters of granite chips on board, made its maiden direct
voyage to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>With previous experience in handling customs clearance, Kinmen
harbor officials and customs inspection officers operated all
relevant affairs smoothly when the second mainland freighter arrived
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Several Kinmen county officials and councilors turned up at the
Liaolo port to welcome the arrival of the mainland cargo ship.
Councilor Hsieh I-chang said as gravel from mainland China is 30
percent cheaper than Taiwan's, direct gravel import from the mainland
will be a boon to Kinmen's infrastructure construction.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he is hopeful that other mainland construction
materials and consumer products can also be shipped directly to
Kinmen to make the "mini three links" program really take off.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has been reluctant to take active steps to
facilitate the Taiwan-proposed "mini three links" program. It

    <HEADLINE>TSMC SUSPENDS CONSTRUCTION OF NEW 12-INCH WAFER PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,    Taiwan,   April   18   (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) President Tseng Fan-cheng said Wednesday
that the construction of his company's 15th wafer fabrication plant
will be put on hold indefinitely as a result of the sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>Tseng likened the semiconductor manufacturing industry's
inability to predict when market conditions will rebound to "a walk
in the mists." He added that the recent industry-wide economic gloom
has had far-reaching effects, but his company has no plans to lay off
workers.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that there is a global oversupply of many electronics
products, and that many downstream clients are apprehensive of
placing new orders. This signifies a lack of consumer confidence, he
continued, adding that many companies made errors of judgment when
the economy was hot, leading to overproduction.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that although only about half of his company's
production capacity will be used in the next few months, TSMC is
unlikely to run into the red during this quarter at least.</P>
      <P>He said that the 14th TSMC 12-inch wafer plant will continue
construction as scheduled because it will take seven to eight months
to complete it, and that "it may be too late" if the company were to
shelve the construction until the economy picks up.</P>
      <P>However, despite having already held a groundbreaking ceremony
for the 15th plant, the company is putting its construction on hold.</P>

      <P>Former Republic of

Wednesday, with the Navy Headquarters conferring the Order of the
Cloud and Banner of the sixth class on him in recognition of his
contribution to the innovation of the ROC Navy's warships during his

      <P>The conferring ceremony was held at the home of Yin's father Yin

      <P>Yin Dwo said that although this justice comes late, the
conferring of the order is an affirmation of Yin's attempts to
maintain the national interests during his lifetime. He added that he

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE P.M. CANDIDATES SUPPORT ISSUING VISA TO EX-ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Huang Kuei-mei and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three of the four candidates running for
prime minister in Japan said Wednesday that they support granting a
visa to former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui for
humanitarian reasons.</P>
      <P>Junichiro Koizumi, a former health minister, said at a joint
press conference with the other candidates that Lee's visa
application should be approved on both humanitarian and health
grounds. He had earlier expressed reservations, saying that the issue
should be resolved after considering the overall three-way ties
between Beijing, Taipei and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Shizuka Kamei, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
policy research council, said that Lee "of course" should be allowed
to visit Japan. He had suggested a few days earlier that Foreign
Minister Yohei Kono and Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda be removed for
their opposition to granting Lee a visa.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Economics Minister Taro Aso, who is also running for
prime minister candidate, said that as the owner of a hospital, he
understands that the kind of surgery Lee needs is not simple. He
added that the hospital Lee hopes to visit indeed has the best
equipment, and that he believes the former president of the Republic
of China should be allowed to visit Japan from a humanitarian
standpoint.</P>
      <P>The only candidate who expressed reservations was former prime
minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who said that he has already pointed out
on many occasions that the issue should not be overly politicized.
Now that the issue has become too complicated, it will not be easy to
resolve, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee, who complained of chest pains after a trip to the Czech
Republic last October and underwent successful coronary angioplasty
surgery in Taiwan in November, plans to visit Japan for continued
treatment by the same Japanese doctor who oversaw his operation.</P>
      <P>However, the Japanese government, which has come under pressure
from Beijing to deny Lee's application, has yet to announce its
decision.</P>
      <P>ROC Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said that Lee's
reason for wanting to visit Japan is very simple, and that she hopes
Japan will quickly make a positive decision out of a humanitarian
spirit.</P>
      <P>Chang was responding to incumbent Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori's statement earlier in the day at a press conference to announce
his resignation that a decision on the issue will be made from a
humanitarian standpoint together with other "international
circumstantial considerations."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT$1.52 MILLION LOTTERY TO BE STARTED NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Want to win NT$50 million (US$1.52
million) overnight? With the establishment of Taiwan's new lottery,
you'll have the chance to be a millionaire starting next year.</P>
      <P>Taipei Bank, which was chosen over four other hopefuls by the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) to issue both traditional and computerized
lottery tickets, announced Wednesday that it will start to administer
three types of charity lotteries starting Jan. 20, 2002.</P>
      <P>Liao Cheng-Ching, chairman of Taipei Bank, said that the three
types of lotteries -- traditional, instant and computerized charity
lotteries -- will offer winning rates of between 5 and 15 percent,
10 and 33 percent, and 1 and 5 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Liao said that the traditional lotteries will only be run on
special occasions six times a year, with the ticket sales period
between one and two months. This type of lottery will target more
conservative patrons who buy the lottery tickets out of nostalgia or
the desire to win a fortune. One traditional lottery ticket will cost
NT$100 (US$3), and the biggest prize will be 200,000 times that.</P>
      <P>The instant lottery will be a new game with the sales period
between two and three months. This lottery, 15 issues a year, will
target patrons motivated by fun or curiosity, and tickets will
cost NT$50, NT$100 and NT$150. The biggest prize will be 50,000 times
the ticket's face value.</P>
      <P>The computerized charity lotteries will be held two times per
week, with 104 issues through the year and a ticket sales period of
between three and seven days. Targeting speculative patrons who want
to get rich overnight, the lottery's tickets will cost NT$50 and
NT$100. The grand prize will be set at 500,000 times the ticket's
face value.</P>
      <P>Liao also announced the establishment of a lottery charity
foundation that will channel 35 percent of net lottery profits to
charities, so as to step up the caring for elderly and less
privileged groups, provide support for youth, and nurture elite
athletes.</P>
      <P>He also said that the bank will set up a service center for
less privileged groups to help them apply for lottery operation
licenses.</P>
      <P>Under the management of Taipei Bank, the lottery is expected to
add more than NT$39 billion in tax revenues to the nation's coffers,
as well as to help certain industrial sectors and the domestic
employment market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Cornell University announced Wednesday
that former President of the Republic of China Lee Teng-hui will make
a private visit to his alma mater May 2-4.</P>
      <P>Cornell said that Lee will visit his granddaughter, who is
currently studying at the school, and announce the establishment of
the Lee Teng-hui Institute for scientific research. Lee is not
expected to make any public speeches or other activities during his
stay there.</P>
      <P>This will be Lee's second visit to his alma mater since he
received his Ph.D. degree in agricultural economics in 1968.</P>
      <P>Lee last visited Cornell while serving as ROC president in June
1995, during which he made a resounding speech titled "Always in My
Heart."</P>
      <P>Cornell said that the Lee Teng-hui Institute for scientific
research will be housed in the US$62.5 million Duffield Hall. Several
Taiwan companies have made generous donations, but Cornell would not
divulge the exact figures until Lee's arrival.</P>
      <P>Cornell earlier set up a Lee Teng-hui Professorship of World
Affairs to pay tribute to Lee's outstanding achievements after his
supporters in Taiwan donated US$2.5 million to the university in
1994.</P>
      <P>Construction on Duffield Hall will start in late May and is
expected to be completed in 2003.</P>
      <P>David Duffield, founder of computer software PeopleSoft and
another Cornell alumnus, donated US$20 million to his alma mater, so
the building for nanotechnology research was named after him. Earlier

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ranjit Gupta, director general of the
India-Taipei Association (ITA), arrived at Kinmen Wednesday with his
wife for a two-day private visit to the Republic of China's frontline
island.</P>
      <P>The Guptas called on Kinmen Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai immediately
after their arrival on the island to gain a better understanding of
the "mini three links" between Kinmen and the mainland Chinese city
of Xiamen.</P>
      <P>The so-called "mini three links" refer to direct transport, trade
and postal connections between Kinmen and Xiamen, as well as between
Matzu, another ROC frontline island, and the mainland Chinese city of
Mawei.</P>
      <P>On the development of the cross-strait "mini three links," Gupta
said that seeking peaceful coexistence is now a world trend. He
praised Taiwan's efforts in pushing for the implementation of the
"mini three links," which started on Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Gupta said that the "one China" dispute should be solved through
negotiations between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and
mainland China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Beijing has until now shown a lukewarm attitude toward Taiwan's
unilateral implementation of the "mini three links." Officials there
now say that as Taiwan claims "one China" can only a topic on the
agenda of cross-strait talks, the "mini three links" are local in
nature and exchanges need to be ratified on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Beijing insists that "one China" be considered the principle for
cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Kinmen County Government officials, the Guptas also
toured some scenic spots in Kinmen, including a battlefield at

    <HEADLINE>FALUN GONG FOLLOWERS DISAPPOINTED AT U.N. COMMISSION'S DECISION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,   April  18  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Falun Gong spiritual movement
expressed disappointment Wednesday over the U.N. Commission on Human
Rights' decision not to discuss a U.S.-sponsored proposal to condemn
Communist China's human rights record.</P>
      <P>"It is a shame that some countries have turned a blind eye to
China's horrible abuses," Falun Gong's overseas practitioners said in
a statement which warned Communist Chinese President Jiang Zemin not
to take this vote as a license to kill.</P>
      <P>Tens of millions of followers of Falun Gong and other spiritual
groups have been stripped of their basic rights, often illegally
arrested, beaten, tortured, and even raped, according to the
statement.</P>
      <P>It noted that after China escaped censure by the same United
Nations forum last year, the crackdown on Falun Gong escalated
drastically, with killings increasing from 11 in 1999 to 193 in 2000.</P>
      <P>During this year's U.N. human rights commission session in
Geneva, the statement pointed out, at least 15 Falun Gong
practitioners have been murdered while in custody in mainland China.</P>
      <P>"There is no excuse for killing and brutalizing peace-loving
citizens," it added.</P>
      <P>"There is nothing China's leadership fears more than the world
learning of its crimes, and, the vote aside, this is what has
happened here in Geneva," said Erping Zhang from Geneva. He and Cindy
Gu were in the Swiss city to monitor the U.N. commission meeting.</P>
      <P>In the statement, they quoted Martin Luther King Jr., who in 1963
said that "we will have to repent in this generation not merely for
the hateful words and actions of the bad people, but also for the
appalling silence of the good people."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINTAINING 5% GROWTH THIS YEAR A TOUGH TASK: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi said
Thursday that it will be a tough task to try to maintain a five
percent economic growth rate this year.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while fielding questions during a joint
meeting of the budget and economic committees at the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the domestic economy has been sluggish over the
past six months. As the economic growth rate in the United States,
the major export destination of Taiwan products, is expected to be
only 1.2 percent this year, with some predicting it to be as low as
zero percent, the task of maintaining a five percent growth rate for
Taiwan's economy will be a difficult one, he said.</P>
      <P>In responding to an interpellation by Legislator Kuo Su-chun of
the major opposition Kuomintang (KMT), Lin said the type of Taiwan
businesses heading to mainland China to set up shop have shifted from
those from traditional industries to those in high-tech industries,
and from small- and medium-sized enterprises to large-scale
enterprises. The nation needs to closely monitor the source of the
capital and its outflow, he added.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Sheng-liang of the KMT said that foreign investors
have been deterred from coming to Taiwan because of the nation's
wavering economic policy, citing the examples of Bayer's canceling of
its plan to invest in Taiwan, the controversy surrounding the
suspension of construction of the fourth nuclear power plant, and the
suspension of a proposed reservoir project in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The most urgent task now, Lin said, is to improve the local
investment environment, including land, capital, talent and tax
incentives, adding that to do this will require cooperation from
local governments.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's tax incentives are not particularly "generous" or
"competitive" in comparison with other countries, he noted.</P>
      <P>He also said that since the five-day workweek was put into
practice this year, some 12 percent of Taiwan's manufacturers have
said that they would cut production, while some 21 percent have said
that they will try to shift overseas, thereby demonstrating that the
government needs to improve Taiwan's investment environment.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyh-bao of the opposition New Party also
said that the economic minister can be considered the chairman
of the nation's enterprise chairmen, and he asked whether the
minister will take the lead in luring more foreign investment to the
island.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Industrial Development Bureau Director
General Shih Yen-hsiang is currently visiting Japan to woo
investors, and he would like to join Shih for the efforts when the
talk comes to a crucial stage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC DELEGATION TO TRAVEL TO U.S. FOR ARMS PROCUREMENT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China military delegation
will head to the United States Friday for talks with their U.S.
counterparts on the ROC's weaponry procurement plans for 2001,
military sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The annual ROC-U.S. arms procurement meeting is scheduled to open
April 24 in suburban Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>The ROC delegation will be headed by Vice Chief of the General
Staff Gen. Hou Shou-yeh, and its members will include Chen Lan-chun,
director of the Procurement Bureau of the Ministry of National
Defense (MND), and officials from the General Staff Headquarters.</P>
      <P>MND sources said the delegation has made full preparations for
the upcoming meeting.</P>
      <P>"We have carefully evaluated our defense needs and the weaponry
items that the United States may agree to sell," said an MND official
who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>He said the military has also completed a detailed budget
planning report in connection with this year's arms procurement
project.</P>
      <P>"The delegation will brief American negotiators on our shopping
list and relevant budget planning," the official explained.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government is now reviewing Taiwan's arms shopping list
and will make a decision on it after discussion with the ROC
delegation.</P>
      <P>Judging from recent statements and actions taken by senior
military officials, the advanced Aegis radar system-equipped Arleigh
Burke-class destroyers remain at the top of the ROC's shopping
package.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, senior military officials said they generally don't
think that the U.S. government is likely to approve the sale to
Taiwan of the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers this year. They said the
Bush administration may instead agree to sell Taiwan the cutting-edge
Aegis battle management radar system first and then sell the
destroyers in the future.</P>
      <P>As mainland China strongly opposes U.S. sales of Aegis-equipped
destroyers to Taiwan, military officials said it would be a nice
alternative if the United States agrees to sell Taiwan the Aegis
anti-aircraft and anti-missile radar system first and negotiate sales
of destroyers to bear the Aegis system in the future.</P>
      <P>In addition, MND sources said, the United States may take the
initiative to suggest that Taiwan purchase four Kidd-class destroyers
to upgrade its Navy's long-distance combat capability before
purchasing the more advanced Arleigh Burke-class vessels.</P>
      <P>As for the P3C anti-submarine aircraft, the sources said, the
Bush administration may agree to sell Taiwan this type of warplane.
Nevertheless, the ROC Navy's procurement principle is that the
Aegis-equipped destroyers and P3C anti-submarine aircraft should be
purchased simultaneously because they are designed to complement each
other.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, military observers said if the United States rejects
Taiwan's request to purchase the Aegis-equipped destroyers, it is
likely to sell Taiwan diesel submarines, weapons that the island has
long desired to buy.</P>
      <P>Military experts said there may be one or two breakthroughs in
the upcoming arms procurement talks. But they stressed that during
the course of negotiations, the United States certainly will give the
top priority to its own national interests.</P>
      <P>Of course, the experts added, the United States will also take
into account Taiwan's actual defense needs. And the general
atmosphere of the delicate Taipei-Washington-Beijing triangular ties
is also expected to influence the results of the talks, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-ROC PREMIER TO VISIT MAINLAND CHINA TO PITCH FOR 'COMMON MARKET'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19 (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China Premier Vincent
Siew said Thursday he will file an application with the government
in the next few days for a visit to mainland China to pitch for the
formation of a "common market" across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Siew, also a vice chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), said he tentatively plans to visit the mainland from May 8-15
in his capacity as chairman of the newly founded Cross-Strait Common
Market Foundation. Siew will be accompanied by the foundation's
directors and supervisors on his mainland visit.</P>
      <P>In accordance with current ROC regulations, Siew must apply for
a government approval of his mainland visit because he once served
as a high-ranking political appointee with access to national
security affairs.</P>
      <P>Siew said he most likes to meet with relevant mainland Chinese
scholars or think tanks to discuss his idea of forming a European
Union-style cross-strait common market during his mainland visit.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he will meet with mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, Siew declined to
make any comment. He just said the itinerary of his planned mainland
visit has yet to be finalized.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Siew explained in detail his cross-strait
common market proposal at a seminar on mainland China-bound
investment and protection of Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>Siew pointed out that the formation of a cross-strait common
market can facilitate integration of Taiwan and mainland China under
the current trends of globalization and regional cooperation.</P>
      <P>"The establishment of a cross-strait common market is also
expected to help ease tensions in the Taiwan Strait and open up a
new era of cross-strait peaceful co-existence and development," Siew
noted.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that his cross-strait common market overture
emphasizes the EU spirit. "I think that the EU development model of
moving from economic integration to political integration can
provide a lot of inspiration for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
in developing a cross-strait common market."</P>
      <P>In his view, Siew said, the foundation for promoting a
cross-strait common market lies in the exclusion of political
considerations.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Siew said, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
uphold their "1992 consensus," which allows both sides to "agree to
disagree" on the definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>Siew further said confidently that if the proposed cross-strait
common market can be developed successfully, it will contribute much
to regional economic development and stability and even bring new
growth vitality to the global economy.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping resolve their decades-old political and
economic conflicts, Siew said, the formation of a cross-strait common
market will also allow the two sides to move from economic
integration to political integration and enable their people to
enjoy prosperity and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Noting that the proposed cross-strait common market mechanism
should be forged gradually, Siew said the two sides should promote
normalization of bilateral trade and economic relations in the first
stage.</P>
      <P>In the second phase, Siew said, the two sides should form a "free
trade zone" by harmonizing their economic systems. "In the third
stage, the two sides should form a customs alliance, and in the
fourth phase, they should complete all-out economic integration to
realize the goal of cross-strait common market," he explained.</P>
      <P>Siew urged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to forge an
official consultative mechanism and adopt confidence-building
measures to accelerate normalization of cross-strait trade and
economic ties.</P>
      <P>Siew alo called for forward-looking adjustments of Taiwan's
current "go slow, be patient" policy on mainland China-bound
investment and the lifting of bans on direct trade, mail and
transport links in line with the general new market trends.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN REPORTEDLY TO DECIDE WHETHER TO ISSUE VISA SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Whether former President Lee Teng-hui of
the Republic of China will get a visa to enter Japan is still not
clear, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the Republic of China is still waiting for the
final word from Japan, and she expressed the hope that Japan will
make its decision soon.</P>
      <P>Reports from Japan said that after days of debate and
deliberation, Japan's policy is that it will issue the visa in one or
two days as long as the former ROC head agrees that he will only
travel to the hospital in Okayama prefecture in central Japan for
medical treatment for his heart problem and will not engage in any
political activities.</P>
      <P>Reports also said that Japan is now trying to learn whether Lee
is willing to agree to such conditions.</P>
      <P>Su Chih-cheng, Lee's former personal secretary, would not
speculate on the possibility of Lee's visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>Su said Japan might not submit conditions to Lee, noting that the
former ROC president had categorically said that he would not sneak
into Japan and would not sign any conditional papers.</P>
      <P>Japanese media reporters had asked Lee earlier whether he would
use Japan's policy that allows a 72-hour period of entry without a
visa for ROC nationals to seek medical treatment. Lee responded by
saying unequivocally that he will travel to Japan in an open manner
as the former ROC head, and will not sneak into Japan.</P>
      <P>According to friends arranging Lee's visit to Japan, the Japanese
government has to issue the visa by Friday at the latest. Otherwise,
it will be too late for Lee to visit Sunday, and the whole trip will
have to be rearranged, they added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, although Cornell University in upstate New York has
announced that Lee will visit his alma mater May 2-4, Lee's aides
would not comment on whether Japan's delayed issue of a visa will
affect Lee's trip to the United States.</P>
      <P>In related developments, several Taiwanese legislators suggested
cross-party cooperation to revise the law so as to allow Japanese
doctors to come to Taiwan to treat Lee.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Kuang-hua of the opposition Kuomintang said that
in case Japan denies the visa to Lee, one way to solve the problem
would be to suggest that the Department of Health revise the law to
allow in foreign doctors to treat local patients on a case-by-case
basis. The other way would be to revise the regulations to allow the
Japanese doctor treating Lee to Taiwan to provide treatment.</P>
      <P>Liu also said that the Japanese doctor will be able to come to
Taiwan as long as his suggestion is supported by all parties, passed
in the Legislative Yuan, and signed into law by President Chen
Shui-bian within one week.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Yi-chiao of the opposition People First Party
noted that under the current situation, all former ROC presidents, no
matter what their party affiliations, have found themselves
"confined" to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As other countries may excel in other medical fields, there is a
need to revise the law so as not to compromise the health of the
former presidents, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyh-bao of the New Party said that he has
confidence in Taiwan's medical care system, but the revision of the
law would provide another choice for people more confident in the
medical standards of other countries.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said in a
breakfast meeting Thursday that all officials should make their
strongest effort to improve Taiwan's economic development and
employment rate, even though the task is difficult in this period of
global economic sluggishness.</P>
      <P>Several government officials, including Vice Premier Lai In-jaw

      <P>Chen Po-chih said that in order to raise Taiwan's employment
rate, it is important to create job opportunities and woo investment,
adding that the Council for Economic Planning and Development has
made these two points its focus in promoting an economic revival.</P>
      <P>The officials added that the government expects to create 100,000
more job opportunities through its expansion of public investment and
its move to reserve jobs usually filled by foreign workers for Taiwan
residents.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government has worked to improve the investment
environment, bolster traditional industries and businesses, and host
international business fairs in a bid to trigger growth in private

    <HEADLINE>PARLIAMENTARY REFORM BILLS TO BE PASSED BY OCTOBER: DPP HEAVYWEIGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday he will push for
revisions of current laws to ensure smoother parliamentary
operations.</P>
      <P>Shen, also chief executive of the DPP's central policy
coordination commission, said he has reached a consensus with
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng on revising the existing
parliamentary organization law and the legislative power enforcement
law to upgrade the parliament's operational efficiency and image.</P>
      <P>Shen said current parliamentary operational laws contain many
unreasonable and outdated rules that have hindered smooth operations
of the country's legislative assembly.</P>
      <P>For instance, Shen said that under current regulations, a single
legislator can veto a decision to include a bill into the agenda for
the legislature's plenary sessions or meetings of its standing
committees. In addition, it needs only five lawmakers to form a
subgroup in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Shen said he has twice met with Wang to discuss the issue. "Wang
has promised to ask the Legislative Yuan's legal affairs bureau to
draft relevant revision bills," he said, adding that the DPP
legislative caucus is also integrating various reform proposals and
will work together with the legal affairs bureau and legislative
caucuses of other political parties to come up with final versions
of revision bills to existing laws.</P>
      <P>Shen said he is confident that the legislature will be able to
pass relevant revision bills before the next parliamentary session
ends at the end of October.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Shen said, the new Legislative Yuan, to be
elected late this year, will operate more smoothly and
efficiently.</P>
      <P>Shen also stressed the importance of the functions of political
parties in ensuring smooth parliamentary operations, claiming that
independent lawmakers are often "the sources of disorder or chaos"
in the parliament.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a proposal by a DPP subgroup in the parliament
that the number of parliamentary seats be halved, Shen said it takes
time to complete necessary constitutional amendments to implement
such a proposal.</P>
      <P>"I don't think we have enough time left this year to push for the
passage of a constitutional amendment to pave the way for halving
the number of parliamentary seats," Shen noted, adding that it will
take at least four years to complete legal preparations for
implementing such a reform proposal that will have profound impact
on the domestic political operations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan exports to the United States
sank to a 24-month low of US$2.56 billion in February, down 11.1
percent, or US$320 million, from the same month in 2000, according to
the latest statistics released by the U.S. Department of Commerce.</P>
      <P>The figure represents a fall of four consecutive months since
last October, in which Taiwan outbound shipments to the United States
hit a record high of US$3.7 billion, the government tallies show.
They also indicate that February's level was also a drop of US$500
million from January.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taiwan imports from the United States still
registered noticeable growth, rising 10.9 percent to reach US$1.76
billion in February. That left the island with a trade surplus of
US$800 million, down 36 percent from January, the statistics
indicate.</P>
      <P>Affected by declining exports to the United States since the end
of last year, Taiwan was edged out by Holland as the ninth-largest
source of U.S. imports. At the same time, Taiwan also became the
eighth-largest source of the U. S. trade deficit, falling from its
previous sixth spot.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP CALLS FOR ROC-US COOPERATION TO CREATE `A BRIGHTER FUTURE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu called Thursday for closer cooperation between the ROC and the
United States so as to jointly create "a brighter future for both
parties in the 21st century."</P>
      <P>Lu made the appeal during a tea party she hosted in honor of a
50-member delegation from Irvine City, San Francisco, which arrived
in Taipei earlier this week for a goodwill visit.</P>
      <P>The main objective of the delegation led by Irvine City Mayor
Larry Agran is to sign with northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County an
agreement on the establishment of sisterhood ties between the two
sides, a move pushed for by Lu when she served as Taoyuan county
magistrate.</P>
      <P>Lu said that it was a great pleasure for her to receive the U.S.
delegation in the Presidential Office as she did not expect to be
able to meet with the distinguished guests in the capacity of ROC
vice president.</P>
      <P>She told the delegation members it was "really unimaginable" for
a woman like her -- who had been jailed for the 1979 Formosa Magazine
incident -- to become ROC vice president, while Chen Shui-bian, the
lawyer for the victims of the incident, was elected president.</P>
      <P>"This democratic miracle was jointly created by all the people of
Taiwan," the first ROC female vice president stressed, adding that
the democratic achievement should be cherished by all the compatriots
of the island country.</P>
      <P>Hailing Irvine City as "an ideal place to live," Lu said the
Irvine authorities have focused their efforts on both environmental
protection and the promotion of social well-being. The vice president
voiced the hope that both parties can further boost bilateral
cooperation.</P>
      <P>For his part, Agran spoke highly of Taiwan's democratic
achievements, saying that the inauguration of a new government
represents the realization of a political ideal. He also said he
expects both sides to strengthen exchanges and cooperation in the
near future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITINERARY FOR ROC PRESIDENT'S SECOND TRIP TO LATIN AMERICA ANNOUNCED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 19 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office announced Thursday
the official itinerary for Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian's upcoming second state visit to five ROC allies in Latin
America.</P>
      <P>Deputy Presidential Secretary-General Eugene Chien said at a
press conference that Chen is scheduled to embark on his 14-day trip
to El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Paraguay and Honduras May 21, a
day after his first anniversary in office.</P>
      <P>He will be accompanied by his wife, local entrepreneurs and
legislators, as well as national security, foreign affairs,
economics, agricultural, science and labor officials.</P>
      <P>Chien said that the president's visit is meaningful in three
particular ways:</P>
      <P>First, the president is slated to attend a summit meeting in El
Salvador with leaders of the Republic of China's Central American
allies. In addition to strengthening multilateral relations, the
summit and the establishment of a strategic alliance with this region
of the world will demonstrate Taiwan's ability and desire to
participate in international society.</P>
      <P>Second, because Chen and his wife's involvement in Taiwan's
democracy movements, from the early days to the first peaceful
transfer of political power to an opposition party last year, mirrors
the island's democratic development progress, their visit to ROC
allies will be an affirmation of Taiwan's democratic achievements
that will garner widespread international recognition.</P>
      <P>Third, as a sovereign nation, the Republic of China needs to step
out into the international arena frequently to see the world and be
seen by the world.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Chen will also tour a new residential community
in El Salvador built with the assistance of Taiwan's largest charity
-- the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation -- after that
country was rattled by two devastating earthquakes early this year.</P>
      <P>Chen made his first overseas visit as ROC head of state last
August, on a trip that took him to the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica
and Nicaragua, as well as the African countries of The Gambia,
Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN TAIWAN SMOKE: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19  (CNA)
(By C.M. Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the hazards of tobacco to human
health, millions of people in Taiwan still smoke, according to the
findings of a recent survey.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by National Taiwan University's College of
Public Health, shows that 47.29 percent of males over 18 in Taiwan
smoke, while the rate for female smokers in the same age group is
much lower at only 5.23 percent.</P>
      <P>Public health experts have estimated that about 4 million people
in Taiwan smoke, or nearly one in every five persons. The average age
for a first try of a cigarette is between 18.5 years and 19.9 years.</P>
      <P>The findings show that 37.92 percent of male smokers smoke daily,
while the rest smoke occasionally. Regular smokers make up 3.25
percent of the female smokers. The heaviest smokers consume 30
cigarettes a day, compared with the less than 20 a month for the
lightest smokers.</P>
      <P>The current smoking rate for men shows a slight decrease compared
with the 50.07 percent recorded in 1993 and the 51.89 percent
recorded in 1996. However, the present rate for women has increased
in comparison with the 2.82 percent recorded in 1993 and the 4.63
percent recorded in 1996.</P>
      <P>Public health experts have warned that smoking increases the risk
of cancer of the lung, kidney, bladder and oropharynx, while it is
also associated with heart disease and other serious illnesses.</P>
      <P>They estimate that by 2025, some 10 million people in the world
will die annually of smoking-related diseases, with 2 million being
today's children and youths. In addition to human lives, the health
costs of smoking-related diseases will also be tremendous, they
added.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Cornell University official said
Wednesday that former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's
visit to the university in May will be low key and private.</P>
      <P>Vice President for University Relations Henrik N. Dullea said
that during Lee's three-day stay at Cornell University, he will only
meet with his granddaughter, who is studying there, and will not hold
any public activities. He noted that Lee's coming visit to Cornell --
his alma mater -- will be very different from an earlier visit he
made in 1995.</P>
      <P>Dullea revealed that Lee had originally wished to make the visit
in last December but was unable to do so because of his health
condition. He also described as "untrue" a Taiwan media report that
claimed Cornell University President Hunter R. Rawlings III had
traveled to Taiwan in recent months to make arrangements for Lee's
visit.</P>
      <P>Dullea stressed that Lee's visit to Cornell University will be
purely private in nature and that he will not take part in any public
activities or hold any news conferences. But he pointed out that Lee
will preside over a donation ceremony to Cornell University and will
personally announce the establishment of the "Lee Teng-hui
Institute for Scientific Research."</P>
      <P>In recognition of Lee's outstanding contribution, Cornell
University in 1994 set up a "Lee Teng-hui Professorship of World
Affairs" which operates with a US$2.5 million donation by friends of
Lee.</P>
      <P>According to Cornell University, Lee is slated to fly from Los
Angeles May 2 to Ithaca, where Cornell University is located, and to
stay there until May 4.</P>
      <P>Cornell University started to arrange for Lee's early May visit
about a month ago and did not make public his itinerary until Tuesday
after the U.S. State Department agreed to issue an entry visa for
Lee.</P>

"constructive improvements" on bilateral relations, especially during
Chen's stopover in the United States next month.</P>

Thursday that President Chen Shui-bian will be "fairly treated"
during his stopovers in the United States in May.</P>
      <P>"The Bush administration should `treat fairly' the Republic of

      <P>Lu also vowed that she will not visit the United States in her

      <P>The vice president said that she was not allowed to attend a

    <HEADLINE>STUDENTS PROTEST GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF MP3 CAMPUS RAID INCIDENT (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of university students protested
Thursday the Ministry of Education's handling of student rights after
a high-profile campus search last week ended with the seizure of 14
computers owned by students accused of downloading MP3 files.</P>
      <P>Calling themselves the Taiwan Democratic Student Movement
Alliance, the group of approximately 10 students gathered in front of
the ministry and released a statement signed by various university
student organizations and social movement groups from across the
island.</P>
      <P>In the statement, the alliance accused the ministry of allowing
prosecutors to enter a college campus "illegally" and "arrest"
students.</P>
      <P>The students also accused the ministry of enforcing a large-scale
crackdown on campus Web sites containing MP3 files, as if the
ministry were a "police headquarters for the sole use of financial
groups."</P>
      <P>The statement was referring to the music industry, represented by
the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI),
whose Taiwan branch office was quick to throw its weight behind last
week's search operation and even went so far as to say that it will
settle for nothing less than conviction of the offenders.</P>
      <P>The student alliance went on to criticize the ministry for
immediately judging that the 14 students were guilty of breaking the
law when "society is still debating" whether the act of downloading
MP3 files from the Internet is illegal.</P>
      <P>The students also accused the ministry of threatening their
rights to assembly by telling them not to band together to protest
the search. Clearly asking the students to admit guilt, the ministry
also urged the students to settle with the IFPI out of court even
though the organization has yet to file a suit, the student alliance
added.</P>
      <P>The students called for a complete re-evaluation of
copyright-related laws, particularly the aspects involving personal
and educational use.</P>
      <P>In an open letter to the Ministry of Justice, the alliance
claimed that most countries are still debating whether corporate and
organizational users should be included in the scope of punishment
for intellectual property rights "violations." The debate has yet to
expand to cover individual users, the alliance said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the students accused Taiwan's government agencies of
"inappropriately" announcing that downloading MP3 files is illegal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a legal expert on intellectual property rights said at
a seminar sponsored by the Ministry of Education to advocate
intellectual property rights that if the process of creating an MP3
file does not involve permission from its copyright owner, it is
illegal.</P>
      <P>As for downloading that file, unless it is in line with the scope
of "legally accepted reasonable usage," the act is still illegal,
added Chou Tien, director of the Institute of Information Industry's
Technology Law Center.</P>
      <P>Chou said that current rulings on the legality of MP3 downloads
are made on a case-by-case basis, but that the more these cases are
ruled illegal, the easier it is for precedents to influence later
rulings toward the same conclusion.

      <P>He added that the outcome of the case of the 14 National Cheng
Kung University students has yet to be determined by looking into the
computers confiscated by the prosecutors to see whether the quantity
of MP3 files on those computers and other related factors constitute
legal personal non-commercial use.</P>
      <P>Chou also recommended that future amendments to the Copyright Law
must take into consideration both the rights of copyright owners and
those of users. He called for a strengthening of Copyright Law
education and respect for self-disciplined autonomy on college
campuses.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party voiced his support for the students, claiming that simply
downloading music and videos from the Internet for personal or home
usage constitutes normal, legal behavior that is similar to recording
programs off cable or broadcast television for home viewing.</P>
      <P>Legislator Su Huan-chih charged that the prosecutor's
unprecedented search of student dorms heralds the coming of an era of
"Internet white terror" for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He asserted that the students were not in violation of copyright
laws because they did not burn the MP3 files onto CDs for commercial
profit, and that the Web site operators who put the MP3 files on the
Web for others to download were the real copyright violators.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY LEGISLATOR PROPOSES `CROSS-STRAIT THREE LINKS' BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Party Legislator Cheng Lung-shui
proposed Friday that Taiwan initiate direct air and sea transport
links with mainland China, or the "cross-strait three links," soon in
order to accelerate business and trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he will push to have his draft of the "cross-strait
three links" bill, being submitted to the Legislative Yuan, screened
next month, pointing out that he expects that a three-reading passage
of the bill before the end of this year will enable Taiwan to
formally implement the program Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Noting that two-way trade between Taiwan and mainland China
reached US$30.5 billion last year while Taiwan became mainland
China's fifth largest trading partner, Cheng said business
interactions across the Taiwan Strait are now an undeniable and
irresistible trend that should be properly guided rather than
blocked.</P>
      <P>In the draft bill proposed by Cheng, he calls for the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation to be authorized to be the
presiding agency responsible for conducting direct working-level
talks with relevant or counterpart mainland Chinese groups for the
implementation of the "cross-strait three links" bill.</P>
      <P>Under the bill, Cheng also proposes that the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications publicizes before Jan. 1, 2002, the
names of the Taiwan seaports and airports to be designated as
locations for carrying out the "cross-strait three links" bill.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Cheng's proposal, Fu Don-cheng, director of the
Department of Economic Affairs under the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), said whether the timing is now right for Taiwan to implement
the "cross-strait three links" needs to be considered further.</P>
      <P>Fu said that the "cross-strait three links" issue is one that
both Taiwan and mainland China must face. As the opening of such
links involves many issues in various different areas, the MAC is
thoroughly assessing related plans in the hope that the links will be
initiated at the right time and with adequate safeguards for the
nation's security and the Taiwan people's interests.</P>

      <P>A group of legislators from both ruling

to push for early passage of a package of bills aimed at reforming
the Legislative Yuan and "purifying" campaign activities.</P>

the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Chou Hsi-wei and Liu

the Supra-party Alliance announced their decision at a joint press
conference.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers pledged to press for passage of a total of 51
bills in 13 categories related to parliamentary reforms and
neutralization of civil service before the expiration of the tenure
of office of the Fourth Legislative Yuan late this year.</P>
      <P>Lai said the package of reform bills include those related to

primaries, eradication of vote-buying, violence and organized crime
from campaign activities.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, seven categories of the bills are pending
screening by the legislature's various standing committees and the
remaining six categories are pending deliberation at the parliament's
plenary sessions.</P>
      <P>Under present regulations governing parliamentary operations, if
those bills fail to pass relevant standing committees before the end

operations and upgrading the image of the legislative assembly, Lai
said he and some of his colleagues feel compelled to press for the
passage of all those critical bills before their terms of office
expire.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that the legislative caucuses of all political
parties and factions will place the top priority on screening all
those reform bills in order to wipe out money- and organized
crime-linked politics, curb official corruption, purify campaign
activities and maintain good order in the legislature," Lai urged.</P>
      <P>The package of the parliamentary reform bills include revisions
to certain existing statutes, such as the Public Officials Election
and Recall Law and the Legislators Behavior Law and the Legislative
Power Enforcement Law, as well as legislation of new laws, including
regulations to govern political contributions, political parties,
parliamentary lobbying, and neutrality of civil servants.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian gave up his
motorcade Friday and instead rode a bicycle to the Presidential
Office to demonstrate his concern for the environment in the run-up
to Earth Day, which falls on Sunday this year.</P>
      <P>Although it began to rain early in the morning, the waiting media
learned that the president's scheduled bicycle ride to work would
still take place.</P>
      <P>At 8:20 a.m., just minutes after the downpour started to peter
out, the president, accompanied by Hau Lung-pin, director general of
the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA); Ho Cheng-tan, the
vice minister of Transportation and Communications; and Chen's
security staff, pedaled out of the presidential residence on
schedule, all donning safety helmets.</P>
      <P>Although it was only a five-minute ride from the residence to the
Presidential Office, traffic had to be temporarily controlled to
ensure the safety of the president. The vehicles jam-packed on both
sides of the boulevard formed a striking contrast to the group of
cyclists commuting to the office.</P>
      <P>Chen said that it is good to cycle to the office and that he
hopes a similar activity can be held every month. He added that he
would ride his bicycle back to his residence in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>The EPA director said that in consideration of Earth Day, the
president took the initiative in suggesting the bicycle commute as a
way of promoting energy conservation and pollution reduction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR: INTER-CITY EXCHANGES NO SUBSTITUTE FOR DIPLOMATIC TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 20 (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that
the city's exchanges with other cities in foreign countries, no
matter how successful, still provide no substitute for the Republic
of China's diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Receiving 38 diplomats-to-be from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
at his office, Ma acknowledged that the so-called city-to-city
diplomacy may help the nation's diplomatic situation on a technical
level by winning good-will from people in other countries. However,
he said he would not expect the use of such exchanges to mend
diplomatic fences, as some people would suggest.</P>
      <P>He said Taipei's exchanges with cities in foreign countries are
not primarily aimed at helping improve the nation's diplomatic
situation, but are instead aimed at sharing experiences in city
planning and development in order for mutual progress in these areas.</P>
      <P>The mayor promised that he will work closely with the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs when visiting any city in a foreign country in the
future.</P>
      <P>On the home front, he said the city government of Taipei will
work to improve its contact with the some 53,000 foreign nationals
living in the city.</P>
      <P>Ma disclosed that to strengthen interactions with foreign
nationals in Taipei, the city government has enlisted volunteer
workers to offer needed services. The city has also sponsored various
activities for the 30,000 foreign workers in the city and has
provided them with legal protection and humanitarian treatment.</P>
      <P>The mayor said that in doing so, the foreign nationals will carry
many good memories about Taiwan with them when they return to their
own countries one day. "This will be the best city-to-city
diplomacy," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN DECIDES TO GRANT LEE VISA SOON WITH CONDITIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japanese authorities have decided to grant
former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui a visa for a visit to
Japan to receive medical treatment, sources from the Japanese Cabinet
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said he reached consensus
with Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori that the Japanese government would
grant Lee an entry visa under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>Kono told reporters that the consensus he reached with Mori and
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda is that a decision on the Lee
visa issue will be made "as soon as possible."</P>
      <P>Kono, who had previously opposed issuing the visa because of
concerns that it would anger Beijing, acquiesced to repeated demands
by Mori that Lee be granted a visa on humanitarian grounds. He
confirmed Friday that Tokyo will issue a visa for Lee with conditions
attached.</P>
      <P>The visa will be issued soon, as long as Lee agrees to confine
his stay in Japan to fulfilling the purpose of receiving medical
treatment in a hospital in Kurashiki City of the western prefecture
of Okayama and to conduct no political activities, Kono noted.</P>
      <P>If everything goes smoothly, the visa could be issued as early as
Friday, according to Kono.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on reports from Taipei that former ROC President Lee
Teng-hui would choose not to visit Japan if conditions were attached,
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda denied that the Japanese
government has asked Lee to sign a written pledge promising that he
will confine his visit to Japan to only Kurashiki, Okayama in
exchange for granting visa.</P>
      <P>Fukuda said the Japanese government has asked Lee to restrict his
Japanese visit to medical activities in Kurashiki, Okayama, but has
not demanded a signature on a written pledge.</P>
      <P>Lee filed an application with the Taipei office of the
quasi-official Japan Interchange Association April 10 for a visa to
visit Japan before April 24 to have his heart examined and treated by
the same Japanese doctor who supervised his heart surgery at National
Taiwan University Hospital last Oct. 8.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REMAINS OF `BLACK BAT' SQUADRON CREW TO BE TAKEN BACK TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker
urged the Republic of China military Friday to assist in taking back
the remains of the 14 crew members of an ROC surveillance plane
downed by mainland China in 1963.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Shei-saint made the call at a press conference
held at the Legislative Yuan. Also present were Lu Teh-chi, a former
head of the military's 34th squadron, also known as the "Black Bat
Squadron," and the bereaved families of the crew of the downed spy
plane.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ill-fated plane, flown by pilot Chou I-li, entered
mainland Chinese air space on a nighttime surveillance mission June
19, 1963.</P>
      <P>"Eight mainland Chinese MiG fighters scrambled to chase and
intercept our spy plane, which was later brought down over Linchuan
in the central mainland province of Jiangxi," Chen said, adding that
Chou and 13 other crew members all died in the incident.</P>
      <P>Their remains have since been buried in a graveyard on the
outskirts of Linchuan, Chen said, adding that Chou's widow, Hsiao
Chia-chen and the families of several other crewmen are scheduled to
travel to Linchuan between late April and early May to take back the
remains of their loved ones.</P>
      <P>"About 40 years have passed since the `Black Bat Squadron' crew
sacrificed their lives for our country. Now their remains will
finally be taken home. The government, the military and even ordinary
citizens should show more concern about the event and organize
activities to welcome home the remains and souls of our national
heroes," Chen urged.</P>
      <P>For her part, Hsiao said that when her husband was downed in
mainland China 38 years ago, their four children were all very young.
"And now they have all grown up. My greatest hope over the years has
been to take back my husband's remains. By so doing, I hope my
husband's soul can finally find solace," an emotional Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, the former head of the "Black Bat
Squadron," Lu Teh-chi, said the squadron conducted more than 800
spying flights over mainland China between 1953 and 1967. "Among
them, 15 ROC planes were shot down, resulting in the deaths and
injuries of 148 crew members," Lu said, adding that taking back the
remains of killed crew for reburial can offer great comfort to their
families.</P>
      <P>In response, a military official present at the news conference
said the Ministry of National Defense (MND) and other relevant
government agencies will do their utmost to assist the families in
taking back the remains of the crew.</P>
      <P>"Although the MND cannot send any servicemen to accompany the
bereaved families on their mainland trip, it will direct the Air
Force General Headquarters to help arrange for the reburial of the
crew once they are taken home," the MND official said.</P>
      <P>Under current ROC law, no military officers in active service can
travel to mainland China.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) had
not heard from the Japanese authorities as of Friday noon about a
decision on whether it will issue an entry visa for former President
Lee Teng-hui, according to MOFA spokeswoman Katherine Chang.</P>
      <P>Chang declined to comment on news reports that the Japanese
government had agreed to issue a visa for Lee only if he promises to
confine his Japanese visit to receiving medical treatment at a
hospital in the western city of Kurashiki and to conduct no political
activities. She said only that MOFA will extend Lee every possible
help if he is granted a visa.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, responding at the Legislative Yuan to
Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Chou Ya-shu, who questioned
Chang's "ignorance" of the visa issue, said the Cabinet respects
Lee's will and choice in regard to the issue, a thorny one for Japan
and now for Lee too.</P>
      <P>Lee and his office at the Taiwan Research Institute (TRI) were
not available for comment on whether he would agree to Japan's
conditions.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, local newspapers had reported that Lee was
enraged by the conditions and said that he would rather not visit
Japan if the visa were issued with conditions attached.</P>
      <P>As of Friday noon, Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono had said
the visa could be issued soon, as long as Lee agrees to confine his
stay in Japan to receiving medical treatment in Kurashiki.</P>
      <P>It could not be confirmed whether Lee had been asked to sign a
written pledge promising that he would confine his Japanese visit to

      <P>The U.S. State Department issued a
public announcement Thursday cautioning Americans, particularly those
of Chinese origin, to carefully evaluate the possible risk of being
detained by Communist Chinese authorities before deciding to travel
to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The announcement pointed out that individuals who have at any
time engaged in activities or published writings critical of
Beijing's policies or who have traveled to Taiwan or been involved
with Taiwan media organizations are particularly at risk of
detention, even if they have previously visited mainland China
without incident.</P>
      <P>The State Department made the announcement in response to recent
cases in which the Communist Chinese Ministry of State Security has,
without offering any evidence to substantiate their allegations,
taken American citizens or U.S. permanent residents of Chinese origin
into custody on suspicion of espionage or engaging in activities
damaging to Communist China's national security.</P>
      <P>U.S. citizens planning to visit or live in mainland China are
advised to consult the State Department's Consular Information Sheet

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An American conservative organization
Thursday urged U.S. President George W. Bush to authorize the sale
of Aegis-equipped destroyers to Taiwan promptly to help deter a
potential Communist Chinese military attack against the island.</P>
      <P>"The best way to avoid direct U.S. involvement in a cross-strait
military conflict is to reinforce Taiwan's capability for
self-defense," said Howard Phillips, president of the Conservative
Caucus Foundation, in a full-page advertisement addressed to the U.S.
president in the Thursday edition of the Washington Times.</P>
      <P>The Virginia-based organization told Bush that "you need to read
this report to focus on the facts about Red China which Clinton
holdovers in your administration might prefer you ignore."</P>
      <P>The Conservative Caucus Foundation report, titled "The Forward
Defense of America's Vital National Security Interests: Addressing
the Increase of Communist China's War Fighting Capabilities," pointed
out that Taiwan is being increasingly isolated and that Communist
China's campaign of military intimidation could lead to the
capitulation of a Taiwan denied the purchase of U.S. defense
equipment.</P>
      <P>The report also noted that mainland China is systematically
building its infrastructure and influence in the Western Hemisphere
and that the Beijing-Moscow military alliance poses new threats to
the United States and its interests.</P>
      <P>The organization called on President Bush to consider
withdrawing Communist China's most-favored-nation trade status, which
last year gave the Beijing regime a US$84 billion trade surplus and
helped subsidize its military buildup.</P>
      <P>President Bush was also urged to oppose Communist China's bid to
host the 2008 Olympic games and press the government of Panama to
cancel the "corruptly concluded contract, which gave a Beijing-linked
corporation control of the container ports on both the Atlantic and
Pacific sides of the Panama Canal."</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT TO STIMULATE ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Lai In-jaw stressed Friday
that the government will seek to expand public expenditure and
improve the domestic investment environment to help promote domestic
investment growth and economic rebound.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks at a meeting of the Chinese National
Association of Industry &amp; Commerce.</P>
      <P>He said that as an export-oriented country, Taiwan has seen its
economic growth impacted by the sluggish global economy, adding that
economic growth in the United States, which was 5.1 percent last
year, is predicted to drop to 1.2 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Researchers have predicted that Taiwan's economic growth this
year will also drop to around 5 percent from the 5.98 percent of last
year.</P>
      <P>Lai said that the government will do its utmost to tide the
country over the difficulties, including working out substantial
measures such as stepping-up promotion of the tourism industry, to
stimulate the economy.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the government has unveiled a NT$810 billion
(US$24.62 billion) project to promote investment, hoping to lay a
solid foundation for domestic infrastructure construction. In
addition, he went on, the government will also attach special
importance to transportation, and water and electricity supplies by
keeping track of related issues every week.</P>
      <P>He said the government has set up one-stop service counters in
various industrial zones so as to lure private investment. The
government is also completing the enactment of several financial
laws.</P>
      <P>Lai's remarks were made in the wake of a downward revision of
this year's economic growth rate to 4.57 percent by the Chung-Hua
Institute for Economic Research, a domestic research institute.</P>
      <P>The institute said that the effect of the strained economy seems
to be far-reaching and extensive, adding that economic growth rate in
the first quarter will be only 3.69 percent, followed by 4.14 percent
and 4.33 percent, respectively, in the second and third quarters,
with a more obvious rebound of 6.06 percent in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>It continued that private consumer growth will be just 3.5
percent this year -- the lowest figure on record since 1960 --
showing that domestic confidence has yet to recover and that its
impact on the economy will be great.</P>
      <P>Domestic investment growth will be 1.69 percent, also
representing rather sluggish growth. In foreign trade, commodities
and service growth will be only 1.54 percent, while imports will
decline by 0.83 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Chung-Hua said that as the economy continues to be sluggish,
consumer price growth will drop to 0.99 percent this year and the
exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar to the U.S. dollar will be
hover at around 32.88.</P>
      <P>It also predicted that economic growth next year will be 5.77
percent.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Friday that U.S. sales of defensive weapons are critical to the
safeguarding of Taiwan's democratic way of life.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with two members of the U.S.
House of Representatives, Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.) and Bob Schaffer
(R-Colo.), who are currently on their first visits to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC needs advanced weaponry systems to defend its
national security in the face of mainland China's intensified
military buildup, Chen said the United States should sell Taiwan
necessary defensive arms to help protect the island's democratic
political system and lifestyle.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that the ROC supports U.S. efforts to improve
its relationship with mainland China. "Nevertheless, we are hopeful
that the United States will pay heed to the voice of our people and
respect their free will and choice while it conducts constructive
engagements with the mainland," he added.</P>
      <P>The president told his guests that he was very glad to meet them
as they have long been staunch supporters of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chen said the people of Taiwan are grateful for the two American
congressmen's consistent, firm support for the ROC's national cause,
such as backing the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, Taiwan's bid to
join the World Health Organization as an observer, sales of advanced
destroyers equipped with the Aegis battle management radar system and
other cutting-edge military hardware.</P>
      <P>Chen, who assumed office in Taiwan's first-ever democratic
transfer of power between different political parties last May, said
his administration is determined to uphold such universal values as
democracy, freedom and human rights.</P>
      <P>"Promoting human rights is one of our major policy goals," Chen
told the American lawmakers, adding that Taiwan hopes to join forces
with the international community in promoting human rights.</P>
      <P>For their parts, Bartlett and Schaffer said that although they
had never visited Taiwan before, they have never wavered in their
support for the ROC. And their current visit has made them become
even firmer in their backing of Taiwan's cause, they added.</P>
      <P>Bartlett, a fifth-term House member, recalled that he voiced
strong opposition when the U.S. government decided to switch its
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>"It was the wrong decision," Bartlett said, adding that it
violated the democratic spirit of the U.S. constitution and the
self-determination principle outlined in the U.S. Declaration of
Independence.</P>
      <P>Both Bartlett and Schaffer assured Chen that they will continue
their support for U.S. arms sales to Taiwan to help safeguard peace
and security in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>Ambassadors and representatives of six
Central American countries to the Republic of China paid a call on
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou Friday to complain of difficulties in
finding parking spaces for their cars in the city.</P>
      <P>They also urged the city to cease the practice of towing

      <P>Ma expressed regret for cases in which diplomats have had their
cars towed and, unable to understand the chalk scrawls left by the
tow truck companies advising owners as to where they can retrieve
their vehicles, have had to suffer much inconvenience and time
getting back their cars.</P>
      <P>He said the city government will "try its best" to solve the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A team of Republic of China researchers
will join forces with counterparts in Japan, Germany, mainland China
and South Korea in an effort to sequence the chimpanzee genome, a
team spokesman announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The ROC team is composed of research fellows from National Yang
Ming University, Veterans General Hospital and the National Health
Research Institute, said Yang Ming University Professor Tsai
Shih-feng.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Taiwan will invest NT$150 million (US$4.57 million) in
the ambitious international research program, which may need an
estimated US$100 million to complete.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the ROC team will focus on the sequencing of
the 30 million nucleotides in the chimpanzee's No. 3 chromosome.</P>
      <P>"With our previous experience in sequencing the 10 million
nucleotides in the human No. 4 chromosome, we believe the new
chimpanzee research program will be conducive to our genetic research
concerning certain diseases, including liver cancer, hepatitis B,
AIDS and Alzheimer's disease," Tsai explained.</P>
      <P>Noting that chimpanzees have 24 pairs of chromosomes, one pair
more than humans, Tsai said the number of genomes is not necessarily
related to the complexity of the cells from which they come.</P>
      <P>In the history of evolution, according to Tsai, the chimpanzee is
the animal most akin to humans.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the new chimpanzee genome sequencing program can
help us understand what makes human beings," Tsai explained, adding
that the project is also expected to help answer basic questions
about evolution.</P>
      <P>Tsai said researchers in Japan and Germany have already begun
sequencing the chimpanzee No. 21 chromosome and will later continue
their research into the No. 23 chromosome.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese and South Korean research teams will also play
important roles in the joint reach program, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He further said participation in the program will enable Taiwan
to establish cooperative ties with other genome research centers, to
exchange experience and to improve its ability and skill through
national collaboration.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China Armed
Forces conducted a live-fire anti-landing training exercise in
Taiwan's southernmost county of Pingtung Friday.</P>
      <P>The combined services drill was the climax of the Hankuang No. 17
Exercise that began last month and has seen the staging of "cyberwar
games" as well as air defense, anti-submarine and anti-ship drills.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,700 troops from various military branches took part
in the exercise, using a variety of anti-landing weaponry and
supported by air-defense and naval defense weapons, including
artillery, helicopters, jet fighters and warships.</P>
      <P>The scenario for Friday's drill -- the largest military training
exercise of the year -- had mainland Chinese forces passing the
central line of the Taiwan Strait and moving toward the Taiwan coast.</P>
      <P>F-5E fighters and naval missile boats were deployed against the
invaders. Rockets, tanks and helicopters were all used in the

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL HOG-RAISING EXPECTED TO BECOME MORE DIFFICULT AFTER WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Agricultural officials said Friday that
the cost of raising hogs in Taiwan is too high and that the industry
will face even more difficulty when Taiwan enters the World Trade
Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has predicted that in the first
year of Taiwan's WTO membership, the cost of raising hogs will have
to be cut to less than NT$46 per kilo and down even further to below
NT$41 in the sixth year, if it is to be competitive.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County government officials said that the scale of hog
raising in Taiwan is not large or economically efficient, with costs
of private hog raisers averaging between NT$40 and NT$42 per kilo,
slightly higher than the auction price. However, even though hog
farmers are usually one-man operations without extra personnel
expense, they can barely make a living.</P>
      <P>State-owned Taiwan Sugar Co., which is the largest hog raiser in
Taiwan, has even higher costs, with an average cost of raising a hog
calculated at NT$46.49 per kilo last year, with a target of below
NT$45 per kilo this year.</P>
      <P>The officials blamed Taisugar's high costs on the "bureaucratic
mentality" of the Taisugar staff, which they said leads to a high
fatality rate among its hogs and piglets.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that Taisugar's death rates among hogs and
piglets last year were 4.32 percent and 5.51 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Since Chinese New Year, which fell on Jan. 24, the supply of hogs
has outnumbered demand and the auction price of hogs in the market
has averaged around NT$40 per kilo, leaving private hog farmers
barely able to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>In addition, the foot-and-mount disease (FMD) epidemic that hit
Taiwan in 1997 was a devastating blow to Taiwan's hog industry,
resulting in a ban on pork exports. Although the island's hog
population was cut dramatically after the FMD outbreak, Taiwan still
maintains about 10 million hogs, 2 million of which are located in
Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTRY SEEKS CORRECTION FROM U.S. NEWSPAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San   Francisco,   April   19   (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's
representative office here announced Thursday that it has demanded
that a local daily correct a report that claimed the ROC foreign
minister said Taiwan "could accept" a Washington decision to reject
its request to buy Aegis-equipped destroyers.</P>
      <P>The April 14 San Jose Mercury News front-page report quoted ROC
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao as saying that "maintaining
very friendly relations with the United States government is very
important" to Taiwan, and that "damaging that relationship over one
weapon system is not sensible."</P>
      <P>However, a spokesman for the ROC representative office said that
Tien had in fact pointed out that ROC-U.S. relations are
multi-faceted, and that the Aegis system, as simply one item on the
island's military procurement list, should not be seen as an
indicator of bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The spokesman claimed that there were other discrepancies between
the reported content and what Tien actually said, and that other
quotes were taken out of context.</P>
      <P>The spokesman added that Tien had originally arranged for a
"background briefing," not a formal interview meant for publication,
with the Mercury News Tokyo Bureau reporter who wrote the story.</P>
      <P>The story came at a sensitive time in Taipei-Washington-Beijing
relations, with the Bush administration slated to decide on Taiwan's
arms shopping list next week amidst the usual protests from Beijing.</P>
      <P>The report claimed that Tien's remarks are likely to relieve some
of the pressure on the United States to sell the cutting-edge Aegis
destroyers, which Taiwan has been seeking to purchase for several
years to offset the threat of missiles deployed by mainland China
opposite the island.</P>
      <P>Some analysts in both Taipei and Washington have even taken the
remarks attributed to Tien as a sign that Taiwan's determined stance
to acquire the destroyers -- evident in the ever more vocal remarks
by senior government officials in the days leading to the arms sales
talks -- has softened considerably.</P>
      <P>According to the ROC representative office, the San Jose Mercury
News received the letter of complaint and forwarded it to the daily's
parent company, Knight Ridder, which publishes 32 dailies in the
United States and is responsible for the Tokyo bureau.</P>
      <P>However, according the Mercury News, the editor in charge of
international news at Washington-based Knight Ridder is currently on
sick leave and unable to answer questions regarding the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS LEADER CALLS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF INVESTMENT CLIMATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mindful of Taiwan's future economic
development, a prominent business leader urged the government Friday
to focus on improving the domestic investment climate in order to
keep the business sector rooted in the country.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey L.S. Koo, chairman of the Chinese National Association of
Industry and Commerce (CNAIC), made the remark while delivering a
speech to a general assembly of the association, one of Taiwan's
three major business organizations. The meeting was held at the
Ambassador Hotel in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>In a speech titled "Improving the Investment Climate in Order to
Lay a Solid Foundation for Economic Development," Koo said that
sustainable economic development is vital to Taiwan's presence in the
international community, but it also hinges on a stable political
situation.</P>
      <P>Especially after Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO), expected by the end of this year, a stable political situation
will be more important for the island country's economic development,
Koo told CNAIC members present at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Koo said he is deeply confident that most local enterprises are
willing to stay rooted in Taiwan, as it is their homeland. However,
he stressed, the business sector hopes that the government will speed
up its improvements of the investment environment and seek to
maintain political stability because "roots kept in Taiwan must be
nourished by fertile soil."</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has enjoyed stable economic growth in recent
years, the pace of growth has slowed considerably, Koo noted, adding
that the economic slowdown can be mainly attributed to the continued
deterioration of the domestic investment climate.</P>
      <P>He said this includes a deterioration of social security, hikes
in wages, a shortage of skilled manpower, fears caused by
insufficient water and power supplies, tougher regulations on
environmental protection, low administrative efficiency, imperfect
preferential taxation measures and difficulties in obtaining land for
business and industrial use.</P>
      <P>Despite a slower U.S. economy last year, Taiwan's economy posted
a 6-percent gain, he noted. But he stressed that last year's growth
had lost its momentum, dropping sharply from 7.9 percent during the
first quarter of 2000 to 4.1 percent during the fourth.</P>
      <P>Most worrisome is that real investment by the private sector,
influenced by the slowing export expansion and the sluggish economy,
is expected to drop to 4.4 percent this year, far behind the 13.7
percent recorded in 2000, he said.</P>
      <P>Slumping private sector investment will put pressure on overall
domestic demand, making it more difficult for Taiwan's economy to
bounce back, Koo said.</P>
      <P>Consequently, he called on the government to accelerate the
implementation of all relevant policies on expanding public
investment and to improve the domestic investment climate efficiently
so as to facilitate manufacturers' business operations in the
country.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government should also redouble its efforts to
boost the development of the service industry, transform Taiwan into
a pivotal global center for high technology development, build the
island into a research and development center for traditional
industries, and make the island into a global logistics and
management center, the CNAIC head added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NTU PRESIDENT WARNS OF DIVERSIFIED CRISES IN HIGHER EDUCATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) President
Chen Wei-jao warned Friday that Taiwan's higher education system is
facing multiple crises that have resulted in declining
competitiveness for the country.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that the four major crises facing Taiwan's higher
education are insufficient international competitiveness, a lax
learning attitude on the part of students, negative effects caused by
the influence of commercialization and dwindling respect for the
sector from society.</P>
      <P>Citing national competitiveness ratings compiled by the
Lausanne-based International Institute for Management and
Development, Chen said Taiwan was ranked 22nd in 2000, a fall of our
notches from 1999 and behind Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. The
ranking of Taiwan's performance in any single technology also dropped
from seventh place in 1998 to 12th last year, he noted.</P>
      <P>In terms of national R&amp;D budgets, Chen said Taiwan took 19th
place, while the island's budget for basic research was far lower
than that of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the competitiveness of the higher education
system serves as a index to gauge a country's competitiveness in this
current knowledge-based era, Chen warned that an increasing imbalance
in quality and quantity in the development of domestic universities
in recent years has led to the declining national competitiveness.
Taiwan's universities are gradually sinking into mediocrity, he said.</P>
      <P>Deliberating on the so-called imbalance in quality and quantity
with regard to Taiwan's higher education system, Chen noted that
government spending allocated for each student at state-run
universities has slid by 20 percent over the past decade, as the
number of universities in Taiwan has grown from just 50 in 1991 to
nearly 150 now.</P>
      <P>Currently, average government subsidies for public university
students are markedly lower than in neighboring Japan, Hong Kong and
South Korea, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the NTU president said that the average academic
level of Taiwan university students is relatively low, as many of
them just want to "fool around" during their four-year university
career.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Taiwan's neighboring countries have actively geared
up their development of world-class universities, he noted, pointing
to mainland China and South Korea as examples.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, mainland China has selected nine of its
roughly 100 universities on which it is focusing its efforts to catch
up with the world's top academic standards, including Peking
University, Tsinghua University, Shanghai Jiaotong University,
Zhejiang University and the Harbin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>At the same time, South Korea has also worked out its "Brain
Korea 21" package as a measure to upgrade the academic levels of its
universities, he said.</P>
      <P>In the face of strong competition from these countries, Chen said
the Ministry of Education has been promoting a five-year "academic
excellence plan" since last year. Beginning next year, certain
selected domestic universities will be able to enjoy a special
government budget totaling NT$10 billion each year to support their
cooperation in joint academic research.</P>
      <P>In order to maintain academic independence and an environment
free from outside political or ideological interference, Chen
emphasized that high-level academic freedom must be fully respected,
as the objective of advocating higher education is not simply to
serve businesses.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that relevant authorities take effective
measures quickly to improve the English ability of local university
students and that university authorities upgrade the threshold for
academic performance and graduation requirements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUDDEN PROSECUTOR PERSONNEL SHUFFLE DRAWS CRITICISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Justice Minister Hsieh Wen-ting said
Friday that the large-scale reassignment of 21 chief prosecutors
announced the previous evening was meant to invigorate the personnel
system and create a "new prosecutorial culture."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said at a press conference to explain the sudden shuffle --
the second since last June -- that the decision was made out of
"holistic and functional considerations."</P>
      <P>He added that the shuffle is also expected to result in improved
bilateral communications between chief prosecutors and prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Regarding the reassignment of some chief prosecutors to actual
case-handling prosecutor positions at higher-level offices, Hsieh
said that they will be reassigned back to decision-making positions
in the future as opportunities present themselves, "allowing the
prosecution personnel system to be more alive, like a pond of moving
water."</P>
      <P>Hsieh denied reports that the reassignments were made in part due
to Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan's alleged disapproval over how some
chief prosecutors have handled several recent high-profile cases,
including a controversial raid on a college dorm to seize computers
with downloaded MP3 files, which prosecutors considered illegal.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the reassignment decision was not made based any
"single case" but rather on the chief prosecutors' overall abilities.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the reassignments were detrimental to morale, a
prosecutor at the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office criticized the
decision as "improper and unnecessary with no sense of urgency (for
the reassignments) evident at all."</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Liu Cheng-wu also announced his withdrawal from a
special task force established last year to fight "black gold," or
illegal government financial ties to organized crime. He added that
he will call on other prosecutors in anti-black gold task force
groups across the island to quit their teams en masse.</P>
      <P>He urged the Ministry of Justice to retract the reassignment
order, saying that most of the chief prosecutors on the list --
including the chief prosecutor of Taipei District Prosecutor's Office
-- are "chiefs who truly support independent prosecutor case
handling."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, four prosecutors at the Tainan District Prosecutor's
Office also announced their withdrawal from the local anti-black gold
task force in protest of what they called a "morale-shattering move."</P>
      <P>Lin Chao-yang, chief prosecutor at the Tainan District
Prosecutor's Office, said that he believes the decision to reassign
the 21 chief prosecutors -- including himself -- should be considered
"routine."</P>
      <P>Lin urged the public to give prosecutors more encouragement and
less criticism, adding that he will urge the four prosecutors still
under his command not to be so insistent about quitting their teams.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE MECHANISM URGED TO AVOID POSSIBLE CLASHES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
resume consultations and establish a channel for talks to avoid
possible clashes in the wake of the mid-air collision between a U.S.
surveillance plane and a mainland fighter April 1, which has fueled
nationalism in mainland China, experts and scholars said Friday.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks during a consultative committee meeting of
the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which first
listened to the MAC's Department of Legal Affairs on the effects that
mainland Vice Premier Qian Qichen's recent visit to the United States
might have on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>They noted that though there are multiple channels for
communications between Beijing and Washington, a cross-strait
communication mechanism has yet to be established.</P>
      <P>They said that therefore, the two sides should resume their
stalled talks and establish a dialogue mechanism to avoid possible
conflicts across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The MAC report said the main purpose of Qian's U.S. visit was to
conduct talks on policy and improve relations, adding that Qian had
maintained a low-key manner.</P>
      <P>But it pointed out that mainland China's assistance to Iraq in
laying fiber optic cable, the U.S. criticism of Beijing's human
rights abuse, the defection to the United States of China's Senior
Colonel Xu Junping, and the recent mid-air collision have all
seriously eroded the mutual trust between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The report also said that the stability of relations between
Beijing and Washington depends on several factors, including the
handling of the mid-air collision incident, U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan, the International Olympic Committee's vote on whether to
grant Beijing the right to host the 2008 Olympic Games, President
Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia and U.S. President George W. Bush's
planned visit to the mainland later this year.</P>
      <P>The report concluded that as cross-strait relations are closely
related to Beijing-Washington relations, Taiwan must monitor the
twists and turns of Beijing-Washington relations and work out
contingency plans to handle possible developments.</P>
      <P>Consultative committee members also said that the current state
of Beijing-Washington-Taipei ties will not remain unchanged
permanently, and Taiwan should map out short-, medium- and long-term
mainland policy to deal with the U.S.-proposed "interim agreement"
and Beijing's cherished "one country, two systems" formula.</P>
      <P>In related developments, a legislator proposed that a military
delegation comprised of retired ROC generals visit the mainland to
ease cross-strait tensions and take the first step toward
establishing a "military mutual trust mechanism."</P>
      <P>Legislator Elmer Feng of the opposition New Party made the
proposal during a general interpellation session in the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Feng cited his own experience, saying that he had in the past
acted in his capacity as a private citizen to negotiate for the
government with Beijing, showing that private individuals can also
play crucial roles in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Feng suggested that Taiwan's military delegation go to the
mainland to engage in discussions with military scholars there,
adding that he would like to help bring about such a visit.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said that the government must still
push for the two sides to resume their officially-endorsed
communication channels, meaning Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation
and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, and
that this mechanism can be used in tandem with private exchanges.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has a desire to
share its developmental and economic experience with other countries
as feedback for the international community, Government Information
Office Deputy Director-General P. N. Chang said recently in Israel.</P>
      <P>According to a GIO press release, Chang made the remarks at a
seminar with representatives of major media organizations Thursday in
Tel Aviv with an aim to introduce the ROC's current progress.</P>
      <P>Stressing that continued pursuit of democracy, peace and
prosperity are the basic goals of the ROC's national development
policy, Chang said that Taiwan will link its hi-tech industries with
its national development plan in an effort to create a highly
developed, environmentally sound island for future generations.</P>
      <P>Chang hailed the achievements made so far by both Israel and the
ROC, saying that both nations are small in size, heavy in population
and lacking in natural resources.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the situation across the Taiwan Strait, Chang said
the ROC government attaches a great deal of importance to its
relations with mainland China and to overall peace in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>While expressing his hope that Beijing's leadership will jump
over current barriers and transform the mainland into a democratic
regional power, Chang said that Taiwan will continue to strive to

a greater contribution to the whole world.</P>
      <P>Chang is currently visiting Israel after arriving in the Israeli

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu Friday presented the national flag to an ROC charity delegation
scheduled to leave for India next Monday to engage in humanitarian
relief work for the victims of the devastating Jan. 26 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Lu, who had launched a donation campaign aimed at helping the
victims of a fatal temblor that jolted western India, said at the
ceremony that she regrets that she is unable to visit India with the
delegation because of political reasons.</P>
      <P>However, Lu asked the delegation members to keep her informed of
the situation in the quake-stricken areas in India. The vice
president said that if necessary, she will launch a second campaign
to assist the quake victims there.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are no boundaries in humanitarian relief, Lu
voiced the hope that the delegation will be able to accomplish its
mission satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>With an enthusiastic response from all levels of Taiwan's
society, a total of US$700,000 in cash and US$300,000 worth of relief
materials was raised during the humanitarian assistance campaign
launched in early February. The funds were then delivered to
quake-stricken areas in India.</P>
      <P>The ROC delegation members, comprising representatives of private
enterprises, will also visit the seat of the Tibetan
government-in-exile in the northern Indian city of Dharmsala to get a
better understanding of the needs of Tibetan children there.</P>
      <P>During his recent visit to Taiwan, exiled Tibetan spiritual
leader the Dalai Lama donated US$150,000 to help the victims of a
killer earthquake that rocked central Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999. Moved
by this act of compassion, Lu staged a fund-raising campaign to

    <HEADLINE>CLA MULLING EASING BURDEN OF EMPLOYERS OF FOREIGN WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  central Taiwan, April 20 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Council
of Labor Affairs (CLA) on Friday expressed the hope that the Labor
Standard Law will be amended to lower wages for foreign workers.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu made the expression at a seminar in Taichung on how to
improve Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Chen said she will coordinate with legislators to amend the Labor
Standard Law so that only domestic workers enjoy the protection of
the basic wage and wages for foreign workers are decreased.</P>
      <P>Chen said that wages of foreign workers in Singapore and Hong
Kong are lower than that of Taiwan. At present, only foreign workers
in Taiwan enjoy the protection of the basic wage, which now stands at
NT$15,840 (US$495).</P>
      <P>She said that before the current law is amended, the CLA will
adopt a policy in which foreign workers' accommodations and food will
be included in their basic wage, thus leading to an average decrease
of NT$3,000-4,000 in the monthly costs of employing them.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the CLA also plans to curtail unreasonable
brokerage fees that foreign labor brokerage companies charge foreign
workers, so that they will be able to keep more of their wages.</P>
      <P>However, Chen Shen-hsien, director of the CLA's Labor Conditions
Department, said the CLA will not take the initiative of filing an
amendment to the Labor Standard Law. Instead, the CLA may ease the
burden of employers of foreign workers in other ways, such as

      <P>Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono
announced Friday that Japan will issue a visa to former Republic of
China President Lee Teng-hui to seek medical treatment for his heart

treatment at a hospital in nearby Kurashiki, and return to Taiwan
April 26, the Japanese official added.</P>
      <P>In response, the ROC Presidential Office announced that it
welcomed the decision, which it said will have "positive signifance"
on bilateral ROC-Japan relations.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice President Annette Lu also praised the Japanese
government for its "courage" in making the decision despite Beijing's
protests.</P>
      <P>ROC government spokesman Su Cheng-ping said that Taiwan is

    <HEADLINE>VISA ISSUE HURTS CROSS-STRAIT TRUST: EX-MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The controversy surrounding former
Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's application for a visa to
visit Japan has worsened cross-Taiwan Strait relations, a former
official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, a former chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China,
pointed out that Lee's Japan travel plan was originally a very simple
issue.</P>
      <P>"However, it has been complicated by the involvement of the ROC
and mainland Chinese governments," Su noted, adding that as a result,
the Japanese government's 11th-hour decision to grant Lee a visa will
have an adverse impact on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait relations have long been in bad shape, and I think
that the visa issue will further worsen bilateral Taiwan-mainland
Chinese ties," Su warned.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Su said the issue will probably not prompt mainland
China to take military action to vent its anger at Lee's upcoming
Japan visit.</P>
      <P>"Nor will the issue deteriorate cross-strait ties to the level
seen in 1995 when Lee made a private visit to his alma mater, Cornell
University, in New York State," Su remarked.</P>
      <P>Following Lee's U.S. visit in June 1995, mainland China conducted
several rounds of live-fire military exercises on Taiwan's doorstep,
including lobbing missiles into waters near the island, between the
second half of 1995 and early 1996, to intimidate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lee is now a private citizen, Su said his Japan visit
is purely for personal reasons. "It is for his own health and has
nothing to do with the ROC's international profile," he explained,
adding that Japan's issue of a visa to Lee should not be interpreted
as a "breakthrough" in Taipei-Tokyo relations.</P>
      <P>Su also expressed his doubts about the wisdom of the ROC
government getting so deeply involved in the process of Lee's visa
application.</P>
      <P>"While Japanese officials were still debating whether to issue
Lee a visa, senior ROC and mainland Chinese officials all made public
comments intended to affect Japan's decision," Su said, adding that
in his view, such practices will only hinder the long-term
development of cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>As for the latest U.S. decision to grant Lee a visa for a second
visit to Cornell University in early May, Su said the move is not
expected to further worsen Washington-Beijing ties, which have been
at a low ebb since a midair collision between a U.S. surveillance
plane and a mainland jet fighter over the South China Sea early this
month.</P>
      <P>Su said he thinks that the collision incident will make mainland
China more cautious and prudent in handling its relations with the
United States.</P>
      <P>Su went on to point out that both the U.S. and Japanese
governments granted Lee visas mainly because he has retired and has
played no active role in any political activities over the past year.
Lee ended his 12-year stint as ROC president last May.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAJORITY SUPPORT CUT IN SCHOOL SUMMER VACATION: KMT POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21 (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most people in Taiwan support a Ministry
of Education proposal to cut the length of summer vacation for
primary and secondary schools, according to the results of an
opposition Kuomintang-commissioned survey released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The results show that 62 percent of those surveyed support the
proposal, although it comes as no surprise that most students are
against the idea.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,067 people, who were asked their
opinions on the cutting of vacation days to make up for days lost due
to the five-day workweek, also found that 26 percent of the
respondents are opposed to the idea. Among students, on the other
hand, 43 percent under the age of 15 oppose the change, while 40
percent agree with the proposal.</P>
      <P>Thirty percent of the respondents said the summer and winter
vacations are too long or "just about enough," while 41 percent of
those under 15 years of age think the vacations are too short.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 47 percent said they are not satisfied with the newly
implemented diversified enrollment program for college candidates and
the academic proficiency examination for high school entry, showing
that improvements and corrections should be made to the two policies.</P>
      <P>Over 50 percent gave credit to Education Minister Ovid Tzeng, who
assumed his post last May, but 26 percent believe that he could have
done a better job, according to the survey.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC URGED TO STEP UP INFORMATION WARFARE RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China should step up its
information warfare research and craft an effective battle management
system in the face of mainland China's mounting military threat, a
group of scholars said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The academics made the call at a seminar on the outlook of
relations across the Taiwan Strait, sponsored by the Taiwan Research
Institute (TRI), a local privately funded think tank.</P>
      <P>The scholars said that whether the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
move toward an arms race or peaceful co-existence will hinge on
mainland China's mindset.</P>
      <P>The participating scholars agreed unanimously that only when the
military option is no longer a priority resort for mainland China to
resolve cross-strait disputes can the two sides co-exist and prosper
peacefully.</P>
      <P>Liao Hung-hsiang, a TRI research fellow, said at the seminar that
the ROC's current combat preparations focus on the acquisition of
advanced weaponry systems and that the military has not yet developed
a comprehensive command-control-communications-information and
intelligence management system.</P>
      <P>"This failure marks a serious drawback in our combat
preparedness," Liao said, adding that in any future military
conflict, information warfare will play a very critical role.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Liao said, it is imperative that Taiwan
forge a battle management system in its military buildup plan.</P>
      <P>Another TRI fellow, Tsai Ming-yen, said Taiwan should not dance
to mainland China's tune in arms procurement simply in order to avoid
a cross-strait arms race.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing's ongoing military modernization plan is
aimed at making mainland China a regional superpower, Tsai said
Taiwan need not follow in mainland China's footsteps regarding arms
procurement. If it does, Tsai said, Taiwan will face a heavy
financial burden and may trigger a cross-strait arms race.</P>
      <P>In Tsai's view, Taiwan's current defense strategy should focus on
building up a strong deterrent force. "Taiwan should have a strong
combat capability to deter mainland China's provocation, and then the
two sides can gradually forge confidence-building measures," he
explained.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, opposition Kuomintang Legislator
Ting Shou-chung, also a military expert, said that even though Taiwan
has purchased a great deal of advanced military hardware, the skills
for operating those weaponry systems have not matured due to the high
turnover of military officers and enlisted men.</P>
      <P>Ting suggested that military units should request foreign arms
suppliers to transfer relevant technology and expertise when they
purchase foreign-made weapons or military equipment.</P>
      <P>With information warfare expected to play a key role in any
future war, Ting said military units should intensify research in
this regard.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP OFFICIAL URGES BEIJING TO GIVE UP MISSILE DEPLOYMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Eric C.Y. Tseng and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the Republic of China's
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said here Friday that a
mainland Chinese renouncement of missile deployments opposite Taiwan
would have positive effects on Taipei-Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>Tien Hsin, director of the DPP's International Affairs
Department, said after delivering a speech at St. John's University
that mainland China cannot continue to increase its military budget
and the number of missiles aimed at Taiwan while doing everything it
can to prevent the island from acquiring weapons for its own defense.</P>
      <P>In his speech titled "The DPP's Place in Cross-Strait Relations,"
Tien speculated that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are unlikely
to engage in military conflict in the next few years because mainland
China currently lacks the ability to guarantee a successful invasion
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that because the mainland considers economic development
to be a priority objective, is preparing to enter the World Trade
Organization, is seeking to host the 2008 Olympic Games and will
complete a leadership transfer next year, maintaining a temperate
cross-strait situation conforms to Beijing's interests.</P>
      <P>Tien said that many observers mistakenly believe the DPP is happy
to see friction and conflict between Beijing and Washington. He
explained that the Taiwan Strait is the most sensitive region in the
Asia Pacific, and that any conflict between Beijing and Washington
would undoubtedly involve Taiwan. Such a scenario would not be
beneficial to Taiwan, Beijing or Washington, he added.</P>
      <P>Many observers also suspected that the DPP would seek Taiwan
independence in a radical manner after taking power last May, Tien
continued, claiming that the events of the past year have
demonstrated that ROC President Chen Shui-bian's mainland China
policy "has not raised any further skepticism."</P>
      <P>Chen also clearly stated that Taiwan will not pursue independence
because the island is in fact "already a sovereign nation" complete
with people, land and a legal government, Tien added.</P>
      <P>Tien said that the DPP is willing to consider "sacrificing a
certain degree of sovereignty" in exchange for lasting peace in the
Taiwan Strait under "reasonable conditions." He said that precedents
exist such as the European Union, the British Commonwealth or other
forms of federation systems. These are all issues that can be
discussed in cross-strait political dialogue, he added.</P>
      <P>Tien criticized Beijing for insisting on its "one country, two
systems" proposal, which he said is in fact Beijing's attempt to have
Taiwan give up its sovereignty in exchange for "Beijing's so-called
peace."</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan will not accept this type of surrender.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FEMALE AIDS PATIENTS REPORTING RATE LOW: HEALTH OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A health official in charge of disease
control said Saturday that the low reporting rate of female AIDS
patients in Taiwan is a serious situation that should not be taken
lightly.</P>
      <P>Twu Shiing-jer, director-general of the Center for Disease
Control under the Department of Health, said that just 241 out of the
3,044 reported cases of HIV infection in Taiwan as of March 15 are
women, representing a female-to-male ratio that is much lower than
the world average.</P>
      <P>The first case of female AIDS infection in the world was not
discovered until 1982, after which the figure for female infection
has been rapidly on the rise, he said in a speech delivered at a
seminar to mark the 10th anniversary of the Republic of China Sex
Education Association.</P>
      <P>Twu noted that as of June 2000, 44 percent of the 33.6 million
AIDS patients in the world are women, despite the fact that the
disease was spread among male homosexuals in the early days of its
existence. Today, he went on, the disease is spread predominantly
through heterosexual behavior.</P>
      <P>Physiologically, women are more susceptible to HIV than men and
should therefore learn how to protect themselves from the threat of
AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, Twu said.</P>
      <P>He noted that HIV transmission exhibits two major patterns. The
first, a web-like pattern, is seen in regions such as Europe and
North America, where greater respect for women's rights has led to
approximately equal numbers of sexual partners for men and women. The
virus is more easily controlled because it spreads out in a
one-to-three, three-to-nine pattern, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Twu continued, in Asian and African regions where gender
inequality has resulted in greater acceptance for men to seek out
prostitutes while women are looked down on for having multiple sexual
partners, the second pattern of radically explosive infections
centers around sex industry workers and is marked by a very rapid
virus transmission rate that goes from one to 100, and then from 100
to 10,000.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Twu stressed, it is urgent and important to elevate
the level of women's rights in Asia to fight the spread of AIDS and
other sexually transmitted diseases.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Saturday at
an international seminar on laboratory medicine that biotechnology is
a major area of interest to the Republic of China government.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the government will join forces with

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should endeavor to forge dialogue
and cooperative ties with mainland China's moderate forces so that it
can become a "lubricant" between mainland China and other neighboring
Asian countries, a ruling party official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yen Chien-fa, director of the mainland China affairs department
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), made the pitch at a
seminar on the outlook for relations across the Taiwan Strait
sponsored by the Taiwan Research Institute, a privately funded think
tank.</P>
      <P>Yen said changing global economic trends have made Taiwan more
vulnerable in the face of mainland China's competition for investment
capital and technological expertise.</P>
      <P>"And mainland China's squeeze on Taiwan's economic resources is
expected to intensify after both sides are admitted to the World
Trade Organization in the not-too-distant future and the opening of
direct cross-strait trade, mail and transport links," Yen noted.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Yen said, Taiwan should carve out a niche
as a "lubricant or bridge" between mainland China and its Asian
neighbors instead of becoming the "detonator" of an "ammunition
dump."</P>
      <P>Yen went on to say that as Taiwan's new ruling party, the DPP has
held out olive branches to cultivate friendly ties with the mainland,
which has been hostile toward the DPP's previous pro-Taiwan
independence stance.</P>
      <P>"We are more than willing to hold peaceful dialogue and enter
constructive cooperative programs with mainland China," Yen stressed,
adding that by so doing, Taiwan will be in a better position to
protect its own interests and security.</P>
      <P>Yen further revealed that the DPP is working on various
forward-looking cooperative projects to help boost cross-strait
rapprochement. "We are hopeful that mainland China will drop its
recalcitrant one-China principle to facilitate the development of

    <HEADLINE>ROC GOVERNMENT KEEPS LOW PROFILE ON LEE'S JAPAN VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Presidential Office
kept a low profile Saturday on Japan's 11th-hour decision to grant
former ROC President Lee Teng-hui a visa on humanitarian grounds.</P>
      <P>"We welcome the favorable Japanese decision, but we have no
intention of politicizing the issue," said a Presidential Office
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official further said the ROC government did not regard the
Japanese move as a breakthrough in the already substantive relations
between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>After a week of heated debate, the Japanese government finally
agreed late Friday to issue Lee an entry visa so that he could travel
to Japan Sunday to receive treatment for a heart condition at a
hospital in Kurashiki, a city near Osaka.</P>
      <P>The decision immediately drew a strong protest from mainland
China, which threatened to recall its ambassador to Japan and suspend
exchanges of visits by their senior officials in protest.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the mainland reaction, the Presidential Office
official said mainland China need not adopt a hostile, "zero-sum"
approach in handling relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We don't regard the Japanese decision as a `victory' for Taiwan,
nor do we regard it as a `loss' for the mainland," the official
explained, adding: "We are hopeful that mainland China will not
over-react to the issue and will refrain from giving it too many
political ramifications."</P>
      <P>Quoting President Chen Shui-bian, the official said mainland
China should give Taiwan the "breathing room, even though it intends
to trap the island in a corner."</P>
      <P>The official further said that the Japanese government decided to
issue Lee a visa mainly on humanitarian grounds. "We believe its
decision meets the expectations of the ROC and Japanese general
public," the official said, adding that other countries around the
world would also recognize Japan's move, as humanitarianism is a
universal value of all democratic countries.</P>
      <P>Since Lee is now a private citizen, the official said, mainland
China should ease off on the issue. "We hope Beijing's leaders will
cope with the issue from humanitarian and human rights standpoints."</P>
      <P>The official also expressed his hope that Taiwan, mainland China
and Japan can work together to maintain peace, stability and
prosperity in East Asia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Frank Hsieh said Lee's visa application is just an isolated case and
is not expected to have a profound impact on triangular
Taipei-Tokyo-Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is also mayor of the southern port city of Kaohsiung,
said he hopes mainland China can draw inspiration from the issue and
embrace the prevailing world trend of respecting freedom and
humanitarianism.</P>
      <P>"We also hope that the issue will not affect cross-strait
interaction," Hsieh said, adding that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait should increase exchanges to forge peaceful ties on a goodwill
and reciprocal basis.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two U.S. House representatives
visiting Taiwan have urged President George W. Bush to approve the
sale of the Aegis system, missile defenses and submarines to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If we are to avoid escalated conflict with China, America must
take this opportunity to show Beijing and the world we are as
committed to the causes of maintaining peace and supporting democracy
as we are to increasing trade," wrote Rep. Bob Schaffer (R-Colo.) and
Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett (R-Md.) in a letter sent from Taipei Friday.</P>
      <P>After meeting Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian, Defense
Minister Wu Shih-wen and other leaders during their one-week visit,
they claimed that "Taiwan's legitimate need for U.S. destroyers
equipped with the Aegis radar and weapons system is urgent. In fact,
these naval-based defense systems top the Taiwanese wish list."</P>
      <P>"Contrary to your advisers, the U.S. Navy has recommended the
sale of Aegis to Taiwan and the Department of Defense has concluded
that the Taiwanese have the ability to operate and integrate the
complex system," said the congressmen.</P>
      <P>"The truth is," they added, "this sale is about more than
standing firm in the face of recent Chinese aggression. It is about
maintaining balance and security in the Far East. It is about
maintaining U.S. credibility with our Asian allies. It is about
honoring our promise under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act by which the
United States agreed to sell Taiwan the weapons needed to maintain an
adequate self-defense."</P>
      <P>They told Bush that perhaps the best reason to stand beside
Taiwan at this critical juncture and authorize the sale of the Aegis
system "is the fact it will strengthen the island's vibrant democracy
and free-market system. An independent Taiwan bolsters the cause of
freedom around the world and provides stability to countries such as
Indonesia struggling for their own systems of democracy."</P>

angry response from mainland China, Canada's national broadcaster
reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC) said mainland Vice-Foreign
Minister Wang Yi summoned the Japanese ambassador to Beijing and told
him that the visa "disrupted and sabotaged relations."</P>
      <P>The CBC noted that Lee, who retired a year ago, drew the wrath of
Beijing for his efforts to break Taiwan out of diplomatic isolation
during his time in office.</P>
      <P>It quoted Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono as saying that Lee
has agreed not to engage in any political activity while in Japan,
but he admitted that "Mr. Lee is a very influential person
politically -- I think we are about to enter a very difficult period
in our diplomatic relations with China."</P>
      <P>Mainland China's Xinhua news agency left little doubt about that,
the CBC pointed out. Xinhua said: "Lee, formerly a troublemaker in
China-U.S. relations, is now coming out in the open as a troublemaker
in China-Japan relations and a troublemaker for Asia-Pacific peace
and stability."</P>
      <P>Lee is expected to arrive in Osaka Sunday night, receive medical
treatment Tuesday and return to Taiwan Thursday, the CBC said.</P>

      <P>The streets of the Canadian city of Quebec
were quiet Friday as U.S. President George W. Bush arrived for the
Summit of the Americas Friday.</P>
      <P>Visiting Canada for the first time as U.S. president, Bush was
joining 33 other Western Hemisphere leaders to discuss what could be
the world's largest free trade zone.</P>
      <P>He first met with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and the
two leaders discussed various bilateral concerns.</P>
      <P>"Our goal in Quebec is to build a hemisphere of liberty," Bush
told a news conference at the White House before leaving for Canada.
"We must approach this goal in the spirit of civility, mutual respect
and appreciation for our shared values."</P>
      <P>Thousands of anti-free trade demonstrators marched the streets of
the old city peacefully soon after Bush's arrival and some 6,500
police and 1,200 troops were deployed to control protesting crowds,
some of whom were said to have gear such gas masks with them.</P>
      <P>Fears of violence like that seen at international summits in
Seattle and Windsor, Ontario, led officials to take unprecedented
security measures, most notably erecting four kilometers of

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's environmental misery index
dropped 1.93 points this year from last year's 77.98 points,
indicating that the living environment is getting better, according
to a survey report released Saturday by the Environmental Quality
Protection Foundation (EQPF).</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,081 adults living on Taiwan was
conducted by Gallup on behalf of the foundation in mid-April.
The randomly selected respondents were asked to answer 24 questions
about Taiwan's environmental problems, EQPF Secretary General Liu
Ming-lung said.</P>
      <P>The survey used the respondents' judgment on the seriousness of
these problems to calculate the misery index. The problems included
various kinds of air and water pollution from various sources; the
disposal of garbage and used plastic products, and such kinds of
public nuisance as noise and foul smell.</P>
      <P>Liu said the overall misery index reached 76.05 points this
year, slightly lower than a year ago. The indicators of all
environmental problems, except the problem of killing wildlife,
showed signs of improvement, he added.</P>
      <P>The survey also separately calculated the environmental misery
index of Taiwan's eight most populous areas: Taipei City, Kaohsiung
City, Keelung City, Hsinchu City, Taichung City, Chiayi City, Tainan
City, and Taipei County. Taipei County topped the list with 77.7
points this year, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The same survey found that 51.5 percent of the respondents were
in favor of holding a referendum at the end of this year to decide
whether the construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant
should be continued, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATOR WORRIED STATE-OWNED FIRMS MAY BE FINANCIAL `BLACK HOLE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chao-jung of the
opposition People First Party said Sunday that state-owned
enterprises have become the nation's financial "black hole."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks on the eve of a legislative review of the
budget of state-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>He described the budget presented by state-owned enterprises as
"shocking," adding that between the latter half of 1999 and November
2000, nine state-owned enterprises lost a total of NT$30.718 billion
(US$933.67 million).</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics show that the nine state-owned enterprises
each lost between NT$203 million and NT$12.693 billion during the
period. Among them, the Taiwan Railway Administration was the chief
culprit, losing NT$12.693 billion.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government should urgently tackle the budget
problem, adding that it would be better to submit a comprehensive
policy to solve the problem rather than simply making an
across-the-board 5 percent cut in the budget for state-owned
enterprises, as was recently suggested by another legislator.</P>
      <P>He cited the example of Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corp. as
an example, saying that the company's paid-in capital is only NT$500
million, but it loses between NT$2 million and NT$3 million a day and
stands to lose twice its paid-in capital in a year. This problem, he
went on, will not be solved by simply cutting a certain percentage of
its budget.</P>
      <P>He further said that while money-losing corporations are
problematic, those that show profit on paper also have an even bigger
hidden problem, citing Taiwan Sugar Corp., whose budget proposal
shows that it made a profit of NT$260 million, when in fact it
actually lost NT$8.2 billion.</P>
      <P>He said that Taisugar, often billed as the biggest landowner in
Taiwan, collected revenues of NT$1 billion from rentals and NT$7
billion from the disposal of its land and questioned how such an
operation could be described as profitable.</P>
      <P>Accountant Lin Ching-lung also brought up Taisugar's bloated
budget proposal, criticizing the presented budget as false and the
profits as bloated. The state-owned budget proposals also lack
professional evaluation, while their reinvestments have been losing
large sums of money, he said, adding that their public relations
budgets, research and material costs are too high and their internal
management is poor.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan joined in worldwide Earth Day
celebrations Sunday with a multitude of events and activities around
the island.</P>
      <P>The Environment Protection Bureau under the Taipei city
government held a rally in Taipei in conjunction with several other
government agencies and private groups to raise public awareness of
environmental issues and what citizens can do to protect the
environment.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the rally, Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said
environmental protection is not an alien concept to Chinese, rather
it is inherent in the Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>Ma cited several examples, pointing out that Chinese of the past
admonished against fishing with small-mesh nets and advocated logging
only in autumn, when trees have become dormant for the winter, adding
that these ideas mesh with the concept of environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Hau Lung-bin, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Administration, said Taiwan is facing serious contamination and the
easiest way for everybody to contribute to the protection of the
island is to conserve energy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Eco Conservation Alliance, a coalition of
environmental groups, encouraged people to use public transport for
an Car-Free Earth Day. One local diving club urged local divers to
help clean up beaches and coral reefs around the island, while the
Taiwan No-nuke Group organized an open forum in a Taipei park to
discuss the hazards of nuclear energy.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1970, Earth Day was launched internationally in 1990.
Some 5,000 groups in 184 countries around the world celebrated the
day this year by holding rallies, fairs, conferences and other events
to raise awareness of critical environmental issues.</P>

      <P>Amid extensive media coverage, people
of this Japanese city have welcomed former Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to receive a heart checkup here.</P>
      <P>Local tourist associations said they welcome Lee's visit to
Kurashiki because of the huge amount of publicity it has generated in

Lee chose to undergo medical treatment at a local hospital, which

liver and rehabilitation departments.</P>
      <P>Kirashiki, a popular tourist resort located about one-hour's

      <P>Lee's plan to undergo a medical checkup for heart condition at

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local scholars and political experts said
Sunday that there are no indications that Taiwan's political parties
will undergo reshuffles prior to the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>However, they added, reshuffles might take place after the
elections.</P>
      <P>They further claimed that if the political parties undergo
reshuffles, it will weaken the power of the opposition parties to
monitor the government.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Chih-chia (KMT-Taipei County) said that according
to an unofficial estimate, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) might obtain 80 seats in the legislative elections, with the
People First Party (PFP) taking 40 seats.</P>
      <P>He added his opinion that if the tiny New Party cannot get
sufficient votes, the domestic political map will be dominated by the
KMT and the DPP with a PFP minority.</P>
      <P>The pro-former ROC President Lee Teng-hui faction within the KMT
will continue to support incumbent Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng for a second term, he went on.</P>
      <P>Predicting that the KMT will win more legislative seats, Lin
added that the chance of a coalition government between the KMT and
DPP will be greater than the chance of a DPP-PFP partnership.</P>
      <P>He also said it is unlikely that the KMT and PFP will cooperate
in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Hung-chi (KMT-Taipei City) said that party
reshuffle is still at the talking stage and if it were to occur, it
would not be until after the elections.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that the current political instability is chiefly a
result of the Chen administration's lack of confidence and the fact
that the DPP-led government has always shirked its responsibility.</P>
      <P>He cited Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan as an example,
speculating that Chen's reshuffle of 21 chief prosecutors around the
island was the result of pressure from the Legislative Yuan and
adding that the Legislative Yuan should demand that Chen step down if
the rumor is true. The domestic political unrest has come about
because the DPP, as a minority, is trying to confront the majority
in the legislature..</P>
      <P>Former Taipei Mayor Huang Ta-chow pointed out that the opposition
monitors the ruling party which is a normal situation in a democratic
country. Huang further predicted that a party reshuffle would further
weaken the opposition's power to monitor.</P>
      <P>Professor Huang Teh-fu of National Chengchi University said that
whether or not a reshuffle of political parties will be carried out
will be decided by the election votes and not by the DPP.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan director Ang Lee of the
Oscar-winning film "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" returned to
Taiwan from the United States Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lee was warmly greeted by Chiang Chuan-ching, director of the
Motion Picture Affairs Department under the Government Information
Office (GIO) and throngs of media upon his arrival at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport.</P>
      <P>Lee brought with him the first Oscar ever won by a Taiwan film,
telling local reporters that he wanted to share his joy with the
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that "Crouching Tiger," which garnered four Oscars for
best foreign-language film, best art direction, best cinematography
and best original music, was the effort of many people and that he
was proud to see so many Chinese mounting the stage to get their
Oscars.</P>
      <P>But he also said that although the Oscar ceremony was held in
March, the campaign to win the golden statuette actually started much
earlier, adding that his Oscar campaign actually started last August,
when he began traveling to various places in the United States to
take part in Oscar-related activities.</P>
      <P>He described himself as an election candidate to explain the
film's Oscar bid, adding that winning the Oscar is a "love and hate"
experience.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he will shoot another film with Oscar potential, he
said he planned to shoot films "for himself and for his audience."</P>
      <P>As for his failure to win the Oscar for best director, Lee said
he had done his best, and did not care about anything else. He
received the best director award from the Directors' Guild of
America, which is usually won by the director who later goes on to
win the Oscar.</P>
      <P>Lee, whose film credits also include "The Wedding Banquet,"
"Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm," returned to his hometown
of Tainan shortly after his press conference, where he will celebrate
his mother's 76th birthday, visit his high school alma mater,
National Tainan First High School and speak to the students there.</P>
      <P>Lee will also donate to the school a check for NT$1 million given
by the GIO to encourage film workers who win internationally
prestigious awards.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, who also attended the same high school,
is scheduled Tuesday to present Lee with an award for winning the
Oscar.</P>
      <P>Lee will leave Taiwan for Hong Kong April 27 to attend a film
award ceremony in which "Crouching Tiger" has been nominated in 15
categories and is expected to be a big winner.</P>
      <P>From Hong Kong, he will proceed to mainland China before
returning to the United States to work on his new film "The Hulk," a

    <HEADLINE>CEPD  MULLING  EXCLUSION  OF FOREIGN LABORERS FROM WAGE PROTECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the nation's highest economic
planning agency said over the weekend that he is working on proposals
to take basic wage protection away from foreign laborers, a local
newspaper reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>China Times reported that Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Council
of Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said Saturday that under
his proposal, foreign laborers will no longer be protected by the
nation's basic wage, which currently stands at NT$15,840 (US$481.45)
per month.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that a recently unveiled NT$810-billion government
project to expand domestic demand will make it mandatory that
domestic employers hire local laborers where possible.</P>
      <P>Chen said that under the double strain of the changing
international economic situation and shortened working hours, the
domestic unemployment rate is high and might continue to rise.</P>
      <P>He predicted boldly that the room for upward adjustment of wages
for Taiwan low-technology workers will be limited, considering the
fact that the nation is entering an information-led economic era.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan workers now face steep competition from
developing countries and added that "even if they work hard, they
will not necessarily win."</P>
      <P>Chen was echoing an earlier proposal by Economic Affairs Minister
Lin Hsin-yi earlier, who also urged the scrapping of the basic wage.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the intention of the basic wage is to protect the
basic rights of laborers, but considering the fact of high living
cost in Taiwan, it is not unreasonable for local laborers to enjoy a
minimum basic wage.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, as the families of foreign laborers are
mostly overseas where living costs lower than in Taiwan, there is
"room for discussion" as to whether the foreign laborers should be
given equal treatment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL PHYSICIST AWARDED BY OCPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A physicist from Taiwan has been acclaimed
as the 2000 winner of the "Outstanding Young Research Award" by the
Overseas Chinese Physics Association (OCPA).</P>
      <P>Ma Chung-pei, 34, told CNA in a telephone interview that she felt
very happy to be awarded by the OCPA, which sponsors the event every
year to encourage young overseas Chinese talent in excellent
performance in physics.</P>
      <P>Ma, who earned a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and has been an assistant professor at the Pennsylvania
State University since 1996, is slated to receive the prize April 28
in Washington from the OCPA, which is composed of outstanding Chinese
physicists based overseas, such as Nobel laureates Yang Chen-ning and
Lee Cheng-tao.</P>
      <P>Ma has received various awards in the past, such as the Annie J.
Cannon Award in Astronomy in 1997, and the Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship
and Cottrell Scholars Award in 1999, in recognition of her remarkable
research work. She was also the winner of the Lindback Award for
Distinguished Teaching from among more than 1,000 teachers in
Pennsylvania in 1998.</P>
      <P>In addition to her advanced studies in physics, Ma is also an
aficionado of the violin and won first prize in a Taiwan provincial
violin competition at the age of 17.</P>
      <P>Despite her busy schedule in the United States, Ma usually
returns to Taiwan every three months to take part in a research
project conducted by Academia Sinica's Institute of Physics, the
results of which, Ma said, will be a major international
breakthrough.</P>
      <P>Born into a liberal family, Ma attributes her success to her
parents, saying that ever since she decided at the age of 12 to be a
physicist, both her parents fully respected her wishes.</P>
      <P>Ma's father, Ma Chi-shen, is a well-known journalist, while her
mother, Huang Chao-heng, is also a journalist who also had served as
a member of the Republic of China Control Yuan, the nation's
highest-level watchdog organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NOT TO BYPASS 'ONE CHINA' ISSUE: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has no intention
to bypass the "one China" issue and is willing to talk with Beijing
over the issue after an internal consensus is forged, said Tsai
Ing-wen, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, Sunday.</P>
      <P>Differences have always existed between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits over certain sensitive issues, sending cross-strait
ties into stalemate, said Tsai in her speech delivered at Po Chung
Foundation.</P>
      <P>That is the reason that ROC President Chen Shui-bain has proposed
that both sides shelve their disputes in accordance with the "1992
spirit" -- referring to a tacit agreement reached between Taiwan and
the mainland -- so as to engage in dialogues ad communications, she
added.</P>
      <P>She urged Beijing to understand that "one China" is neither a
slogan nor a simple concept, but rather it represents a very serious
question -- the ROC has been existing, a fact that Beijing has been
refused to face and admit.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Tsai added, internationally, Beijing has tried its
best to boycott the presence of Taiwan in the international
community. In the few international organizations that Taiwan is
allowed to take part, Beijing has insisted that Taiwan's national
name, constitution, official titles of its president and premier
cannot appear in the official records of the organizations.</P>
      <P>Analyzing Beijing moves, Tsai said it is attempting to
"depoliticize" the ROC, and to turn it into a de facto economic or
social entity.</P>
      <P>Therefore, She added, Taiwan cannot but take certain immediate
measures to counter Beijing's offense, otherwise, it will disappear
politically.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the great differences over the political,
economic and cultural developments of the two sides will inevitably
bring about many misunderstandings and problems, which she said can
only be minimized through negotiations by the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STUDENTS CALL FOR RATIONAL HANDLING OF MP3 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of university students Monday
called for the government and society to rationally deal with the
April 11 MP3 campus search incident and its aftermath.</P>
      <P>In a press conference at the Legislative Yuan, students from
National Cheng Kung University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Tamkang
University and Taipei Medical College called for a complete
re-evaluation of copyright and Internet-related laws so as to
adequately protect the interests of the original authors of software
and the rights of users.</P>
      <P>In a joint statement, the students explicitly expressed their
dissatisfaction with Tainan prosecutors' entering Cheng Kung
University campus April 11 and seizing 14 computers owned by students
accused of downloading MP3 files.</P>
      <P>They criticized related agencies, including the Ministry of
Education, for immediately judging that the 14 students were guilty
of breaking the law at a time when "society is still debating"
whether the act of downloading MP3 files from the Internet is
illegal.</P>
      <P>The students voiced their opposition to law enforcement
authorities "raiding" college dormitories before copyright and
Internet-related laws are fully reviewed and amended.</P>
      <P>They said if prosecutors or police have to enter a campus to
conduct similar investigations, they must follow lawful procedures.
Campus authorities should have the right to bar prosecutors or police
from entering if they follow illegal procedures, the students added.</P>
      <P>They also suggested that the Ministry of Education, education
institutions and related companies team up to work out measures and
policies serving to protect intellectual property rights as well as
lessening students' financial burdens when using copyright-protected
computer software.</P>
      <P>Tainan prosecutors' April 11 raid on a Cheng Kung University
dormitory to seize 14 computers with downloaded MP3 files, which
prosecutors considered illegal, has focused public attention on the
intellectual property rights issue, police enforcement procedures and
the government's attitude toward the issue.</P>
      <P>Another group of university students from around the island,
which calls itself the Taiwan Democratic Student Movement Alliance,
lodged a protest against the Ministry of Education last Friday,
accusing the ministry of allowing prosecutors to "illegally" enter
the Cheng Kung University dormitory and "arrest" students.</P>
      <P>The alliance also accused the ministry of enforcing a large-scale
crackdown on campus Web sites containing MP3 files, as if the
ministry were a "police headquarters for the sole use of interest
groups."</P>
      <P>The "interest group" they were referring to was the International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which represents the
music industry. The IFPI's Taiwan branch office was quick to throw
its weight behind the April 11 search operation and even went so far
as to say that it will settle for nothing less than the conviction of
the offenders.</P>
      <P>In an open letter to the Ministry of Justice, the student
alliance claimed that most countries are still debating whether
corporate and organizational users should be included in the scope of
punishment for intellectual property rights "violations." The debate
has yet to expand to cover individual users, such as students, the
alliance said.</P>
      <P>In related news, three members of the Control Yuan, the top
watchdog body in the Republic of China, traveled south to Tainan City
to look into the campus search incident themselves.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan members will meet with Cheng Kung University
President Kao Chiang, the 14 students accused of illegally
downloading MP3 files and the Tainan prosecutors in order to further
familiarize themselves with the situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuomintang Legislator Mu Min-chu, who is the convenor
of the Legislative Yuan's Education Committee, urged the Executive
Yuan to accelerate the formation of an inter-division ad hoc group to
exclusively examine and review the Copyrights Law and related
statutes so as to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC PRESIDENT'S JAPAN VISIT ANGERS BEIJING: CBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  22 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported
Sunday that former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui has
arrived in Japan for medical treatment and that "his visit has drawn
anger from Beijing.</P>
      <P>The CBC said Lee will undergo five days of medical examinations
at a hospital in Kurashiki, about 600 kilometers west of Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Beijing had urged Japan not to grant Lee a visa, the national
broadcaster said, adding that "China is nervous he might try to
promote the cause of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>It quoted an editorial in the Saturday edition of mainland
China's People's Daily as saying that permitting the visit would have
strong repercussions.</P>
      <P>"Allowing him to go to Japan will inevitably damage Sino-Japanese
ties and further hurt the feelings of the Chinese people," the
editorial said.</P>
      <P>Relations between Tokyo and Beijing have been difficult at the
best of times, but have become increasingly strained over the past
few months, according to the CBC.</P>
      <P>Trade disputes over cheap mainland Chinese vegetables and the
knowledge that the ill-fated U.S. reconnaissance plane took off from
a base in Japan have increased tensions, it noted.</P>
      <P>But it is Lee, according to mainland China, that is the real
cause of the disagreement, the CBC said, quoting the Xinhua news
agency as saying that "Lee is the chief representative of Taiwan
separatism and the saboteur of stability in the Taiwan Strait."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA MUM ON AIT PERSONNEL RESHUFFLE REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
declined to make any comment Monday on a local newspaper report that
Douglas Paal, a former White House national security aide, may be the
next U.S. representative to the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said it is the ministry's
established policy to refrain from making any comment on speculation
about any U.S. government personnel reshuffle.</P>
      <P>Chang further said that the MOFA has not yet received any
information about a possible shakeup of the leadership of the Taipei
office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which represents
U.S. interests in the ROC in the absence of formal diplomatic
relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based China Times daily reported Monday that Paal, who
served as senior director of the Asian affairs department of the
White House National Security Council during the era of former
President George Bush, may replace Raymond Burghardt as the AIT
Taipei office chief. Chang would not confirm the report, but she said
that Paal is familiar with the ROC's general situation and maintains
extensive ties with Taiwan's academic community.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to point out that communication channels between
the ROC and the United States have operated smoothly and that the new
Bush administration has reaffirmed its commitment to upholding the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) and honoring its relevant promises to the
ROC. The TRA is the U.S. law governing relations with the ROC in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>As to the outlook for the development of ROC-U.S. relations,
Chang said the MOFA adopts a "cautious optimistic" attitude toward
the future development of substantive Taipei-Washington ties.</P>
      <P>A CNA report from San Francisco said U.S. government authorities
have not confirmed the Taiwan media report about Paal's new post in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The China Times dispatch from Washington, D.C. said if all goes
smoothly, Paal is likely to assume the post of the de facto U.S.
ambassador to Taiwan this summer.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the Taipei assignment will be a stint
full of challenges and opportunities for Paal. Paal reportedly has
many friends in Taipei, including Kao Ying-mao, an adviser to the
ROC's National Security Council.</P>
      <P>Political observers said Paal is an active, sophisticated and
quick-witted Asian affairs expert. Some analysts said Paal's active
and no-nonsense working style may give Taipei some pressure if he
takes office here. Nevertheless, they said Paal is basically friendly
to Taiwan and concerned about Taiwan's development.</P>
      <P>The China Times report said although Paal does not support
immediate U.S. sales of the advanced Aegis radar-equipped destroyers
to Taiwan, he has advocated the sale of diesel-powered submarines to
the island.</P>
      <P>The report further said Paal will be an active and competent U.S.
representative to Taiwan and could even help break the current
cross-Taiwan Strait stalemate.</P>
      <P>Paal, now in his 50s, graduated from the Ivy Legaue school Brown
University, with Asian history as his major. He first worked with
the Central Intelligence Agency and then with the Department of
State. He also once worked at the U.S. embassies in Singapore and
mainland China. He joined the White House National Security Council
in 1987 to take charge of Taiwan, mainland China and Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>Paal left public services after former President Bush lost his
reelection bid in 1992. He then set up a non-profit think
tank focusing on Asian-Pacific policy research center. During the
past few years, he has made several trips to Taiwan for attending
seminars or delivering speeches. In addition to speaking mandarin
Chinese, Paal is also versed in Japanese.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-based Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd.
gained pre-tax profits totaling NT$11.6 billion (US$362 million) in
the first quarter of 2001, according to a report released Monday by
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The report, submitted to the technology and information committee
of the Legislative Yuan, also predicted that the telecom company will
reach its set goal for 2001 of NT$12.7 billion in total profits.</P>
      <P>MOTC Executive Vice Minister Ho Cheng-tan said that as Taiwan's

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the Taiwan Confederation of
Trade Unions appealed to President Chen Shui-bian Monday to consider
allowing only local workers to be hired for government-sponsored
infrastructure development projects.</P>
      <P>The trade union representatives, joined by members of the Taiwan
Unemployed Workers and Employment Promotion Alliance, took the issue
of the plight of local workers to the streets, saying the problems
facing local workers include rising unemployment as a result of the
increasing number of foreign laborers being introduced into the
Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>At a rally in front of the Presidential Office, the protesters
called for President Chen to give them a positive response May 1 to
their appeal for the government to use only local workers in its
NT$810 billion worth of public construction projects.</P>
      <P>They appealed to Chen to honor his promise made during the
presidential election campaign to see to it that the number of
foreign laborers is reduced on a yearly basis.</P>
      <P>The trade unions and unemployed workers' representatives called
for Chen to offer a positive response to their appeals May 1, the
first Labor Day since Chen was inaugurated as the ROC president on
May 20, 2000, by announcing a cut by 15,000 in the number of foreign
laborers beginning May 1.</P>
      <P>Kuo Kuo-wen, secretary-general of the Taiwan Confederation of
Trade Unions, quoted the latest government tallies as indicating that
Taiwan's unemployment rate surged to 3.89 percent in March, up 0.16
percent from the previous month, to a single-month record high.</P>
      <P>According to an official from the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, Taiwan's jobless rate is expected to shoot
up to 4 percent in the second quarter of this year, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>He disclosed that members of the confederation will again join
Unemployed Alliance representatives to stage a demonstration in front
of the Presidential Office on Labor Day, calling for President Chen
to face squarely the problem of rising unemployment and provide
effective ways to solve it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATOR  CRITICIZES  GOVERNMENT'S DOUBLE-DEALING ON NUKE PLANT ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the opposition People
First Party (PFP) on Monday criticized the government for its
double-dealing methods concerning the issue of the fourth nuclear
power plant.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Hsieh Chang-chief said that although the ruling
government reluctantly announced the resumption of construction on
the nuclear plant Feb. 14, work has not actually restarted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, speaking at a press conference where he called the move a
government trick, said that such an approach will not only force the
nation into facing steep compensation claims, it may even cause the
nation's economy to collapse.</P>
      <P>Chen Meng-jung, president of the Self Assistance Association of
state-owned Taiwan Power Co., and Hsu Yueng, representative of
Taipower's private shareholders, said at the same press conference
that they went to the site of the partially completed plant in
Kungliao, Taipei County last Thursday.</P>
      <P>They said that when they arrived at their destination, they found
the site empty, with no workers or machinery present. They also noted
that construction was at the same stage as it was last October when
the DPP government abruptly announced a halt to construction.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen also said that if several local contractors
cannot resume work before May 12, then Taipower will terminate their
contracts and ask for compensation. He noted that the new bidding
process that would result would delay construction even longer,
adding that foreign contractors might then want to claim even higher
amounts of compensation from Taipower.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the abrupt decision to halt construction unleashed
pent-up political squabbling and also caused Taiwan's economy to
worsen, adding that the government has still not learned a lesson and
is still resisting resumption of construction on the nuclear plant
despite its promise to restart work.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, legislators of the opposition Kuomintang and People
First Party have expressed their opposition to Taipower listing its
NT$3.177 billion (US$96.56 million) in losses stemming from
suspension of construction in this year's budget expenses.</P>
      <P>KMT legislators Ting Shou-chung, Chao Erh-chung, Liao Hwu-peng,
and Wang Tein-qing have all spoken out against Taipower listing the
losses in its budget.</P>
      <P>Taipower estimated that its losses amounted to NT$3.489 billion
during the suspension of construction, including NT$312 million in
interest payments.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chao said that the government's decision to resume
construction had demonstrated that halting construction was a
mistake, adding that Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi did not
voice a word of apology throughout the process, instead wanting
Taipower to absorb the losses, which Chao added may also lead to
rising electricity rates.</P>
      <P>Other legislators echoed his words, saying that Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung and Lin must apologize.</P>
      <P>As no consensus could be reached on the issue, the legislators
have decided to send the issue of Taipower's losses of NT$3.177
billion listing in its budget to the legislative floor for
discussion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GROWTH IN TAIWAN MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION HITS 26-YEAR LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's manufacturing sector production
fell by 4.95 percent in the first three months of this year as
compared with the same period last year, marking the slowest growth
since the first oil crisis struck the world in 1975.</P>
      <P>Amid worldwide economic sluggishness, Taiwan's industrial and
manufacturing production posted apparent reductions in the first
quarter as a result of diminished foreign trade, said Chang
Yao-tsung, director-general of the Statistics Department under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's manufacturing production figures are not expected to
make a turn for the better in the second quarter. Chang noted that
the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Association of Philadelphia
recently forecast that global trade will decrease further,
consequently affecting Taiwan's industrial and manufacturing sectors.</P>
      <P>According to tallies compiled by the MOEA's Statistics
Department, export orders received by Taiwan exporters and
manufacturers totaled US$12.5 billion in March, down 1.12 percent
from the same month of 2000 but increasing by 16.79 percent from
January this year.</P>
      <P>In March, Taiwan's industrial production posted a reduction of
4.38 percent from the same month last year, while the figure for the
first three months dropped by an annual 4.17 percent. Meanwhile,
manufacturing production in March fell by 5.6 percent from the same
month of 2000 but increased by 12.59 percent from February this year.
Cumulatively, Jan.-March manufacturing production posted a decline of
4.95 percent from the same quarter of the previous year.</P>
      <P>In a recent Taiwan manufacturing sector survey on export order
prospects made by the Statistics Department, about 26 percent of
manufacturers think export orders in April will be better in value
and quantity than those in March, 44.16 percent say the business will
remain unchanged in April, and nearly 30 percent say export orders
will decrease in April.</P>
      <P>Citing that Taiwan's foreign trade and industrial as well as
manufacturing output are closely linked to the economic situations in
the United States and Japan, Chang said the island's growth is
expected to remain in a low ebb during the second quarter as there
are no signs that the economies of Taiwan's two largest trading
partners will recover in the near future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'MINI 3 LINKS' PROGRAM TO BE ADJUSTED: MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "mini three links" program will be
properly adjusted to some extent to meet the demand of residents of
the Republic of China-held frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu, a
senior official in charge of mainland China affairs said Monday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen made the
remarks during an inspection tour of Kinmen aimed at soliciting the
opinions of local government officials, elected representatives and
civic leaders about the "mini three links" program.</P>
      <P>Taiwan took the initiative to open its two offshore defense
outposts for direct trade, mail and shipping links with mainland
China's Xiamen and Mawei in Fujian province at the beginning of this
year.</P>
      <P>Tsai said more than three months after the implementation of
the "open-door" measure, commonly known as the "mini three links"
program, some practical issues have surfaced. "Therefore, we must
conduct an overall review and make necessary policy and
technical adjustments to meet market demand and facilitate
development of our two offshore islands."</P>
      <P>Tsai assured Kinmen county government officials and councilors
that the MAC will finalize its policy review as soon as possible.
Nevertheless, she refrained from giving a concrete timetable for
adjustments.</P>
      <P>"In addition to evaluating the opinions of Kinmen officials and
ordinary residents, we must also take into account the capacity of
relevant administrative agencies and existing hardware and software
as well as the current state and atmosphere of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations," Tsai explained.</P>
      <P>Responding to a demand by Kinmen lawmakers and officials that
the central government unilaterally allow Kinmen and Matsu to serve
as transit ports for mainland China-bound goods and passengers from
Taiwan, Tsai said the MAC will give the proposal favorable
considerations, particularly cargo transshipment.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, only those who have registered legal
abodes in Kinmen or Matsu, both of which lie closer to Fujian
province than to Taiwan, for at least six months can make direct
voyages to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Many Kinmen county officials and councilors have urged the
central government to lift the ban to allow Taiwan residents to
enjoy the same privilege of traveling directly from Kinmen to
Xiamen. In response, Tsai said the government is worrying that once
the ban is lifted, the two offshore islands may have a large number
of "phantom population" which would in turn affect local politics.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsai said the government may consider allowing
Taiwan business people with investments in mainland China and
elderly retired servicemen to make direct sailing from Kinmen or
Matsu to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Tsai denied allegations by some people that ideological thinking
has hindered the government from taking bold steps to boost the
"mini three links" program.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the biggest obstacle to the program lies in
mainland China's reluctance to adopt positive or coordinate moves,
Tsai said the ROC government should not be blamed for slow progress
in the program.</P>
      <P>Until now, mainland China still declines to give the green light
to regular direct Kinmen-Xiamen and Matzu-Mawei shipping services
and instead approves direct voyage applications on a case-by-case
basis.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has consistently adopted a pragmatic manner
in carrying out the program, Tsai said that without mainland China's
cooperation, the government must exercise caution and prudence in
further easing "mini three links" regulations to prevent any
possible adverse effects.</P>
      <P>The top mainland policy planner further said it's still
premature to claim that the "mini three links" program is a flop.
"The program has at least allowed Kinmen and Matsu residents to
legal direct voyages to the mainland," Tsai said, adding that the
program has at least realized the goal of "decriminalization" of
such practices. In the past, direct sailing between Kinmen and
Xiamen was illegal.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said the ROC government earnestly hopes that mainland
China can make more favorable response to the project because it
marks a critical step to improving cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>So far, more than 10 groups of Kinmen residents have made direct
voyages to Xiamen, while only a delegation of elderly Kinmen
natives who have been stranded in the mainland for nearly 50 years
managed to make a direct voyage to Kinmen from Xiamen for a brief
visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JOBLESS RATE PREDICTED TO EXCEED 4 PERCENT IN SECOND QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Due to a deteriorating situation in the
local job market, the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) predicted Monday that unemployment
will continue to worsen in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>C. C. Chen, deputy director of the fourth DGBAS bureau, predicted
that Taiwan's unemployment rate will surpass the 4-percent level in
the second quarter of this year and will not fall until after
September.</P>
      <P>Chen also forecast that the country's jobless rate will average a
record high of 3.9 percent for the whole of 2001, surpassing the 2000
level of 2.99 percent.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the DGBAS showed that the unemployment
rate hit 3.89 percent in March, the second-highest monthly high in
history and the highest jobless rate since Aug. 1985, when the figure
stood at 4.11 percent. Of the 380,000 workers who lost their jobs
last month, 260,000 were male, up 11,000 from February, while the
number of jobless female workers increased 5,000 to reach 120,000.</P>
      <P>At the same time, joblessness among women broke the 3-percent
mark for the first time in March to reach around 3.04 percent, while
the ratio of unemployed males continued climbing to a record high of
4.46 percent last month.</P>
      <P>The average unemployment rate in the first three months of this
year was 3.66 percent, up 0.84 percentage points from the same period
a year ago.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS tallies showed that the number of unemployed workers
surged to a record high of 380,000 in March, while the number of
people affected totaled around 939,000.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, 162,000 people lost their jobs in March, up
19,000 from the February level, becuase of factory closures or
business streamlining.</P>
      <P>If the so-called "hidden unemployed population" -- those who are
willing to work but have not yet found a job -- was added, the broad
March unemployment rate would reach an historical high of 5.76
percent, an increase of 0.22 percentage points from February, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of employed workers in Taiwan totaled 9.37
million in March, representing the third consecutive monthly drop,
the DGBAS statistics indicated. Compared to the December level, the
figure represents a drop of 171,000 employed people.</P>
      <P>During the first quarter, the number of employed workers
islandwide averaged 9.41 million, a fall of 25,000 from the same
period in 2000, which marked the first decline in a decade.</P>
      <P>In terms of academic backgrounds, workers of junior high school
education level posted the largest unemployment rate of 5.07 percent,
while the percentage of senior high school graduates also hit around
4.3 percent.</P>
      <P>The jobless rate of nine cities and counties was higher than 4
percent in March, with Kaohsiung County posting the highest rate of
4.89, followed by Tainan City with 4.77 percent and Ilan County with
4.68 percent. Meanwhile, the jobless percentages registered in
Keelung City, Hualien County, Tainan County, Nantou County, Taichung
County and Kaohsiung City all were above the 4-percent level.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
the Republic of China is willing to play a pivotal role in
educational development in Asia.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge in a speech delivered at the opening of the
Second Asian Physics Olympiad.</P>
      <P>Chen said the past century's progress in physics has had amazing
effects on human life and that achievements in physics over the past
50 years have also contributed much to advances in material life.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said, most major discoveries in physics have been
achieved by Western countries. "Asian countries have been relatively
weak in this regard," the president noted, adding that Asian
countries should give priority to boosting scientific education and
cultivation of talent in order to catch up with Western countries in
scientific and technological development.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is convinced that the Asian Physics Olympiad will
contribute to the promotion and upgrading of scientific education in
the region. "We are also hopeful that the event will help increase
international cultural and educational exchanges and allow Asian
youths to forge friendships in preparation for possible research
cooperation in the future," he added.</P>
      <P>The president also advised senior high school students
participating in the current physics contest not to worry too much
about the results of the race. "Winning or losing is just a fleeting
event. Forging friendships is the most important thing," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, a co-winner of the 1986
Nobel Prize in chemistry, echoed President Chen's views, saying that
the outcome of the Olympiad competition is not very important.</P>
      <P>"You just need to do your utmost. Posing questions and finding
new answers are the driving force behind progress in scientific
study, and scientific knowledge is accumulated through long-term
research by a number of scientists," Lee said, adding that
researchers in countries around the world should stop competing and
opt for cooperation in order to resolve many thorny issues and
enhance the well-being of mankind.</P>
      <P>A total of 81 senior high school students from 12 countries are
taking part in the current competition. The participating countries
are Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia,
Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Jordan, Israel, India and the host ROC.
Additionally, Japan and Qatar have sent observers to the event.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, which won the top prize in the first Asian
physics Olympiad held last year, declined to participate in the race
apparently for political reasons.</P>
      <P>The results of the competition will be announced Sunday evening.
The next Olympiad will be held in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The ROC will select five students from its team to the ongoing
competition to take part in an international physics Olympiad
scheduled to be held in Turkey in July this year.</P>
      <P>The ROC is scheduled to host the 2003 international physics
Olympiad.</P>

      <P>Taichung district prosecutors on
Monday pressed charges of attempted murder and corruption on Taichung
County Speaker Yen Ching-piao, who has been detained since Feb. 28
and had been allowed only hours before to be released on bail.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice's "black gold"

    <HEADLINE>ROC LAWMAKERS TO VISIT JAPAN TO PUSH FOR BETTER EXCHANGE MECHANISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Republic of China legislators
will leave for Japan Tuesday to thank Japanese officials and
parliamentarians who helped push the Japanese government into issuing
a visa for former ROC President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tang Pi-o of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said at a news conference Monday that a number of Japanese
parliamentarians of different political stripes had formed a
supra-party alliance to press their government to approve Lee's visit
to Japan for medical purposes.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we'll go to Japan to thank them and several other
Japanese government officials for their efforts to help Lee realize
his Japan travel plan," said Tang.</P>
      <P>Other legislators expected to visit Japan along with Tang will
include Yu Cheng-tao of the DPP and Chen Hung-chi of the main
opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Tang said she and her legislative colleagues are glad about the
Japanese government's 11th-hour decision to ignore mainland China's
"unreasonable and irrational opposition" and grant Lee a visa on
humanitarian grounds.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that protecting human rights is a universal
value," Tang said, adding that Japan's approval of Lee's visit
highlights this principle and should be recognized by the people of
both the ROC and Japan.</P>
      <P>Tang said she is convinced that the Japanese government decision
will also have a positive effect on future relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>In view of mainland China's perennial diplomatic embargo against
Taiwan, Tang said she and her colleagues will take advantage of their
visit to discuss with their Japanese counterparts the establishment
of an effective mechanism for exchanges and dialogue among ROC and
Japanese parliamentarians.</P>
      <P>In related developments, Chang Fu-mei, chairwoman of the
Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC), denied an
allegation Monday that the commission had mobilized ROC expatriates
in Japan to greet Lee upon his arrival in Osaka Sunday.</P>
      <P>Opposition New Party Legislator Elmer Feng asked Chang at a
meeting of the Legislative Yuan's foreign and overseas Chinese
affairs committee whether she knew that "many of those who turned out
to greet Lee at the Kansai International Airport and a posh Osaka
hotel were pro-Taiwan independence activists."</P>
      <P>Feng, who has never hesitated to express his pro-unification
stance, also expressed his suspicion that the OCAC had mobilized
"pro-independence expatriates" in Japan to welcome Lee.</P>
      <P>In response, Chang pointed out that as Lee's Japan visit is
purely for medical reasons, the OCAC did not see the need to arrange
for ROC expatriates in Japan to greet Lee at either the airport or
the hotel. "All the well-wishers turned out voluntarily," she
stressed.</P>
      <P>Lee, 78, arrived in Osaka Sunday for his first visit to Japan
since 1985, when he made a stopover on his way home after a visit to
Latin America in his capacity as the ROC vice president.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Lee took a stroll and visited the ancient Osaka castle
in the company of a large crowd of security staff and journalists.</P>
      <P>He avoided politics, sticking to polite remarks about the history
of Japan, the sights of Osaka and cherry blossom, according to
reports from Japan.</P>
      <P>The former president is scheduled to go to a hospital in the city
of Kurishiki Tuesday, about 600 kilometers west of Tokyo, for an
expert medical evaluation of a heart condition.</P>

      <P>Police officials announced Monday that
they have arrested 32 suspects including five students allegedly
involved in running some 37 websites selling MP3 music files online.
They added that they had seized more than 36,000 compact discs (CD)
on which MP3 files were stored.</P>
      <P>The police have forwarded the case to the Prosecutor's Office of
Taipei District Court for further investigation into possible
violations of intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Criminal Investigation Bureau(CIB) said that
Taipei District Prosecutor Chang Shau-ping, who is in charge of
investigating computer related crimes, instructed CIB staff in March
to shut down any websites engaged in illegally selling pirated music
CDs, MP3 music files, or other files.</P>
      <P>In the course of their investigations, the police discovered 37
networks and arrested 32 suspects including five students.</P>
      <P>Seventeen of the sites allegedly offered illegal MP3 music CDs,
while the remainder were engaged in illegal sales of pirated copies
of CDs, police said.</P>
      <P>Police found that all the operators of the sites were equipped
with high speed CD burners. They added that a suspect surnamed Chow
had 12 high speed CD burners, and used his site to sell illegal MP3
music CDs, MP3 music files, pirated music CDs and pornography.</P>
      <P>Police estimated that Chow's site accumulated NT$5 million in
profits since he began it in 1998. Chow successfully evaded police
investigators three times in the past.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, police also forwarded the "Home of Little Lu" Website
uncovered by the International Federation of the Phonographic
Industry (IFPI) to Taipei District Court for further investigation.
The site allegedly allows visitors to illegally download MP3 music
files.</P>
      <P>Police called on the public to observe intellectual property

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu said Monday that the U.S. and Japanese governments' issuance of
visitor visas to former ROC President Lee Teng-hui has great meaning
and should inspire Beijing to use new thinking in the new age.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks during a meeting Monday morning with visiting
president of the American Enterprise Institute, Christopher Demuth.</P>
      <P>Lu especially expressed gratitude to the U.S. government, which
granted Lee a multiple-entry visa for a period of five years and
imposed no restrictions on Lee's activities during his planned
early-May trip to the United States.</P>
      <P>Lu indicated that it was quite a breakthrough for the Japanese
government to allow former president Lee to visit Japan, which she
said has previously succumbed to mainland China's demands because of
its sense of guilt about its invasion of China. "It is gratifying
that the Japanese government gave Lee a visa on humanitarian
considerations," she said.</P>
      <P>She said she hopes Japan's government and people can walk out of
the shadows of history.</P>
      <P>For his part, DeMuth said he agreed with Lu that Lee is now an
ordinary citizen and has the right to travel anywhere he wishes, and
certainly for medical purposes. He said the Japanese government
doesn't have to explain why it issued Lee a visa, adding that Beijing
authorities should not take irrational action against the Japanese
government over this matter.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Lu mentioned that she has always supported
uniting Japan, Korea and Taiwan to form an Asia Pacific alliance. She
said that such a regional organization would contribute significantly
to the promotion of peace and stability in the region.</P>
      <P>As to the U.S. role in cross-strait ties, DeMuth said Washington
should not involve itself in the cross-strait dispute over
reunification or independence, but should make it clear that the
United States would not permit any solution involving force.</P>
      <P>Referring to arms sales, DeMuth said the U.S. government should
simply consider Taiwan's defense needs to ensure its people's safety.</P>
      <P>Lu expressed the hope that the Bush Administration will adopt a
more positive and friendly Taiwan policy. She suggested that the
United States strengthen bilateral high-level visits and help Taiwan
to quickly enter international organizations such as the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and World Health Organization (WHO).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
told a visiting U.S. think tank expert Monday that he hopes to meet
the institute's senior fellows for wide-ranging discussions during
his U.S. transit stop in May en route to Latin America.</P>
      <P>Chen told Christopher DeMuth, president of the American
Enterprise Institute (AEI), that he would like to exchange opinions
with AEI scholars on such issues as future Taipei-Washington
relations and the current situation in the Taiwan Strait during his
brief stopover.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he has visited the think tank on many occasions in
the past and he praised AEI for its long-term concern for and
contributions to the security of the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed respect for AEI Senior Vice
President John R. Bolton -- who has been nominated to serve as the
new U.S. undersecretary of state for arms control, non-proliferation
and international security in the Bush administration -- for his
staunch vocal support of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>DeMuth pointed out that many other officials in the current U.S.
administration, including U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, once
worked for the influential think tank.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that these officials are all friends of the
Republic of China and that he is certain that bilateral relations
will undergo substantial improvements in the future.</P>
      <P>Responding to DeMuth's suggestion that Taiwan should strengthen
its financial reform initiatives, Chen admitted that Taiwan does
indeed have many long-standing financial problems, the seriousness of
which were "covered up" in the past.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he continued, his government has given financial
reform a top priority and is pushing for the completion of related

    <HEADLINE>MAC MULLING WAYS TO TACKLE SIDE EFFECTS OF `MINI THREE LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to cope with the side effects of
the "mini three links" on Taiwan-controlled offshore islands, a
high-ranking Republic of China official said Monday that the
government will adjust its current policy out of practical need.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
the ROC's top government agency in charge of Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, made the remarks in a policy-review meeting here
attended by local government officials and opinion leaders.</P>
      <P>In response to a demand by local representatives that the central
government ease its current rules on household registration in order
to root out the increasing "ghost population" on Kinmen, Tsai
promised that the MAC will review and adjust its measures on the
"mini three links" by giving priority to people with special needs.</P>
      <P>The "ghost population" refers to residents of Taiwan proper who
fraudulently obtain Kinmen or Matsu household registration in order
to allow them to travel directly to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the problem was unforeseen by the MAC while it was
setting up the direct trade, shipping and postal links between Kinmen
and Matsu and mainland China, Tsai said that lowering or abolishing
the current household registration requirements will be very
difficult in practice, out of consideration of social order, the
local governments' administrative abilities and their hardware and
software facilities.</P>
      <P>The MAC head said that her council will make a move to improve
its current measures based on practical needs and that legal
residents of Kinmen and Matsu will not be the only people from Taiwan
allowed to enjoy direct sailings to mainland China.</P>
      <P>In the future, Taiwan businessmen who need to travel frequently
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and retired veterans may
not be necessarily subjected to the clause that requires would-be
travelers to the mainland through the offshore islands to be legally
registered as resident of the islands for six months.</P>
      <P>Blaming the emergence of the "ghost population" on the central
government's establishment of the "mini three links," Kinmen County
Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai claimed that the problem has had a negative
impact on local development and public order.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the number of residents with legal abode on
the island had increased to 55,153 as of the end of March, a growth
of 3,270 people compared to the level posted a year ago.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that the central government relax the current
six-month legal abode registration to 15 days in order to reduce the
pressure from the "ghost population."</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Council Deputy Speaker Hsu Yu-chao further pointed
out that the invasion of the large amount of "ghost population" will
seriously affect the "ecosystem" of Kinmen's politics, especially the
legislative and county chief elections slated for December.</P>
      <P>Hsu urged the central government to pay special heed to this
phenomenon and warned that next year's election for local county
councilors will be re-aligned by those "migrant troops."</P>
      <P>Disagreeing with Chen's proposal, lawmaker Chen Ching-pao of the
opposition Kuomintang contended that it would be better to simply not
set any restrictions on household registration than lower the
ceiling. New Party legislator Lee Chu-feng suggested that the MAC
implement a quota system to first grant Taiwan businessmen and
retired servicemen priority treatment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GIO CHIEF CRITICIZES `INCORRECT' XINHUA REPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Director-General Su Cheng-ping of the
Government Information Office (GIO) Monday criticized reports by
mainland China's Xinhua News Agency for making "incorrect reports"
about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su, who is also the government spokesman, said the GIO has
recently received many complaints from the public about reports by
the Xinhua journalists, saying they have been "incorrect" and "lies."</P>
      <P>Taiwan opened its doors to mainland reporters on a regular basis
late last year.</P>
      <P>He cited several Xinhua reports to support his accusations.</P>
      <P>First, he said, a Xinhua report dated April 21 from Taipei said
that former President Lee Teng-hui was blasted by the public for
using health reasons to apply for a visa to Japan in order to engage
in political activities there.</P>
      <P>Su said that Taiwan is free country in which everybody is allowed
to air his or her voice, and it is understandable that some local
people may have different views about Lee's ongoing Japan visit, but
he claimed it is "doubtful" whether Lee's visit was strongly opposed
or rapped by most local people.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, although the Xinhua reporters did interview
certain local figures, their views would not necessarily represent
the opinions of the majority of people.</P>
      <P>Second, Su said, another Taipei-datelined Xinhua report on April
20 said that well-known Taiwan figures including former Legislative
Yuan President Liang Su-jung and former Veteran Affairs Commission
Chairman Hsu Li-lung had said political motives were behind Lee's bid
to visit Japan.</P>
      <P>Without denying the report, Su said that Liang and Hsu are just
two well-known local figures and that the Xinhua reporters should
contact more people before filing this kind of report.</P>
      <P>He also cited a Xinhua report about the Dalai Lama's Taiwan visit
on March 31 which said that "hundreds" of local people held an
anti-Tibet independence protest in front of the Tibetan spiritual
leader's hotel.</P>
      <P>Su admitted that local people protested the Dalai Lama's visit,
but claimed that the number of protesters was actually far less that
what Xinhua had given.</P>
      <P>Su said that the government has allowed the mainland journalists
to work on the island in the hope that they will help promote mutual
understanding between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and that he
is worried that this kind of "incorrect reporting" will be
detrimental.</P>
      <P>Su termed the performance of the mainland reporters as "not
professional enough," but he said the GIO would not take any
disciplinary measures against them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-CHINESE COMMUNIST OFFICIAL'S CONFESSIONS SHED LIGHT ON TIANANMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bao Tong, a reform-minded senior
Chinese Communist official who took the fall for being sympathetic to
the student democracy movement of 1989, confirmed Monday that a
leaked document containing his "confessions" appeared genuine.</P>
      <P>Bao, who lives in Beijing after serving seven years in prison,
told CNA in a phone interview that he did not personally read the
document published that day in the Hong Kong Economic Journal.</P>
      <P>However, he added, from what others told him, the 16-point
confession indeed seemed to be the one he wrote in jail in 1989 after
the bloody Tiananmen Square massacre.</P>
      <P>Bao said that he did not know who provided the Hong Kong daily
with the document, but joked that the fact Beijing leaders did not
give him trouble over the leak could mean that "mainland China has
made progress."</P>
      <P>According to the Hong Kong Economic Journal, the unnamed person
who provided the document claimed that Bao was willing to let the
document come to light in order to follow in the spirit of the person
who provided similarly revealing material for a recent book titled
"The Tiananmen Papers."</P>
      <P>Bao's confession gave a detailed look into his alleged part in
the intra-party power struggle that finally led to the emergence of a
hawkish faction and the resultant massacre.</P>
      <P>The 16-point confession included Bao's admittance that in 1989,
he criticized an April 26 editorial in the People's Daily denouncing
the student movement. He called the editorial "overly rigid" and
"lacking sufficient analysis."</P>
      <P>Bao also "confessed" to twice mixing into the crowd of

    <HEADLINE>INFLUENTIAL SENATOR PRAISES BUSH'S DEFENSE PACKAGE FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   April   23  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) praised Monday the Bush
administration's approval of a robust arms sale package to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Helms said in a press release the move demonstrates that the
United States, at long last, has an administration that is taking
the critical matter of Taiwan's defense seriously.</P>
      <P>"I congratulate President Bush and his administration for their
courageous decision to approve the most significant defense package
for Taiwan in at least nine years," Helms said.</P>
      <P>The influential senator said he thinks that criticism of
President Bush over the arms sale package is sure to follow.</P>
      <P>"But those who would berate the President should first
acknowledge that the President's action is well within the
requirements of the law in terms of the United States' commitment to
the defense of Taiwan," Helms said in the news release.</P>
      <P>He went on to point out that the defense systems listed in the
latest arms sale package "will go a long way toward helping our
friends on Taiwan resist coercion from an increasingly belligerent
Communist China."</P>
      <P>For his part, Helms said, he is "unalterably persuaded that the
sale of Aegis destroyers is also justified in light of the
outrageous actions of the leaders in Beijing."</P>
      <P>Helms further said now that a number of weaponry systems have
been approved for sale to Taiwan, he looks forward to continuing his
support of the Bush administration's work on other aspects of the
U.S. defense relationship with Taiwan, such as communications and
operational training.</P>
      <P>Congressional aides said Bush administration officials informed
Senate and House leaders, including Helms, Monday afternoon by
phone that President Bush has approved the sale of four Kidd-class
destroyers and 12 P-3 Orion submarine-killer aircraft to Taiwan, in
addition to helping Taiwan purchase eight diesel submarines.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bush promised to decide in two years whether to sell
Taiwan the highly advanced Aegis radar-equipped Arleigh Burke
destroyers based on the development in mainland China's missile
deployment against Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GEPHARDT EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER U.S. DECISION NOT TO SELL AEGIS TO ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. House Democratic leader Richard
A. Gephardt said Monday that he has serious questions regarding the
Bush administration's decision not to sell Taiwan destroyers equipped
with the advanced Aegis system "given the sizable buildup of military
forces on the mainland side of the Taiwan Straits."</P>
      <P>Expressing his full support for providing Taiwan with the
assistance and equipment necessary for its self-defense, Gephardt
said that "China's military buildup and other provocative acts
demonstrate that the United States must have a comprehensive, focused
and consistent policy toward that nation."</P>
      <P>"Part of such a policy is clearly assisting Taiwan. But it also
includes asserting our own security priorities, especially in the
aftermath of the navy surveillance plane incident earlier this
month," the Missouri Democrat added.</P>
      <P>He said that he is disappointed that Washington has still not
secured an agreement from Beijing for the return of the U.S. Navy
surveillance aircraft. He also expressed concern over the fact that
the United States has not resumed surveillance flights in the region,
"if only to demonstrate our right to do so in international
airspace."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the congressional Deomcratic leader also noted that
"our policy must also include calling on China to respect
international human rights standards. Over the past several weeks,
China has detained a number of U.S. citizens and residents who have
been pursuing scholarly work," said Gephardt.</P>
      <P>He urged the Bush administration to "press forcefully for the
release of these individuals and compliance with the rule of law,"
saying that "the recent release of our navy air crew must not divert
us from attention to these ongoing and troubling matters."</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two senior U.S. officials recommended
adding two Aegis destroyers to the U.S. Navy that could be
transferred to Taiwan in the event that Beijing continues to heighten
its military intimidation of the island, sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>U.S. Deputy State Secretary Richard Armitage and Deputy Defense
Secretary Paul Wolfowitz were quoted as recommending to U.S.
President George W. Bush last week that he authorize the additional
destroyers as an alternative to committing to a decision on the sale
of such destroyers to Taiwan at the annual arms sales meeting
scheduled for Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Whether their recommendation was accepted was not immediately
clear, sources added.</P>
      <P>However, officials said that Bush has already made a decision on
the arms sales package for this year and that the Arleigh Burke-class
destroyers equipped with the Aegis system that Taiwan has requested
to purchase will not be on the list.</P>
      <P>Instead, officials added, the decision to sell the Aegis
destroyers will be deferred, and a future decision will be made in
two years depending on the situation regarding mainland Chinese
missile deployments across from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Destroyers and cruisers equipped with the cutting-edge Aegis
combat management system form the backbone of the U.S. Navy, which
currently has 31 Aegis destroyers in service and plans to build an
additional 27 such destroyers.</P>
      <P>If Bush were to decide to build two additional destroyers, the
U.S. Congress would have to first agree to the additional budget.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTER CALLS FOR MERGERS IN DOMESTIC INSURANCE SECTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The minister of finance said Tuesday that
those domestic insurance companies unable to maintain the minimum
required amount of NT$2 billion (US$625 million) in capital should
seek to merge with other companies in the sector.</P>
      <P>Minister Yen Ching-chang said that although all domestic life
insurance firms have been able to maintain the NT$2 billion minimum,
some firms in the property insurance sector have not met the standard
set by the ministry. He called for the merging of those companies as
a means of maintaining the minimum capital requirement.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Department of Insurance
of the Ministry of Finance, eight of the 31 domestic insurance
companies do not meet the minimum capital requirement.</P>
      <P>As several banks and securities firms merged after the
Legislative Yuan passed a law on business mergers last November, the
ministry reported that at least three mergers among Taiwan property
insurance firms will take place this year.</P>
      <P>An official at Fubon Insurance Co. Ltd., Taiwan's leading
insurance company, told the press that the firm has recently
contacted five or six of its counterparts to discuss possible
business mergers, adding that a merger is expected to happen some
time this year.</P>
      <P>Although it leads the field in Taiwan's insurance sector, Fubon
Insurance Co. Ltd. is ranked a lowly 55th among Asia's largest
insurance companies, Yen noted.</P>
      <P>He added that 630 mergers took place worldwide in 1999, a 15
percent increase over the number in 1998, forcing small- and
middle-sized enterprises to follow suit in order to remain
competitive with their larger counterparts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. DEFERS DECISION ON AEGIS DESTROYERS SALE TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush has
deferred a decision on selling Taiwan destroyers equipped with the
state-of-the-art radar system while approving the
sale of other weaponry requested by the island, a senior White House
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>But Bush also said he would review Taiwan's request for the
Arleigh Burke-class destroyers equipped with the Aegis radar system
over the next two years in light of the threats posed by mainland
China's deployment of missiles along its southeastern coast opposite
Taiwan, the official said.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the arms sale meeting between Taiwan and the U.S.
on Taiwan's purchase request list, the official from the National
Security Council gave a background briefing on the arms that Bush had
approved for sale to Taiwan. These include four Kidd-class
destroyers, eight diesel submarines designed to counter blockades and
invasions, 12 P-3C Orion Aircraft, and Paladin self-propelled
artillery system.</P>
      <P>But the U.S. deferred a decision on the sale of the four Arleigh
Burke-class destroyers as well as Apache Long Bow helicopters and M1
tanks. As for the new PAC-3 version of the Patriot air defense
missile, it is still in the research and development stage in the
United States, and the White House will review the issue with Taiwan
later, the official said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, which is worth more than US$4
billion, represents the largest single arms sale to Taiwan in nine
years since the U.S. announced the sale of F-16 fighter jets to
Taiwan in 1992 under the old Bush administration.</P>
      <P>The senior official urged mainland China to ease tensions in the
Taiwan Strait and reduce the number of guided missiles deployed
opposite Taiwan, which now stands at about 300.</P>
      <P>The official also said the Bush administration will review within
the next two years Taiwan's request for the Aegis destroyers, which
are able to perform search and missile guidance functions and can
track 100 or more targets simultaneously.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, the major positive result of the Bush decision is the
approval of the sale to the island of eight diesel submarines. It is
understood that Taiwan has requested the 209 model designed by
Germany and that General Dynamics of the United States will be in
charge of construction and assembly, with the U.S. Navy taking stock
of the submarines before delivering them to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Sources in Washington said that the White House leak of the arms
sales decision by Bush Monday night was in consistence with the
White House's promise not to have prior consultations with the
mainland on the issue. They said it is hoped the information will
ease the potential impact of the arms sale decision on relations
between Washington and Beijing, already strained because of the
recent incident involving a downed U.S. reconnaissance plane.</P>
      <P>The White House will closely monitor the response from Beijing,
Taipei and the U.S. Congress, hoping that the arms sale decision will
not turn into another diplomatic crisis, sources added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OFFICER'S DEATH REKINDLES DEBATE ON SAFETY OF RURAL POLICE STATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien  County,  Taiwan, April 24 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An officer was killed in
the line of duty at a rural Hualien County police station by a
high-caliber bench-made bullet Monday night, rekindling a debate on
how the safety of such short-handed stations can be improved.</P>
      <P>Judging from his missing firearm and 24 bullets, police
speculated that the suspect killed officer Lee Chien-nan, 44, for the
purpose of making off with his standard police-issue pistol.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Chang Po-ya, who visited the murdered officer's
family and the crime scene Tuesday, expressed her concern for the
safety of small rural police stations that are manned by only three
officers in the day and a single officer at night.</P>
      <P>She went on to say that an experimental plan last year to have
rural stations work together for easier coordination and force
projection could not be carried out in certain areas -- including the
station where Lee was killed -- due to local opposition.</P>
      <P>Despite police reassurances to the contrary, residents in certain
townships feared that their local stations would be merged with
bigger stations under the proposed plan, or that their areas would be
left with less police protection.</P>
      <P>Chang said that she has already instructed the National Police
Administration (NPA) to re-examine the issue.</P>
      <P>NPA Director-General Wang Chin-wang, who accompanied Chang on the
inspection visit, said that his administration will look into the
safety issue for officers on duty and that Lee's family will receive
approximately NT$11 million (US$334,000) in pension and other funds.</P>
      <P>Police said that the custom-made bullet was 7.8 centimeters long
and 2 centimeters in diameter and was fashioned out of solid steel.
Tearing through the seated officer's chair, the bullet entered Lee's
back and exited from the right side of his chest. It appeared to have
been fired from outside a window, police added.</P>
      <P>Investigators said that the bullet made a 15-centimeter-deep hole
in the opposite wall and appeared undented by the force of the
impact.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was transferred to the rural post last February, was
decorated 35 times during his 15-year service on the police force. He
is survived by his 91-year-old father as well as his wife and three
daughters, aged 22, 18 and 12.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC KEEPS LOW PROFILE ON U.S. ARMS SALE PACKAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government kept a
low profile Tuesday on reports that U.S. President George W. Bush
will approve a robust arms sales package worth more than US$4 billion
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Reports from Washington, D.C. said the Bush administration has
almost finalized its arms sales package to Taiwan on the eve of the
opening of an annual ROC-U.S. arms procurement meeting.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the U.S. government put off a decision
Monday on whether to sell Taiwan destroyers equipped with the
state-of-the-art Aegis radar system, instead deciding to offer Taiwan
four Kidd-class destroyers, a dozen anti-submarine P-3 "Orion"
aircraft and eight diesel submarines.</P>
      <P>It is the biggest arms package for Taiwan since 1992 when the
U.S. government agreed to sell the island 150 F-16 jet fighters.
Observers said the new U.S. sale package would vastly improve
Taiwan's naval defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, Presidential Office officials said the
ROC government appreciates the positive U.S. response to Taiwan's
requests, which they said were based on the island's defense needs.</P>
      <P>The officials, however, would not touch on any specific item on
Taiwan's arms shopping list.</P>
      <P>Sources said that although Bush has deferred a decision on the
sale of four Aegis radar-equipped Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, the
ROC will continue negotiations for purchasing them, also the biggest
prize on Taiwan's wish list.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Huang Suey-sheng said the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) has not yet received any information about the results
of annual ROC-U.S. arms talks, which opened Tuesday in suburban
Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the ROC has a tacit understanding with the
United States that it will refrain from making any comments on the
details of the U.S. arms sales package for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Huang stressed that the ROC will do its utmost to
acquire advanced military hardware and software to beef up Taiwan's
defense capabilities and contribute to stability and security in the
Asia-Pacific area.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on the U.S. decision to sell Taiwan four
Kidd-class destroyers, Huang said the MND would not make any comment
on the deal regarding any single weaponry item.</P>
      <P>However, he added later that the ROC military has never said it
would definitely purchase Kidd-class warships.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reaffirmed its
stance on remaining silent on arms procurement issues.</P>
      <P>"We have no comment yet. The talks are still going on and have
not ended," MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said.</P>
      <P>In view of the complexity and sensitivity of arms procurement
issues, relevant ROC government agencies and officials have kept low
profile and refrained from making any forecast on the outcome of the
ongoing arms talks and details of the possible U.S. sales package.</P>
      <P>Senior officials simply stressed that the ROC's arms procurement
plans are mainly designed to safeguard Taiwan's security and maintain
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SCHOLAR SAYS U.S. ARMS SALE DECISION BENEFICIAL TO RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local scholar said Tuesday that an
anticipated U.S. decision to sell Taiwan Kidd-class destroyers
instead of Aegis-equipped destroyers will have positive significance
for Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations in the short term.</P>
      <P>However, Chang Wu-ueh, director of Tamkang University's Institute
of Mainland Chinese Research, added that the long-term effects on
trilateral relations are not so clear.</P>
      <P>Chang said the reported list of weapons that the United States
plans to sell Taiwan this year will satisfy the island's "bottom
line" and will be acceptable to Taipei, Washington and Beijing
despite the fact that none of the three will be fully satisfied.</P>
      <P>He speculated that if mainland China were to continue developing
its military to intimidate Taiwan or establish a military alliance
with Russia and India, then the United States will likely consider
further arms sales to Taiwan in order to prevent an obvious imbalance
in the region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former foreign minister Jason Hu said that any
decisions coming out of an arms sales meeting being held in
Washington should not be seen as standing for support of Taiwan
independence or any particular ideology.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang deputy secretary-general added that he
was optimistic about reports that the Bush administration is prepared
to sell Taiwan several types of defensive weapons, including
diesel-electric submarines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1ST DIRECT REPATRIATION OF MAINLAND IMMIGRANTS FROM MATSU OCCURS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Matsu,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland Chinese ferry boat sailed
directly to the Republic of China-held frontline island of Matsu
Tuesday to take back 201 illegal mainland immigrants.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that a mainland boat has made a direct
voyage to Matsu to take back detained illegal mainland immigrants. In
the past, ROC boats first shipped illegal mainland immigrants to the
middle line of the Taiwan Strait, where mainland ferries would wait
to take back the stowaways.</P>
      <P>Matsu officials said the new practice has made repatriation of
illegal mainland immigrants smoother, safer and faster.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the Red Cross Society on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, the mainland ferry, christened Haixia, sailed into
Matsu's Fuao port for the first time at around 9 a.m. to take back
the all-female group of illegal mainland immigrants.</P>
      <P>On its first direct voyage to Matsu, the Haixia also shipped 10
Taiwan fugitives to the ROC's offshore defense outpost.</P>
      <P>The 10 fugitives have been wanted for various criminal charges,
including murder, fraud and counterfeiting mainland and foreign
currencies. They fled to the mainland and were arrested by police
authorities there recently. Their repatriation marked yet another
achievement in cross-Taiwan Strait cooperation in cracking down on
crime.</P>
      <P>Among the repatriated fugitives was Cheng Shen-tien, allegedly
the mastermind of a criminal ring specializing in counterfeiting the
mainland Chinese currency and the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Cheng, 45 fled to mainland China after Taiwan police raided his
bogus bank note manufacturing factory in Tainan County in November
1998. During the raid, police seized fake mainland currency with a
total face value of 60 million renminbi as well as a large number of
fake US$100 notes.</P>
      <P>Cheng and his accomplices were accused of intending to ship the
bogus bills to the mainland for laundering or to use them to purchase
arms and illegal drugs for sale to Taiwan, the United States, Japan
and South Korea.</P>
      <P>After Tuesday's repatriation, there are still 200 illegal
mainland immigrants at the Matsu detention center, who will be
repatriated later.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the establishment of a direct repatriation model
will enable us to simplify preparations for sending back seized
illegal mainland immigrants, who have become a financial burden for
the ROC in recent years," said a Matsu official.</P>
      <P>In related news, 36 mainland fishermen who four days ago were
sentenced to one year in prison with a five-year suspension for
smuggling farm produce to Kinmen, another ROC frontline island, were
repatriated from Kinmen's Shuitou wharf Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The mainland fishermen, led by Wang Dongshui, were arrested by
ROC coast guard officers on April 14 while they were attempting to
smuggle more than 5,000 kilograms of mushroom seedlings to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangement of the Kinmen branch of the Red Cross
Society, a Kinmen-registered fishing boat shipped the mainland
fishermen to the middle line of the Taiwan Strait where a mainland
boat was waiting to take them back.</P>
      <P>Since the ROC has opened its two offshore defense outposts of
Kinmen and Matsu for direct trade, mail and shipping links with
mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei in Fujian province, commonly known
as the "mini three links" program, Kinmen officials said they hope a
direct repatriation model can be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As Beijing has cold-shouldered the Taiwan-initiated "mini three
links" program, the project has not yet proceeded smoothly. Mainland
China still declines to allow regular direct Kinmen-Xiamen and
Matsu-Mawei voyages and instead approves applications for direct
sailing on a case-by-case basis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIMITED ACCESS FOR MEDIA DURING LEE'S CORNELL VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cornell University Vice President for
University Relations Henrik Dullea said Monday that the media will be
granted "limited access" to former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui during his forthcoming visit to the institution, his alma
mater.</P>
      <P>Dullea said that although the U.S. State Department has not
imposed any restrictions on Lee's visit to Cornell University May
2-4, he told CNA that the university authorities have decided to put
on a low-key reception for the former ROC head of state at the
request of Lee's own office.</P>
      <P>Dullea stressed that the visit will be private and low profile
and that Lee will not give any public speech or hold news
conferences. He added that the university will "properly" and
"carefully" deal with possible protests from mainland Chinese
students.</P>
      <P>Dullea, who personally took part in the reception for Lee during
his first return to Cornell in 1995, said that the former president
had revealed his willingness to visit again last December. But the
plan has been delayed until now due to his personal physical
conditions, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lee and his wife are scheduled to arrive in Ithaca May 2, and
hundreds of ROC nationals residing in the eastern United States will
welcome the couple at the local airport. Cornell University President
Hunter R. Rawlings III will host a dinner banquet for the couple
later the same day.</P>
      <P>On May 3, Lee will meet with his granddaughter, who is currently
studying at Cornell, tour the university's campus, and personally
preside over a ceremony to mark the establishment of the "Lee
Teng-hui Institute for Scientific Research."</P>
      <P>According to Cornell authorities, the research center will be
accommodated inside the newly built Duffield Hall and will operate
with donations by friends of Lee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP SAID MORE LIKELY TO COOPERATE WITH KMT AFTER YEAR-END ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party is
more likely to cooperate with the Kuomintang than with other
political parties after the year-end legislative election, DPP
Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks against the possibility that no single
political party would dominate the legislature after the year-end
election, which would force the ruling DPP to form a coalition
government if it wanted to get its policy implemented smoothly.</P>
      <P>The DPP currently controls less than one-third of the 220 seats
in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Wu said that he had the idea of forming a coalition government a
long time ago, adding that he believes that the KMT is the likeliest
partner for the DPP. He stressed that the gap between DPP supporters
and those of the People First Party, another opposition party, is too
big.</P>
      <P>As for the possibility of the DPP cooperating with other
political subgroups, Wu said that though it is very important for the
DPP to become a larger force in the legislature, the party must also
consider its long-term image.</P>
      <P>Wu said that some political parties have "a poor image, and a
ferocious appetite," but added that their ability to gain seats in
the legislature is certain.</P>
      <P>He dismissed the possibility of cooperation between the KMT and
PFP, saying that the KMT currently has more than 100 seats in the
legislature, and could not cooperate with the PFP if all KMT
legislators are nominated again this time.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that there is no rule of order in the nomination
processes in both the KMT and DPP, and those officials who are not
nominated could well incite infighting within their own party.</P>
      <P>As for the minor opposition New Party, Wu said its goal may be
simply to garner a minimum 5 percent of all popular votes so as to
ensure its legislator-at-large seats rather than to gain a greater
number of seats in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Wu also said the DPP will hold three seminars on the possibility
of forming a coalition government after the year-end election, with
the first to convene later this month. He said the meetings would be
held in order to consult the views of DPP heavyweights, younger DPP
members and other parties.</P>
      <P>Wu said that it is still too early to speak of political
alliances, as no one can predict the outcome of the election. There
will also be uncertainty in the two-month period between the
legislative election and the opening of the Legislative Yuan, he
said.</P>
      <P>He noted that there is still ample room for discussion on the
form and possibility of cooperation.</P>
      <P>The three seminars will be held April 29, May 5 and May 13,
respectively, and will be presided over by DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers expressed both praise and
reservations on the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ming-kao (KMT-at large) said that the U.S. plan to
sell Taiwan eight diesel-electric submarines, 12 P-3 anti-submarine
aircraft and four Kidd class destroyers will certainly upgrade
Taiwan's defensive position, especially the submarines.</P>
      <P>But he said that Taiwan should make an all-out evaluation on the
Kidd class destroyers before the decision is made to buy them, as
they are older and less sophisticated than the Aegis-equipped Arleigh
Burke-class destroyers the ROC requested.</P>
      <P>According to press reports, the United States has made the
decision to sell Taiwan the other arms.</P>
      <P>The former vice commander-in-chief of the Navy pointed out that
an assessment of the logistics, port facilities, maintenance and
capability of combat systems should be made before the government
decides to accept the U.S. offer.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Ming-hsien (DPP-Taichung City) said he was not
completely satisfied by the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Taiwan did not
need to accept the entire U.S. offer, he said.</P>
      <P>He said the Kidd class destroyer was built 20 years ago and has a
displacement of 25,000 metric tons, making it an easy target for
Beijing's military.</P>
      <P>Tsai called on government agencies concerned to reconsider the
offer before making a decision.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Secretary General to the Presidential Office Yu
Shyi-kun had no comment on the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, saying only
that the issue was still being discussed.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office is expected to make official comments
shortly, after the list of items Taiwan will buy is set.</P>

      <P>Competition at the Second Asian Physics
Olympiad kicked off Tuesday in Taipei with 81 senior high school
students from 12 countries participating.</P>
      <P>According to authorities at National Taiwan Normal University,
the event's sponsor, the regional physics competition will be divided
into theoretical and experimental categories over a four-day contest
period.</P>
      <P>The contest entries and questions, provided by 10 universities in
Taiwan and Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top research institute, are all
of doctoral standards and were recognized by the International
Physics Olympiad before being distributed to the Asian contestants,
the sponsoring authorities said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan team, which includes eight senior high school students
from around the island, was described as a highly promising contender
for at least one of the five gold medals the Second Asian Physics
Olympiad is offering, as the mainland Chinese team, which took 1st
place in a similar event last year, is absent from this year's
competition.</P>
      <P>Among the eight Taiwanese contestants, Lin Sheng-shuan, a
16-year-old from Taichung First High School, is the youngest
competitor that Taiwan has fielded in the competition for the last
seven years.</P>
      <P>Members of the Australian team are apparently more ambitious and
confident than their rivals in the current contest, claiming that
they will take at least two golds home after the competition wraps
up.</P>
      <P>The Mongolian team of three boys and three girls is probably the
most popular group in Taiwan. The Mongolian youths, dressed almost
exactly the same as boys and girls of their age in Taiwan, said they
are having wonderful experiences in Taiwan, including eating seafood
for the first time in their lives.</P>
      <P>Other participating countries are Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, Jordan, Israel and India.
Additionally, Japan and Qatar have sent observers to the event.</P>
      <P>The results of the competition will be announced Sunday. The next
Olympiad will be held in Singapore in 2002, according to National

      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian got a taste of the glory of the Academy Awards Tuesday when
he met with Ang Lee at the Oscar-winning director's home in the
southern Taiwan city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>"It's adorable," Chen said as he hugged the golden Oscar

      <P>Rubbing the gleaming Oscar statuette close to his breast, Chen

      <P>Chen said he was impressed by its moving story of honor,

relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"I adapted the dialogue `if you close your hands, you'll have
nothing; but if you open your arms, you'll have everything' into my
Lunar New Year's Eve address," Chen recalled, adding: "At that time,
I hoped mainland China could understand my message that goodwill
dialogue, not fisticuffs, can resolve cross-strait issues."</P>
      <P>Chen praised Lee as a "great promoter" of Taiwan's film industry,
saying it is particularly inspiring that Lee drew acting and
technical talent from major Chinese communities around the world,
including Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong, to form the cast and
production crew of the acclaimed film.</P>
      <P>Chen further said Lee's road to success offers the best
encouragement to local people -- "Keeping going at your ideals is the
key to success."</P>
      <P>For his part, Lee told Chen that he earnestly hopes the ROC
government can take steps to help local filmmakers "win back
audiences and create a cultural miracle."</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said he will direct the Government Information
Office, which administers Taiwan's movie industry development, to
adopt innovative measures to boost the local film industry, which has
languished for many years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COCKROACH DETERMINED TO BE MAJOR AGENT OF ALLERGIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   24  (CNA)
(By  Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The cockroach, one of the major
sensitinogens to patients prone to allergy, has been determined by
researchers at Mackay Memorial Hospital as one of the leading causes
of allergies in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The cockroach is positively the second major sensitinogen behind
the mite to allergy patients in Taiwan, particularly children.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu Shih-tah, a pediatrician at the hospital, one
out of every six children in Taiwan have been victims of cockroach
allergy.</P>
      <P>Biologists have found that eight to 13 sensitinogen agents can be
found in a single cockroach, while cockroach secretions and excreta
are the most prominent agents that cause children to suffer an
allergic rash, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Noting that one in every 10 children in Taiwan is an asthma
patient and suffers from allergies, Hsu suggested that parents keep
their households clean and cockroach-free, to lessen their children's
exposure to cockroach contamination, while continuing to reduce mite
contamination by washing bed linen in hot water and refraining from
using carpets in the home.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN  AMONG ASIAN COUNTRIES WITH LOWEST CREDIT RISK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong are
listed among Asia's newly developed countries whose banking systems
have the lowest credit risk, according to a report conducted by the
credit rating company Standard &amp; Poor's.</P>
      <P>The report, published Tuesday, classifies mainland China,
Indonesia and India as having the highest credit risk in Asia, while
the Philippines, Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia have a medium
level of credit risk.</P>
      <P>The report notes that weaker banks in Asia's newly developed
countries are less able to face the impact of regional economic
slowdown mainly because of their increasing bad loans, insufficient
capital and poor risk management systems.</P>
      <P>Ian Thompson, managing director of Standard &amp; Poor's responsible
for financial service ratings, predicted that mergers among Asian
banks will increase as the market cannot support so many banks. "The
merger is one of the steps to integrate the market," Thompson added.</P>
      <P>The report indicates that although mainland China, Indonesia and
India are all populous countries, their banking systems cannot be
compared with each other, as Indonesia's banking sector has not
recovered from the 1997 financial crisis. The global economic
slowdown has had a much more negative impact on Indonesia's banking
sector than mainland China's and India's, the report adds.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Indonesia's banking industry will need
10 years to recover.</P>
      <P>The report says Malaysia's banking sector is more capable of
facing changes. However, it warns that Malaysia's banking system
should better resolve its bad loan problem while the country is still
enjoying economic growth.</P>
      <P>As for Singapore's banking sector, Thompson described it as
well-qualified, enjoying profits and gigantic capital. He added that
the only challenge it must face is how to continue its growth in the
long run and make its operations more pluralistic.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will be offered the option
to purchase destroyers, diesel-powered submarines and anti-submarine
surveillance planes this year, according to several senior U.S.
officials.</P>
      <P>The unofficial list of the arms the United States is prepared to
offer the Republic of China is as follows:</P>
      <P>-- Four Kidd-class destroyers equipped with upgraded radar
systems. A senior White House official said that the Kidds, available
for delivery as early as 2003, would represent a "significant
upgrade" to Taiwan's navy and air defense systems;</P>
      <P>-- Eight diesel-powered submarines -- once Taiwan has the
capability of housing and operating them. Since the United States no
longer makes diesel submarines, Taiwan could choose for the United
States to arrange for the purchase through a friendly third country,
most likely a European ally, the administration officials said;</P>
      <P>-- Up to 12 P-3 Orion sub-hunting surveillance planes;</P>
      <P>-- The Palladin self-propelled artillery system;</P>

      <P>Taiwan will also be given a briefing on the PAC-3 antimissile
defense system -- an advanced version of current antimissile software
-- under development for the Pentagon. If, after the briefing, Taiwan
were to made a purchase request, the U.S. administration would
consider whether to approve the sale, a senior official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LABOR GROUP APPEALS FOR GOVERNMENT MEASURES TO HELP UNEMPLOYED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An umbrella organization of labor groups
urged the government Tuesday to address the surging unemployment amid
statistics showing 3.66 percent unemployment in the first quarter
compared with economic growth of only 3 percent for the same period.</P>
      <P>Members of the Alliance for 84 Hours for Every two Workweeks went
to the Executive Yuan Tuesday morning to urge the government to stop
the privatization of state-run enterprises and the mergers of
financial institutions, which they blamed for contributing to the
swelling jobless population.</P>
      <P>The group called for the enactment of bills curbing employers'
power to lay off workers and subjecting violators to criminal
punishment. They also called for the stabilization of public sector
employment and for the government to fix employee quotas for each
state-run company, which would have to be adhered to, irrespective of
whether or not the company actually turns a profit.</P>
      <P>Major public projects costing more than NT$200 million (US$6.25
million) should hire one-third of their workers from the jobless
worker pool, said the group.</P>
      <P>They also asked for expanding the scope of people eligible for
unemployment payments, while payment of debts owed to jobless workers
should take precedence over the payment of other debts. They also
called for the rescheduling of loans taken out by jobless workers on
the security of their houses, and the offer of interest-free loans to
jobless workers to help them pay for their children's tuition.</P>
      <P>The group urged the Executive Yuan to send back to the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) bills on trade unions, handling of labor disputes
and group work contracts, saying that the council should consult with
labor groups further to avoid any detriment to the interests of
workers.</P>
      <P>The alliance asked for the Executive Yuan's response to their
requests by May 1 -- Labor Day -- when it will organize a labor rally
and parade in Taipei to press for their requests.</P>
      <P>The surging employment rate also drew fire from opposition
lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Chin Huei-chu criticized
President Chen Shui-bian's plan to travel overseas on his first
anniversary in office as a plot to deflect public attention from his
poor performance at home.</P>
      <P>She blamed Chen for offering generous aid to Taiwan's allies on
his overseas journey despite the sagging domestic economy.</P>
      <P>Speaking tongue in cheek, she begged the government to offer "a
mite of food" to its people.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lin Kuo-lung cited party
Chairman Lien Chan as saying that situation could hardly be worse if
the government officials simply slept all day long and did nothing.</P>
      <P>Independent Legislator Chen Chin-ting blamed the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party for what he described as reneging on its
campaign promise to reduce the number of foreign laborers by 15,000
per year. Instead, Chen said, the number of foreign workers in Taiwan
increased by 30,000 in the past year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in an unrelated development, a group of technicians
and janitors working for government agencies complained to
legislators Tuesday that their pensions were reduced under the Labor
Standards Law.</P>
      <P>They claimed that the pension offered by the government before
the implementation of the Labor Standards Law in 1998 is more
generous than what is required under the new law.</P>
      <P>As a result, they further claimed, the longer they serve in their
jobs, the less pension they can claim.</P>
      <P>However, a CLA official assured them that the Labor Standards Law
provides for only the minimum pension for laborers and will not
require employers who offer better pensions to their workers to drop
their extra payments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LITTLE CHANCE OF TAIWAN JOINING WTO THIS YEAR: COA OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is seen as having little chance to
join the World Trade Organization (WTO) this year as its membership
is so closely linked to mainland China's entry, government sources
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi and Council of Agriculture
(COA) Chairman Chen Hsi-huang agreed in a meeting Tuesday that,
affected by mainland China's continual postponement of its schedule
for joining the world trade regulatory body, Taiwan's WTO entry has
been deferred year after year.</P>
      <P>Wei Ke-min, deputy director-general of the Board of Foreign
Trade, who was also present at the meeting on Taiwan's WTO admission
and related issues, said there is little chance of Taiwan becoming a
WTO member this year as a result of mainland China's deferment.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Lin seemed less pessimistic, though. He
said "little chance" is not the same as "completely hopeless," adding
that there could be a breakthrough in a WTO ministerial-level meeting
to be held in Qatar at the end of this year concerning Taiwan and
mainland China's WTO admission.</P>
      <P>COA officials said Taiwan has been told that "the time is close"
for the island to enter the WTO since 1998, when Taiwan completed
bilateral WTO talks with the United States.</P>
      <P>As WTO member countries, including the United States, have
tacitly agreed that Taiwan and mainland China should enter the WTO
almost simultaneously, albeit with Taiwan scheduled to join a little
later than the mainland, Taiwan's WTO bid has been "technically"
deferred by the WTO Secretariat since 1998, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>Against that backdrop, they added, Taiwan has been prevented from
holding its final multilateral WTO working meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin asked for cooperation and compromise from the COA
on Taiwan's bid to join the WTO, saying that in addition to the
mainland China implication, several WTO contracting members, such as
Malaysia and the Philippines, have expressed dissatisfaction with
Taiwan in regard to quarantine and quota policies on agricultural
products.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's WTO bid is not separated from mainland China's,
postponement of the issue will continue, as it is believed the
chances of the mainland entering the WTO this year are becoming
increasingly slim, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S JOBLESS RATE COULD SHOOT UP TO 4.5 PERCENT: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is "inevitable and unavoidable" that
Taiwan's unemployment rate will continue to shoot up while the
country's industrial restructuring is too slow, a local scholar
claimed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Professor Wu Chung-chi of National Taiwan University's Economics
Department said no political party or administration will be able to
stop the rising jobless rate in the face of the structural problem
that the pace of workforce structure readjustment has always lagged
behind that of the industrial structure readjustment.</P>
      <P>Wu forecast that Taiwan's unemployment rate will continue to
increase in the coming two to three years and predicted that the
island's unemployment rate will surge to a record high of 4.5 percent
this year.</P>
      <P>High unemployment as a result of changing global economic trends,
which necessitates readjustment of industrial structures, has been
the norm in Western and industrially advanced countries, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan emulate member countries of the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development in formulating
related measures to cope with high unemployment. These measures
include cancellation of the basic minimum wage, cancellation of
regulated working hours and changing of the retirement pension system
into a "personal account system."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China naval authorities are
planning to build a second facility at the Tsoying naval base that
can accommodate bigger warships, including Kidd-class and Arleigh
Burke-class destroyers, a senior naval officer said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The official, who spoke on condition of anoymity, said that the
Kidd-class destroyer is as long as the Hsuhai landing craft but 10
meters narrower than the landing craft.</P>
      <P>Seaports around Taiwan, including Suao naval port, Makung naval
port, and Kaohsiung and Keelung ports, can berth warships of this
size.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, the U.S. government has decided to
allow the sale of Kidd-class destroyers to Taiwan. The destroyers,
which have a 10-meter draught, cannot berth at Tsoying, requiring the
construction of the new facilities at the Tsoying base.</P>
      <P>In order further to expand the port's facilities, the official
said, those second-generation warships such as Lafayette-class
frigates and Knox-class destroyers -- which are currently berthed at
Tsoying -- will be deployed to other naval ports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ministry of National Defense (MND) spokesman Maj. Gen.

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The eight diesel submarines Washington
offered Tuesday to sell to Taiwan will dig deeply into the island's
pocket, according to anonymous defense officials.</P>
      <P>Although the sale will meet the island's long-held desire to
boost its sea defenses, it will cost the island about US$3 billion to
US$4 billion, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the United States no longer produces diesel
submarines, the hulls of the eight submarines will be built in
Germany in two batches of four, for assembly in the United States,
probably with General Motors Corp. as the main contractor, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>In this way, the officials, who are familiar with the arms sales,
said Bonn can sidestep its own prohibition of arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The United States will test the submarines before turning them
over to the island and will be responsible for training Taiwanese
crew to operate and maintain them, said the officials.</P>
      <P>Taiwan listed the German 209/1400 submarines in its shopping list
presented to Washington.</P>
      <P>The submarine, with a displacement of 1,150 tons and a crew of
eight officers and 27 enlisted men, is 61 meters long, 6.2 meters
wide and can cruise at a speed up to 21 knots to a range of 10,000
nautical miles.</P>
      <P>The ship can dive to 250 meters and remain underwater for 50
days, which is two to three times longer than an average traditional
submarine.</P>
      <P>Armed with eight torpedo launchers at its bow, the submarine can
fire Tigerfish torpedoes or Harpoon anti-submarine missiles.</P>
      <P>Defense officers said the submarine, currently used by dozens of
countries around the world, has earned a reputation for reliability.</P>
      <P>Taiwan already has several submarines in commission, but they are
much bigger and hard to maneuver in the Taiwan Strait, which is
basically a continental shelf between Taiwan and mainland China,

Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei last October under Mitsudo's
supervision.</P>
      <P>The surgeon said that four of the arteries fitted with supporting
devices in last October's surgery are functioning well, but another
had narrowed, requiring a coronary angioplasty surgery.</P>
      <P>He went on that a supporting device was inserted into a sixth
artery in the day's operation.</P>
      <P>Because of the new operation, Mitsudo said, Lee will have to have

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH READJUSTED DOWNWARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER) on Wednesday readjusted Taiwan's overall economic growth rate
for 2001 to 4.75 percent, about one percentage point lower than its
forecast made in January.</P>
      <P>The private economic think-tank forecast that economic
sluggishness, which is seen as prevailing in the first and second
quarters, is expected to bottom out toward the end of June, while
real growth is expected to top 5 percent or even higher in the third
and fourth quarters.</P>
      <P>More precisely, TIER researchers forecast that Taiwan's economy
will grow 3.33 percent in the first quarter, 3.91 percent in the
second quarter, 5.14 percent in the third quarter and 6.53 percent in
the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>TIER researchers predicted that the annual growth in private
spending and consumption this year will be a low 4.54 percent, mainly
as a result of the continuing plummet in the stock market which has
not only caused most investors to lose up to half of their fortunes,
but has also led to diminished spending and consumption.</P>
      <P>Private sector investment predictions are even more gloomy, with
the annual growth in this area expected to be around 2.32 percent for
2001, mainly as a result of the fact that the overall investment
environment has not improved in the short term and small- and
medium-size enterprises have found it increasingly difficult to
obtain soft loans, researchers said.</P>
      <P>In the foreign trade sector, the researchers predicted that
Taiwan's exports of commodities and services will grow 2.93 percent
for 2001, while its imports will grow 1.98 percent. Fortunately, they
forecast, the island's trade surplus will reach some NT$10 billion
(US$311 million) this year, which is expected to contribute to the
island's overall economic growth.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TIER researchers forecast that the New Taiwan dollar
will have an average rate of 32.37 against one U.S. dollar for this
year.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index is expected to be around a low 1.05
percent for the year while the wholesale price index is expected to
grow by a mere 0.75 percent, mainly as a result of economic
sluggishness, they said.</P>
      <P>In a recent survey of local manufacturers and companies on
business prospects in Taiwan, the TIER found that the index of
leading indicators, which is designed to forecast economic prospects
three to six months in advance, dropped to 91.92, representing the
seventh consecutive month to month decrease.</P>
      <P>On business prospects for the following six months (from April to
September), 31.5 percent of the companies surveyed said business will
turn for the worse, compared with 17.5 percent in a similar survey
conducted last month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 27.4 percent predicted that business prospects will
turn for the better over the next half year, a noticeable slide from
last month's 40.6 percent, the researchers said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush has
said in interviews with major news media that the United States has
an obligation to help Taiwan defend itself in case the island being
attacked by mainland China.</P>
      <P>In an interview broadcast by ABC Television in its "Good Morning
America" program Wednesday, Bush was asked if Washington had a duty
to defend the Taiwanese in the event of attack by mainland China.</P>
      <P>In response, Bush said: "Yes, we do ... and the (mainland)
Chinese must understand that. Yes, I would."</P>
      <P>Pressed on whether this mean invoking the full force of the
American military, Bush said, "Whatever it took to help Taiwan
defend itself."</P>
      <P>The interview with ABC was taped Tuesday. On the same day, Bush
also gave interviews to several other major U.S. news media,
including CBS Television, NBC Television, and the Washington Post,
as part of his efforts to brief the Americans on his major policy
directions and measures in his first 100 days in office.</P>
      <P>In all those interviews, Bush has consistently stressed that the
United States is obligated to help Taiwan defend itself under the
Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. law governing engagements with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Bush further said in those interviews that although the United
States and mainland China share many common interests, they are also
divided over some issues.</P>
      <P>"The (mainland) Chinese must understand that we've got common
interests; but there's going to be some areas where we disagree
and, evidently, one area where we disagree is whether or not the
United States ought to provide defensive arms for Taiwan, which I
have done," Bush said in an interview posted Tuesday on the
Washington Post Web site.</P>
      <P>In the interview with the Washington Post, Bush also said he
would end a near 20-year U.S. policy of annually reviewing arms
sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We have made it clear to the Taiwanese that we will not have
this so-called annual review -- that we will meet on an as needed
basis," Bush said.</P>
      <P>He also told the Washington Post that this year's arms sales
package for Taiwan is the right decision and that the United States
will keep its right to continue furnishing Taiwan with defensive
arms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOTT DESCRIBES BUSH'S DECISION ON ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN AS `PRUDENT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Senate Republican leader Trent
Lott on Tuesday described President George W. Bush's decision
regarding this year's arms sales package to Taiwan as "prudent."</P>
      <P>"This is a restrained package. I think the president has made the
right decision in view of all the considerations that were on the
table," the Mississippi Republican said.</P>
      <P>As to the Communist Chinese warning that the proposed arms sales
package is going to damage bilateral relations, Lott told reporters
after a White House budget meeting that "I think the president was
very measured in what he decided to do. China understands that we
have some agreements with Taiwan; they have a need to be able to
properly defend themselves."</P>
      <P>The senator also noted that the approved package does include the
four Kidd-class destroyers built in his home state of Mississippi,
some submarines, and other important equipment that will be helpful
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As to the Aegis destroyers that Taiwan requested to purchase but
will not get this year, Lott pointed out that the problem with the
destroyers is "it would be eight to 10 years before they could
actually be delivered."</P>
      <P>In summary, he said, "this package actually can be helpful, but I
think all things considered, the word I use once again is prudent."</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. ARMS SALE CONDUCIVE TO PEACE IN TAIWAN STRAIT: TECRO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  24 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China representative
office in Washington said Tuesday it is convinced that the U.S.
decision on this year's arms sales package to Taiwan is conducive to
peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits and constructive
cross-strait dialogue in the future.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the ROC government, the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office (TECRO) welcomed the U.S. arms sales decision
made in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 and Taiwan's
security needs.</P>
      <P>But TECRO pointed out that "military procurements are not the
only guarantee of Taiwan's security. Through constructive dialogue
and normalization of cross-strait relations, we can achieve a true
and lasting peace."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the office noted that Beijing has never been
willing to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, has continued to
put off dialogue, and has even deployed additional missiles and
forces across from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we have no choice but to acquire defensive weapons to
safeguard the lives and property of our people," it said.</P>
      <P>TECRO urged Beijing to change its ways so that the two sides can
devote the resources being used for military purposes to instead
promote stability, foster peaceful competition, and enhance
prosperity for people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>

      <P>U.S. House Republican Whip Tom Delay
said Tuesday that the president's decision to provide the most robust
arms sales package to Taiwan in over a decade "has made it crystal
clear that the United States will not allow Communist China to
dictate our foreign policy and that we are once again committed to
our democratic allies in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Senate Democratic leader Thomas Daschle, meanwhile, noted that he
has supported robust arms sales to Taiwan in the past and that he
supported this one. "I think the majority of our colleagues in my
caucus would support it as well," he said.</P>
      <P>"We recognize that there is a delicate balance between ensuring
the security of Taiwan and maintaining a good relationship with the
government of China. I think this package reflects that," Added the
South Dakota Democrat.</P>
      <P>Rep. Delay (R-Texas) pointed out in a statement in response to
President George W. Bush's arms sales package decision that "it is so
encouraging that we now have a president who understands that we can
best ensure peace through strength. As the leader of the free world,
we have a moral responsibility to stand by our democratic allies and
protect democracies."</P>
      <P>"I am further encouraged that the administration has made it
clear that other weapons requests, including the Aegis system, could
be approved in the future if Beijing continues to threaten Taiwan
with force. I look forward to working with the Bush administration to
ensure that our democratic allies in Taiwan are given the weapons and
defenses necessary to protect themselves from China," added the

    <HEADLINE>JOBLESS RATE TO PEAK IN AUGUST BEFORE DECLINING: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate is expected to
peak in August when a flood of new young graduates swamp the job
market, but the rate will not go above 4.5 percent, a top government
economic planner said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development, said that although all relevant indices
show that the island's unemployment rate had exceeded 4 percent by
mid-April, the figure for the whole of 2001 will be effectively
controlled and kept under 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the jobless rate is expected to continue to climb
in the following months and reach its apex in August with the number
of new job seekers increasing sharply beginning at the end of June.</P>
      <P>The jobless rate is expected to drop gradually after August in
line with the regular trend seen in previous years, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) voiced explicit
concerns over the country's sliding economy.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Wang Chih-kang, who was formerly economic affairs
minister, said after a KMT Central Standing Committee meeting held
Wednesday that the KMT demands that the Democratic Progressive
Party-run administration see to it that Taiwan's overall economic
growth for this year is maintained at or above 5 percent and the
unemployment rate is kept below 4 percent.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, Wang said, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and his Cabinet
should resign en masse for failing to reach these "mediocre" goals.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) made public the
figures for Taiwan's two-way trade, showing that imports in the first
three weeks of April reached US$6.87 billion, down 13.8 percent from
the same period a year earlier, while exports in the same three weeks
amounted to US$7.16 billion, down 3.9 percent.</P>
      <P>MOF officials attributed the evident decline in two-way trade
mainly to the sluggishness of world markets and also to higher
comparison bases laid last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung ordered the
formation of an inter-ministerial task force Wednesday to promote
the Republic of China's bid to join the World Health Organization
(WHO).</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Chang said the task
force should pool resources in both public and private sectors to
realize the ROC's goal of becoming a WHO full member or at least
an observer of the organization.</P>
      <P>Chang said the head of the Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH) should serve as convener of the task force and the minister
of foreign affairs as co-convener.</P>
      <P>The task force will be composed of officials from the DOH, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
Mainland Affairs Council, the Government Information Office and
the Council for Cultural Affairs, as well as private medical groups,
overseas Chinese associations and ambassadors-at-large.</P>
      <P>Chang said relevant government agencies should offer manpower
and financial support for various WHO bid-related promotional
programs.</P>
      <P>He also directed the new task force to dish out working
guidelines, detailed promotional programs and policy goals for
different phases.</P>
      <P>"The task force should supervise operations of various
promotional projects and keep close contacts with relevant private
organizations," Chang added.</P>
      <P>The premier further reminded the Mainland Affairs Council, which
charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, to include the WHO
bid-related issues into the agenda for dialogue between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly
approved a resolution Tuesday, directing Secretary of State Colin
Powell to initiate a U.S. plan to help Taiwan gain observer status
at the WHO's annual summit to be held in Geneva next month.</P>
      <P>The resolution, approved with a voice vote of 407-0, requires
Powell to endorse and help obtain observer status for Taiwan at the
upcoming WHO meeting.</P>
      <P>The resolution, initiated by Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), is
pending approval of the Senate. Once it passes the Senate floor,
the resolution will be referred to President George W. Bush for
signing into law.</P>
      <P>Once the resolution becomes law, Powell will be required to
submit a report to Congress within 14 days on how he will achieve the
observer status for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The vote came on the same day the white House announced a
package of weaponry sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Supporters of the resolution said the issue regarding Taiwan's
WHO observer status went beyond international politics, arguing that
Taiwan has made significant public health advancements and deserves
a voice in global health planning and policy.</P>
      <P>During Tuesday's House debate, Brown said Taiwan is prepared to
contribute meaningfully to the global health efforts discussed at
WHO assembly. "But without observer status, its delegates can't even

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO BECOME `COMPETITIVE COUNTRY WITH KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 25 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Wednesday that the government will take steps to develop the
island into a "competitive country with a knowledge-based economy"
within five years.</P>
      <P>He made the statement while delivering a speech at a rally in
Taipei to mark the 25th anniversary of the introduction of IC
technology into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded the achievements of the island's IC-related
industries in the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>He said that the competitiveness of a country comes from the
competitiveness of its industry and added that the semiconductor
industry is an important sector that has stimulated major investment
and promoted economic development in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Now that Taiwan has a significant share of the world's
semiconductor industry, Chen said that "the government is determined
to take long-term steps to improve the fundamental structure of the
economy with a target of developing Taiwan into a global competitive
knowledge-based country in five years."</P>
      <P>The president attributed the achievement of Taiwan's development
in the semiconductor industry mainly to the joint efforts of the
government and the industry in the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>In the past, he said, the government played an important role in
providing capital for the development and transfer of IC technology.</P>
      <P>Now, he went on, the government will focus more attention on the
creation of a better investment environment so as to help enterprises
employ new knowledge to renovate industry.</P>
      <P>At the rally, attended by nearly 200 people, former Premier Sun
Yun-suan and former Finance Minister K.T. Li were cited for their
outstanding contributions to the introduction of IC technology into

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO SAY `NO' TO U.S. SALE OF KIDD-CLASS DESTROYERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-hua of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) called for the Republic of China government
Wednesday to say "no" to the United States on its offer to sell
Taiwan four Kidd-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>Lee called a press conference at the Legislative Yuan to announce
his "12 reasons" why Taiwan should turn down the U.S. offer of
Kidd-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>Lee's reasons are:</P>
      <P>-- That the DDG-993 Kidd-class destroyer is more than 20 years
old and its structure and equipment are aged;</P>
      <P>-- That the destroyer has a displacement of 9,783 metric tons
with a draught of 10 meters, meaning it would be unable to anchor at
any of Taiwan's existing military ports;</P>
      <P>-- That with its huge size and low mobilization speed during
wartime, it would be an easy target for Beijing's forces;</P>
      <P>-- That the destroyers were designed exclusively for Iran and its
combat system is less efficient than its counterpart Spuance-class
destroyers that the U.S. Navy is currently using;</P>
      <P>-- That its special design and specifications require expensive
logistic and maintenance costs;</P>
      <P>-- That the destroyer was designed for long-haul ocean-going
combat missions, which runs counter to Taiwan's need for vessels
capable of coastal combat missions;</P>
      <P>-- That the number of personnel aboard one single Kidd-class
destroyer is around 400, making it a heavy financial burden simply in
personnel costs and related training fees;</P>
      <P>-- That its mechanical 3D radar system is less sophisticated
than the Aegis radar system of the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers,
which he claimed are the backbone of the U.S. Navy, while its air
surveillance capability is not as good as that of early-warning
surveillance aircraft;</P>
      <P>-- That its Standard II anti-aircraft missile system is not
capable of deterring missile attacks;</P>
      <P>-- That its command, control, communications and intelligence
systems are incompatible with those of the Lafayette-class frigates
which are currently in ROC Navy service;</P>
      <P>-- That the cost of NT$25 billion for four Kidd-class destroyers,
plus costs for initiation of weaponry systems and related equipment,
port reconstruction, logistics and personnel will be a mammoth
expense for the government; and</P>
      <P>-- That the United States tried twice in 1998 and 1999 to sell
the four Kidd destroyers to Greece and Australia, but were turned
down.</P>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush approved a robust arms sales
package worth more than US$4 billion to Taiwan Tuesday. The package,
the largest since 1992 -- when the U.S. government agreed to sell
Taiwan 150 F-16 jet fighters -- includes eight diesel-electric
submarines, 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and four Kidd-class
destroyers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CSBC  VOWS TO BUILD SUBMARINES FOR NAVY WITH FOREIGN COOPERATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding
Corp. (CSBC) said Wednesday it will seek cooperation with foreign
companies to win a bid to build eight diesel-powered submarines for
the Republic of China Navy.</P>
      <P>CSBC Chairman Yu Chen-nan said at a Legislative Yuan committee
meeting that the CSBC is capable of building submarines, so long as
it can acquire certain technical know-how from foreign shipbuilders.</P>
      <P>The United States has unveiled the package of weaponry systems it
has agreed to sell Taiwan this year, including eight diesel
submarines. As the United States has not manufactured any diesel
submarines for years, it may seek cooperation with a third country to
supply the submarines to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Two of the possible U.S. cooperative partners -- Germany and the
Netherlands -- have said they have no interest in cooperating with
the United States in building submarines for Taiwan, as they are
afraid such a deal would worsen their ties with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Yu told lawmakers that when the CSBC was building Perry-class
missile frigates for the ROC Navy between 1990 and 1998, the Dutch
shipbuilding company RDM sent engineers to the CSBC shipyards to
evaluate the firm's shipbuilding capacity and technological level.</P>
      <P>"At that time, RDM technicians had said the CSBC has the
capability and technical expertise to build submarines," Yu said,
adding that the CSBC will ask the Ministry of National Defense and
the navy to help it acquire technology transfers from the United
States to facilitate its bid to build the eight submarines.</P>
      <P>With experience accumulated from building more than 80 types of
military and commercial vessel, Yu said, the CSBC is confident of its
capability to build diesel submarines for the ROC Navy.</P>
      <P>The eight submarines will be armed with advanced American
weaponry systems.</P>
      <P>A CNA report from Washington, D.C. quoted a U.S. Pentagon
spokesman as saying Tuesday that the United States could facilitate a
submarine purchase by Taiwan from other nations that build such
vessels, including Germany, the Netherlands or Italy.</P>
      <P>A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, further said
this year's U.S. arms sale package for Taiwan will greatly upgrade
the ROC's naval defense capability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. ARMS SALES AIMED AT KEEPING TAIWAN STRAIT PEACE: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are mainly aimed at safeguarding peace
and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with German Parliament
(Bundestag) Deputy Speaker Hermann Otto Solms, who is currently
leading a German parliamentary delegation on a six-day visit to the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>As Solms has long staunchly supported German arms sales to
Taiwan, Chen especially mentioned in their talks a package of
weaponry systems the United States has agreed to sell the ROC this
year.</P>
      <P>The biggest prizes in the new U.S. arms sale package are eight
diesel-powered submarines that Taiwan has long wanted to buy.</P>
      <P>Chen told his guests that the submarine purchases will not only
help beef up Taiwan's underwater combat capability but will also
contribute to Taiwan Strait peace and security.</P>
      <P>Chen said he appreciates the favorable U.S. response to Taiwan's
defense needs and that he is convinced there will be room for
ROC-U.S. and ROC-Germany cooperation in "relevant fields." He did not
elaborate.</P>
      <P>The president further pointed out that the ROC's procurement of
advanced arms is purely for defensive purposes and stressed that
Taiwan also has no intention of engaging in an arms race with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>"We just want to defend our democratic way of life as well as
safeguard Taiwan Strait security and Asia-Pacific regional peace and
stability," he explained, adding: "Only when Taiwan's own security is
ensured can its 23 million people have the confidence to open the
island's doors wide for dialogue and negotiations with mainland
China."</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC has been a peace-loving country and a
peacemaker in the Asia-Pacific region, Chen said the ROC is forced to
purchase defensive weapons in the face of mainland China's sharp
increase in its defense budget and intensified military buildup and
missile deployment along its southeastern coast opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"So long as mainland China phases out its missiles targeting
Taiwan, we'll be more than willing to largely cut our military
spending and use the saved funds to improve the living quality and
environment of our people," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he feels honored to receive the 2001 Prize for
Freedom, sponsored by the London-based Liberal International, a
worldwide federation of liberal political parties.</P>
      <P>"I believe that the award marks a recognition of Taiwan's
democratic achievement," Chen said, adding that it will be an irony
if he can't freely travel to Denmark later this year to receive the
award in person simply because of Beijing's opposition. Denmark
recognizes mainland China.</P>
      <P>As Solms' party is a member of the Liberal International, Chen
asked Solms to assist in paving the way for his Denmark travel plan.</P>
      <P>For his part, Solms said he fully understands that the ROC
purchases weapons for self-defense and to maintain regional balance,
not for provocation.</P>
      <P>"As Germany endured two world wars and national division before
it finally achieved its goal of national unification, I'm fully aware
of the importance of possessing enough defensive weapons for
self-defense purposes," Solms said.</P>
      <P>Before the unification of West and East Germany, Solms said, the
two Germanys had a total of 700,000 troops. "After unification, the
number of German military servicemen has declined to 250,000," the
German parliamentarian said, adding that he hopes peace will prevail
permanently in the Taiwan Strait and other parts of the world.</P>

President Airlines are authorized to operate the service linking the
capitals of the two countries.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the agreement has not been put into practice

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Director Ang Lee had another hectic day
Wednesday in his homecoming trip, starting with a discussion with a
screenwriter of a prequel to his Oscar-winning film "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon."</P>
      <P>Lee held a three-hour meeting with screenwriter Hsia Mei-hua and
producer Hsu Li-kung on the spirit the new film should try to project
and its possible direction. Hsia said she has always admired Lee's
"ebullience" in film making and that she learned a lot from the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Asked why Lee was not collaborating again with Wang Hui-ling, who
received an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay for
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," Hsu explained that Wang is
currently working on two other films and could not find the time to
do its prequel.</P>
      <P>According to reports, the prequel will center on the two Kung Fu
masters portrayed by Hong Kong star Chow Yun-fat and Malaysian-born
Michelle Yeoh in the original film.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he was satisfied with the ending of "Crouching
Tiger" -- in which the character played by mainland up-and-coming
actress Zhang Ziyi jumps into a sea of clouds from a mountain -- and
that there will be no sequel to the film.</P>
      <P>Also that day, Lee met with Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang and later James Soong, chairman of one-year-old People
First Party.</P>
      <P>Lien presented Lee with an award for his achievement, noting that
the picture drew together film workers from Taiwan, Hong Kong and
mainland China, making the Oscar and honor for all Chinese from
Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee said that "Crouching Tiger" is a testing and trailblazing
work and that he will continue to work in the film industry.</P>
      <P>"Crouching Tiger" won four Oscars -- best cinematography, best
art direction, best original score and best foreign-language film.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of lawmakers
and volunteers from the Republic of China donated US$1 million
in cash and relief goods to India Wednesday to help victims of an
earthquake that rattled the Indian state of Gujarat Jan. 26.</P>
      <P>The relief fund and goods, including 25 ambulances, were raised
under a "With Love from Taiwan" campaign initiated by ROC Vice
President Annette Lu earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The 20-member delegation arrived in New Delhi Tuesday. Yu
Kuang-shih, leader of the group, said the mission will
travel to the earthquake-affected regions to look into what kinds of
aid the Indian people most need and the ratios of cash aid and relief
goods offered by other countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Prior to their departure, Yu said, Vice President Lu had
encouraged all mission members to show their concern and love for
Indian quake victims to signify the strength of Taiwan's soft-power
diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangement of the ROC representative office in India,
the delegation met with Indian ruling party BJP Vice Chairman
Madan Lal Khurana, and Ashok Koshy, representative of the
quake-stricken Gujarat state in New Delhi, Tuesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Legislator Parris Chang of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party told his hosts that the delegation
symbolizes the ROC people's love and concern for Indian quake
victims.</P>
      <P>"Give, care and share are the main purposes of our current
visit," said Chang, who serves as an adviser to the delegation.</P>
      <P>At least 30,000 people were killed and tens of thousands injured
in the earthquake that hit Gujarat in January.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative to India Chien Kang-tan briefed the
delegation on the current state of substantive Taiwan-Indian
relations Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chien said current ROC-Indian relations face many obstacles
due primary to India's reluctance to develop official ties with
Taiwan for fears of offending Beijing.</P>
      <P>He also outlined the ROC representative office's priority
work programs, including pushing for Taiwan-Indian direct airlinks,
signing an investment protection agreement and a temporary customs
clearance accord, as well as promoting exchanges of visits by
high-ranking officials of the two countries.</P>
      <P>After wrapping up its Gujarat visit, the delegation will
travel to the northern Indian city of Dharamsala, the seat of the
Tibetan government-in-exile. The delegation will study the
feasibility of a proposal, initiated Vice President Lu, to help the

    <HEADLINE>U.S.   FORMALLY  INFORMS  ROC  OF  ARMS  SALES DECISION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government has formally
informed a Taiwan delegation on its decision regarding arms sales to
Taiwan at the first round of an annual U.S.-ROC arms sales meeting.</P>
      <P>Pentagon Spokesman A. Quigley said the government has agreed to
offer Taiwan the option of buying four Kidd-class destroyers, eight
diesel-powered submarines and 12 P-3 anti-submarines aircraft, as
well as a range of other military equipment.</P>
      <P>Quigley described this year's arms sales as "a robust package"
aimed at upgrading Taiwan's naval combat capability.</P>
      <P>Without mentioning the price tag for the arms sales, Quigley
pointed out that Taiwan must evaluate cost, training and maintenance
elements before informing the U.S. authorities of the items and
quantities it is prepared to buy.</P>
      <P>Quigley further pointed out that the U.S. authorities will adopt
measures to resolve the problem raised by the fact that the United
States has stopped manufacturing the diesel-powered submarines which
are included in the arms sale list. He pointed out that there are a
lot of countries in the world manufacturing well-designed
diesel-powered submarines.</P>
      <P>According to military observers, the United States will not
reopen a production line for the diesel-powered submarines but might
cooperate with a third party -- probably Germany or Holland -- to
have the submarines built. The observers pointed out, however, that
Beijing would be expected to put pressure on any country
collaborating with the United States to build the submarines for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although Quigley's reluctance to elaborate on the details of the
arms sales, a well-informed source confirmed to CNA that the details
of the arms sales package are as follows:</P>
      <P>-- Four Kidd-class destroyers;</P>
      <P>-- 12 P-3 anti-submarine planes;</P>
      <P>-- Paladin self-propelled artillery system;</P>
      <P>-- MH-53E minesweeping helicopters;</P>
      <P>--AAV7A1 amphibious Assault vehicles;</P>
      <P>-- Avenger surface-to-air missile system;</P>
      <P>-- MK48 torpedoes without advanced capabilities;</P>
      <P>-- Submarine-launched and surface-launched torpedoes; and</P>
      <P>-- Aircraft survival equipment.</P>
      <P>The United States refused to sell Aegis-equipped destroyers, MIAI
tanks and Apache helicopters to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The package is the biggest one since Bush's father sold 150 F-16
jet fighters to Taiwan in 1992.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration turned down Taiwan's request to
purchase submarines over the past eight years on the grounds that
submarines are assault vessels.</P>
      <P>According to congressional sources, the Bush administrative has
clearly stated that whether or not the United States decides to sell
Aegis-equipped destroyers to Taiwan in the future will depend on the
threat Beijing's military poses to Taiwan in the next two years.</P>
      <P>Although a handful of right-wing congressmen criticized Bush's
refusal to the sell the Aegis-equipped Arleigh Burke-class destroyers
to Taiwan, the decision received praise from the vast majority in
Congress.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Wednesday that American arms sales to Taiwan are designed to
uphold the democracy of Taiwan, rather than promoting an arms race
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Meeting with Hong Kong-based novelist Chin Yung, Chen described
the arms sales package announced by the U.S. government as the
richest-ever and a new breakthrough in terms of U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the latest U.S. arms sales to Taiwan will help stabilize
the cross-Taiwan Strait situation and promote peace in the world.</P>
      <P>During their talks at the Presidential Office, Chen expressed
disagreement with Chin Yung's views over two matters.</P>
      <P>Chin Yung had remarked at a symposium at the University of
Zhejiang in October 1999 that news media should abide by the guidance
of the national government and ruling political party.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he disagreed with that view, noting that the world
has entered an era of democracy.</P>
      <P>During the 1996 missile crisis, the U.S. government dispatched
two aircraft carriers to waters adjacent to the Taiwan Strait. The
U.S. move was labeled by Chin Yung as contrary to mainland China's
unification policy, but Chen disagreed with that view as well.</P>
      <P>Despite their different opinions on these matters, the president
stressed that he still respects Chin Yung and will defend Chin Yung's
right to free speech.</P>
      <P>Chin Yung told reporters after his meeting with Chen that he had
expressed the hope that the ROC president will resolve all issues
through peaceful means. Chin Yung said that Chen fully agreed with
his suggestion and indicated that Taiwan's purchase of arms from the
United States is designed to augment Taiwan's defense capability, and
not to engage in war against mainland China. (By Victor Lai)

      <P>The association, which supervises 304 local farmers' associations
islandwide, has been plagued with rumors of vote-buying for sums as
high as NT$40 million (US$1.2 million) per vote, free vacation
give-aways and even sexual favors.</P>
      <P>In the election, carried out via secret ballot, chairman

Chao-ying, who was backed by the opposition Kuomintang, received only
nine votes.</P>
      <P>The vote for association secretary-general followed immediately,
with Huang Hsi-hsing elected.</P>
      <P>Huang, two other candidates for secretary-general, five staffers

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE PREFER LOCAL BRANDS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan people prefer local soft drink Hey
Song to Coca Cola and enjoy Taiwan beer more than Japan's Kirin's
prime brew, according to a survey by the Asian edition of the
Reader's Digest.</P>
      <P>The survey on the consumer preferences of Asian and Taiwan people
divided products into 38 categories, including cell phones,
automobiles, hotels, beverages and cosmetics, and asked those polled
to select their favorite brands based on quality, value, image,
reliability and satisfaction.</P>
      <P>Taiwan people said local brand Hey Song is their favorite soft
drink, beating out Coca Cola, the survey found. The preference for
local brands is also evident in other foodstuffs and beverages.</P>
      <P>As well as beer, Taiwan respondents also said that local tea
brands such as Tien Jen and Kaisi are as good as Lipton.</P>
      <P>Instant noodles made by Wei Lih Men and seasonal products
produced by Wei Chuan, two other local companies, are also favorites.</P>
      <P>Among airlines, China Airlines (CAL) and Eva Airways, both
Taiwan-based, received as high marks as Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
and Singapore Airlines, underscoring CAL's efforts to improve its
image.</P>
      <P>President Enterprises' products are very popular in Taiwan, with
the highest or nearly highest scores in cooking oil, seasonal
products, drinking water and instant noodles.</P>
      <P>In terms of computers, local brand Acer won recognition equal to
that of U.S. giant IBM among Taiwan users.</P>
      <P>Among cosmetics, Taiwan women like SKII and France's Guerlain for
skin care, and Shiseito and SKII for cosmetics.</P>
      <P>In electronic appliances, National refrigerators and washing
machines won recognition in Taiwan, along with Sanyo washing machines

    <HEADLINE>140,000 PEOPLE OUT OF WORK OVER PAST SIX MONTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Affected by economic sluggishness and an
84-hour bi-weekly work scheme, some 140,000 workers lost their jobs
during the period between Aug. 2000 and Feb. 2001, according to the
results of a recent survey.</P>
      <P>Conducted by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS), the survey found that average working hours among
Taiwan workers fell by 9.4 hours during the first two months of this
year as compared to the year-earlier level, while the number of
employed workers posted a sixth consecutive monthly drop.</P>
      <P>Of the 9.4 million employed workers, some 5.72 million were
working for private businesses, 950,000 were government employees and
1.48 million people owned their own businesses, according to the
survey. Of the 140,000 who lost their jobs during the six-month
period, around 139,000 were discharged by private firms, while the
number of private business owners also fell by 30,000.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the poll discovered that the average salary
increase for local workers was only 1.68 percentage points in the
first two months of the year, an historic low for the period. This is
an indication that current economic problems have resulted in
noticeable number of factory closures and employee layoffs, the DGBAS
pointed out.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that the average working hours of domestic
workers fell by 9.4 during the first two months of the year, as the
legal working hours set by the government dropped from 96 hours
every two weeks to 84 hours, the survey indicated.</P>
      <P>It found that the food-processing sector registered the largest
reduction in on-the-job hours, with workers in the industry working
an average of 12 fewer hours. That figure was followed by financial
service sector workers, who lost 9.2 working hours; and employees of
the retail, restaurant and warehouse and distribution businesses, who
worked an average of 8.9 fewer hours during the period, the survey
found.</P>

      <P>Family members of the 14 crewmen of a
Republic of China surveillance plane downed by mainland China in 1963
will travel to Jiangxi Province in early May to regain the ashes of
their beloved ones.</P>
      <P>The fate of the ROC crewmen contrasted greatly with that of the
24 crew members of a U.S. spy plane that collided in early April with
a mainland Chinese fighter and made an emergency landing on the
mainland-controlled island of Hainan. After much rhetorical jousting,
the unharmed U.S. servicemen and women were released by mainland
authorities.</P>
      <P>Chou I-li, the former leader of the ROC military's 34th squadron
-- also known as the "Black Bat Squadron" -- was the pilot of the ROC
plane that was downed 38 years ago. His son, Chou Tien, narrated the
story of the flight for reporters in his suburban Los Angeles
residence.</P>
      <P>Chou said the ill-fated P-2V plane entered mainland Chinese air
space on a nighttime surveillance mission on June 19, 1963.</P>
      <P>Eight mainland Chinese MiG fighters scrambled to chase and
intercept the spy plane, which was eventually brought down over
Linchuan in the central mainland province of Jiangxi, Chou said,
adding that his father and 13 other crew members all died in the
incident.</P>
      <P>Chou said he had never stopped searching for his father until
recently, when he found out -- 38 years after the incident -- that
the remains of the crew members had been buried in a graveyard on the
outskirts of Linchuan.</P>

decided to travel to Jiangxi Province to return the ashes of these

    <HEADLINE>ROC APPRECIATES U.S. ARMS SALES BASED ON SECURITY NEEDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China welcomes the latest
U.S. decision to sell it a package of defensive weapons based on the
provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) and its practical
security needs, the Presidential Office said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office made the remarks in a press
release. It was also the ROC's first official response to the Bush
administration's Tuesday approval of a robust arms sale package
to Taiwan, including eight diesel submarines, four Kidd-class
destroyers and 12 P-3 Orion anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>The press statement said the ROC government appreciates all the
concern shown by the U.S. government, Congress and individual people
in various social quarters for Taiwan's security and military balance
of power in the Taiwan Strait in the U.S. decision-making process.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that the U.S. decision will not only help beef up
Taiwan's defense capability and reinforce self-confidence of the
people of Taiwan but will also help maintain stability and balance of
military strength in the Taiwan Strait and contribute to future
cross-strait dialogue on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan full understands arms procurement is not the
only way to defend its national security, the statement said true
and permanent peace can be achieved only through constructive
dialogue and normalization of relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In fact, the statement said, the ROC is forced to purchase
necessary defensive weapons to meet its basic security needs and
protect its people from military threat in the face of mainland
China's refusal to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, its
intensified deployment of Taiwan-targeting missiles and its
reluctance to resume cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>"We earnestly hope that the Beijing leadership can understand
that our arms purchases and defense policies are mainly aimed at
countering mainland China' military threat," the statement said,
adding that Taiwan looks forward to seeing mainland China change its
practice, renounce the use of force, phase out all
Taiwan-targeting missiles and resume peaceful cross-strait dialogue
and consultations.</P>
      <P>The statement also reiterated the ROC's expectation that both
sides of the Taiwan Strait cut arms procurement and use the saved
funds on economic development, infrastructure construction, medical
service, education and social welfare programs.</P>
      <P>It further said the two sides should engage in peaceful
competition in political and social systems and work together to
maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and entire
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said at a weekly Cabinet
meeting that the ROC government is grateful for the U.S. decision to
sell a package of advanced defensive weapons to Taiwan in line with
the TRA and its defense requirements. The TRA is the U.S. law
governing relations with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic
ties.</P>
      <P>Chang also said the ROC will do its utmost to maintain stable
relations across the Taiwan Strait and replace conflict with
dialogue.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ROC has no intention of starting a
cross-strait arms race, Chang said the ROC's biggest desire is to
forge a stable, peaceful cross-strait relationship.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement
Wednesday, welcoming the new U.S. arms sale package to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ministry recognized the U.S. adherence to its security
commitment to the ROC.</P>
      <P>The ministry said the arms sale package will contribute to
Taiwan's defense and upgrading of local people's confidence as well
as to the maintenance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Noting that both the ROC and the United States uphold freedom,
democracy and human rights, the ministry said substantive relations
between the two countries will continue to grow in the years to
come.

TAIWAN IC INDUSTRY CELEBRATES 25TH ANNIVERSARY</P>
      <P>Taipei, April 25 (CNA) Beginning with a team of burgeoning young
talent and a shady "model factory" in the outskirts of northern
Hsinchu County in 1976, Taiwan has managed to transform itself into a
world-class IC power under its own steam.</P>
      <P>On the 25th anniversary of the introduction of IC technology into
Taiwan, industry heavyweights and elites got together Wednesday to
celebrate at the Grand Hotel.</P>
      <P>Taking part in the event were Senior Presidential Advisers Sun
Yun-suan and K. T. Li, the leading promoters of a government project
that gave birth to Taiwan's IC industry, as well as foreign
consultants and 43 members recruited by the government from both at
home and abroad at that time.</P>
      <P>Robert H.C. Tsao, board chairman of United Micro Electronics Co.,
Hu Ding-hua, manager of Macro International Corp., and Industrial
Technology Research Institute (ITRI) President Chintay Shih were
among the young techies sent by the government to "take lessons" from
the U.S.-based firm RCA 25 years ago under a special project
initiated by then-President Chiang Ching-kuo in 1974.</P>
      <P>Two years after they returned from the United States, the
government-financed ITRI finally set up a "model factory" in a
desolate location with a government subsidiary of NT$480 million in
cooperation with the new IC experts.</P>
      <P>The industry faced an unknown future 25 years ago, but Taiwan is
now the world's third-largest IC power in terms of its production
abilities, has a 13.5 percent stake in the global market, and is the
world's fourth-largest producer in terms of output value.</P>
      <P>United Micro Electronics Corp. was spun off by ITRI as the first
such high-tech firm in 1980. Starting with just NT$360 million in
capital and 36 employees, it has since developed into a major company
with capital of NT$114.7 billion (US$3.5 billion) and 9,700 workers.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, another
world-class hi-tech firm, originated from ITRI in 1987. It has also
expanded into an huge enterprise, boasting capital of NT$130 billion
(US$4 billion) and a workforce of 14,400.</P>
      <P>With a strong sense of social responsibility and an ambitious
desire to succeed, these firms have accomplished the "impossible
mission" of giving Taiwan a leading role in the world hi-tech
spectrum. In the process, they broke all the rules and shattered the
myth that developing countries should stay away from the automobile,
airplane and IC industries.</P>
      <P>The industry pioneers, most of whom were in their early 30s when
it all started but have since become grizzled and savvy industry
maestros, expressed no regrets over the path they took.</P>
      <P>Now sitting on enviable fame and huge fortunes, all the industry
pioneers who jumped into the venture so long ago had one unanimous
exclamation: "It is fantastic, and it is worthy trying."</P>
      <P>Voicing the hope that the experience of their lives will pass on
to younger generations, they jointly made a donation to set up a fund
in commemoration of the contribution made by W. Y. Pan. They said
they wanted to encourage young men to build a strong sense of
responsibility for the country at a time when it once again needs
more creative and innovative ideas in the face of fierce competition
from around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHIPOWNERS BEAR ONLY LIMITED RESPONSIBILITY IN MARINE DISPUTE: MOTC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official of the Ministry of
Transport and Communications (MOTC) said that according to
international maritime law, shipowners bear only limited
responsibility for freight that is removed from their ships.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan should pay US$1.8 million to settle the case
of the Greek freighter "Amorgos," which ran aground in waters off the
southern tip of Taiwan and spilled oil along the coast of the Kenting
area last December. The payment has invited criticism from
legislators, but MOTC Vice Minister Chang Chia-chu said that for
Taiwan to assume part of the charges is in accordance with
international norms.</P>
      <P>According to international customs, the shipowner should bear the
full responsibility of cleaning up the spilled oil but has limited
responsibility of removing the ship's cargo, which means that Taiwan
should pay part of the charges, Chang explained.</P>
      <P>The "Amorgos" incident has gone through three stages -- cleaning
up spilled oil, removing its cargo, and removing the ship itself.
This has been carried out under the jurisdiction of the Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) and the MOTC,
respectively, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that the MOTC and EPA have jointly named an
attorney to handle negotiating the issue with the lawyer of the
shipowner.</P>
      <P>During the talks, the shipowner asked Taiwan to lift a
prohibition on the return of the ship's four crewmembers and to
abolish the NT$1.5 million daily fine imposed by the government
agencies concerned, Chang said, adding that the shipowner at one
point threatened to discard the ship and cargo at the scene.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the government has lifted the exit prohibition
order for one of the four crew members on humanitarian
considerations, because he has suffered a family disaster since the
accident. If the shipowner disagrees, he should resolve the dispute
through an administrative suit, the minister added.</P>
      <P>As to the US$1.5 million charge for cleaning up the oil, the
shipowner should bear the full responsibility, Chang said. He added
that the removal of the ship and its cargo will cost US$4.3 million.</P>
      <P>After deducting the shipowner's bill of US$2.46 million, Taiwan
will still have to cover US$1.84 million, in accordance with
international customs, the minister said.</P>
      <P>However, Chang said that the shipowner should bear the full
responsibility of any compensatory damages for losses resulting from
seawater pollution caused by oil spilled from the ship. The EPA has
also asked for NT$250 million in compensation from the shipowner,
Chang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO PROVIDE MORE NEWS FROM A `THAI PERSPECTIVE': OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  April 25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Republic of China official told
local media representatives Wednesday that the ROC Government
Information Office (GIO) will strive to provide more news from "a
Thai perspective" to promote greater understanding of Taiwan here.</P>
      <P>Frederic P.N. Chang, deputy director-general of the GIO, said in
the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai that the reports will focus on
the actual living and working conditions of the 140,000-some Thai
workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that the reports will also cover the effects of
Taipei-Beijing relations on the security of the Southeast Asian
region, Taiwan's investment potential in foreign countries and other
issues related to Thailand.</P>
      <P>Chang criticized Beijing for adversely affecting regional
security through its saber-rattling at Taiwan. The choice of the 23
million people of Taiwan must be respected when determining future
Taipei-Beijing relations, he said, adding that Beijing's unilateral
explanation of the so-called "one China" principle completely
disregards Taiwan's good will.</P>
      <P>He urged the local media to report on the efforts Taiwan has made
toward better Taipei-Beijing ties with professionalism, fairness,
balance and objectivity.</P>
      <P>Economic, civil and official exchanges between Taiwan and
Thailand have not been affected despite the current lack of
diplomatic ties, Chang continued. He noted that trade officials from
the two governments often meet in international conferences, and that
the two sides have close investment, labor and tourism ties.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that Thailand is Taiwan's 12th largest trading
partner and Taiwan is Thailand's sixth largest trading partner, with
Thailand enjoying a trade surplus of US$200 million on bilateral
trade totaling US$5.3 billion last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Thailand's fourth largest foreign investor, with a
total of over US$10.3 billion invested, he said, adding that Taiwan
is also Thailand's largest export market for laborers, accounting for
43 percent of Taiwan's total foreign labor force.</P>
      <P>Also, over 550,000 Taiwan tourists visited Thailand last year,

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NOT INFORMED OF U.S. DROPPING OF ANNUAL ARMS SALES REVIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei has not been informed thus far of
any decision by Washington to drop the annual review of its requests
for arms sales, according to the Ministry of National Defense
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>U.S. President George Bush told the Washington Post in an
interview published Wednesday that his administration will scrap the
annual review of Taiwan's requests for arms and will consider the
island's defense needs whenever necessary.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense refused to
comment on the reports, saying only that Taiwan is unaware of
Washington's decision thus far.</P>
      <P>A number of Taiwan military officials were in Washington for a
regular meeting with their U.S. counterparts to discuss the ROC's
requests for arms, but a Taiwan official said that Bush's decision
was not raised on Wednesday, the last day of the meeting.</P>
      <P>However, Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, said replacing the regular review with irregular meetings
will not have any significant impact as long as Washington honors its
commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act and provides the island
with weapons necessary for its defense.</P>
      <P>Regular meetings between Taiwan and U.S. officials on arms sales
are more likely to draw attention from the international community,
not least from Beijing, and could develop into a diplomatic issue, Yu
said.</P>
      <P>However, he expressed gratitude for Bush's statement to the ABC
television network Wednesday that the United States will do whatever
it takes to help Taiwan defend itself.</P>
      <P>Arms are not the only way to guarantee peace across the Taiwan
Strait, and Taiwan has no intention of starting an arms race with
mainland China, Yu said. Rather, it will limit its arms purchases if
Beijing tones down its military intimidation, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry said Taiwan has
felt Washington's good will through the remarks of U.S. leaders.</P>
      <P>Chang Siao-yue said she would not comment on Bush's remarks until
she had looked more closely at his statement, but pointed out that
Taiwan has already felt Washington's good will toward it through the
remarks of many U.S. officials, from Secretary of State Colin Powell
on down.</P>
      <P>She denied that her unusually wary response has anything to do
with reports that Foreign Minister Tien Hong-mao has raised eyebrows
among government leaders for telling the San Jose Mercury News last
week that Taiwan would understand if its demand for four
Aegis-equipped destroyers were rejected by Washington.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to the United States Chen Chien-jen also
shied away from the issue, saying that arms sales are not within his
jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>An analyst in Washington said Bush's decision will divide the
annual arms sales package into several small sales and discussions
over the course of the year.</P>
      <P>He said the change is meant to avoid Beijing's almost certain
protest and the negative implications it brings on Washington's
already frayed ties with Beijing, not to mention the yearly meeting's
effects on the potential of an arms race between Taiwan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Irregular meetings on an as-needed basis will give Bush's
administration the leeway to consider Taiwan's defense needs at any
time, and would allow it to reconsider Taiwan's requests even
immediately after turning them down without waiting for the next
year's review.</P>
      <P>But the new measures could deprive Taiwan of the chance to raise
its defense needs to Washington's attention every spring, said the
analyst.</P>
      <P>The analyst said the annual arms sales talks were set up by the
administration of President Jimmy Carter in 1982 and are unique,
since Washington usually weighs foreign countries' requests for arms
purchases whenever it receives them.</P>
      <P>Also, the analyst said Washington's promise to offer Taiwan
European-built submarines is strategically significant, because "the

    <HEADLINE>AEC AGREES TO RESTART OPERATION OF UNIT 2 OF 3RD NUKE PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Atomic Energy Council (AEC) on
Wednesday gave the go ahead for the second unit of Taiwan's No. 3
nuclear plant to restart operations after a shutdown of more than one
month.</P>
      <P>The AEC, the nation's highest nuclear safety watchdog, ordered a
full investigation of the first unit of the nuclear power plant in
Pingtung, southern Taiwan, after a power outage at the plant caused
by the first unit. The incident was ranked 3A on a scale of four
international rankings of the danger levels of nuclear accidents --
the most severe ever to occur on the island.</P>
      <P>The AEC also shut down the second unit until the cause of the
first unit's problem is fully investigated.</P>
      <P>AEC Vice Chairman Ouyang Min-sheng said that taking into
consideration the investigation reports completed by scholars and
experts, the AEC has demanded that state-owned Taiwan Power Company,
which runs the nuclear power plant, must follow 12 safety checkup
improvement measures before the second unit can be started.</P>
      <P>Taipower has submitted a written agreement saying that whenever
there are signs of saline fog, the nuclear power plant executives
will remain vigilant against damage to the plant's components. Also,
the firm agreed that every June before the typhoon season and saline
haze season, it will arrange for two operation training drills in
complete darkness.</P>
      <P>Ouyang said that after reviewing Taipower's written report and
on-site inspection, the AEC was convinced that Taipower has indeed
completed its required improvements, and it has therefore agreed to
allow the second unit to be restarted.</P>
      <P>Ouyang said that restarting the first unit will have to await a
strict safety inspection, which may still take some time.</P>
      <P>On whether the darkness-operation training that is asked for in
the third nuclear power plant will also be expanded to the first and
second plants, in Taipei County in northern Taiwan, the AEC said that
it will ask Taipower to submit their own training programs in the
event of emergencies for AEC revisions, after which the agency will
ask the respective plants to step up training.</P>
      <P>The incident on March 18 took place when a high-tension
transmission system carrying electricity from the nuclear plant to
consumers broke down because saline fog blown inland from the nearby
sea created a short circuit across the ceramic insulators.</P>
      <P>As a result, the first and second units at the plant
automatically shut down and caused a blackout at the nuclear plant
complex.</P>
      <P>To compound the disaster, one backup diesel generator failed to
activate, while the power generated by the other could not be brought
on-line because of a burned out component.</P>
      <P>The total outage created the risk of a breakdown of the nuclear
reactor's cooling system, which can operate for only eight hours on
an emergency battery, and could have led to a nuclear accident if
electricity had not restored in time. Nuclear plant workers managed
to start a third backup generator to run the cooling system two hours
later and defused the risk.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD LEADER URGES LOCAL PEOPLE TO PUT OFF INVESTMENT IN MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan economic planner urged local
entrepreneurs Wednesday to postpone their less "urgent" investment
projects in mainland China amid the country's surging unemployment
rate.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), said Wednesday that the government has generally
approved any investment project presented by traditional industries
to invest in mainland China without screening.</P>
      <P>However, the government hopes that sectors whose investment
projects need further screening by the government can put off by "at
least one year" their "not so urgent" investment plans in mainland
China for the sake of local laborers, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen indicated that it is not a surprise that a country's jobless
rate surges when it is undergoing an adjustment in its industrial
structure. However, that process in Taiwan has coincided with a
global economic slowdown and other problems such as the shorter
workweek hours, he said.</P>
      <P>The surging unemployment rate has brought much more impact on
local people than the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted that some industries should relocate their
operations abroad to survive when their country is fully developed,
and the quicker the pace of the relocation, the cheaper the move is
for them. But the relocation spree will push other manufacturers to
follow suit, he added.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the government will coordinate with industry on the
issue and urge some industries to put off their investment plans in
mainland China, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The economic planner said the government has presented a public
construction expansion project aimed at offering more jobs to the
unemployed, which is expected to bear fruit in the second half of
this year.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the government will actively stimulate private
investment, and said some international economists have forecasted
that Taiwan's economy will improve in the fourth quarter, both of
which indicate a less serious unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>The government hopes that this year's single monthly jobless rate
will not exceed 4.5 percent and figure for the entire year will not
surpass 4 percent, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S SECURITY CRUCIAL TO REGIONAL STABILITY: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
stressed that ROC's security is crucial to the stability of the Asia
Pacific region, saying that its procurement of arms from the United
States is not only based on the consideration of its national
security, but also that of the regional stability as a whole.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks when he was interviewed by major
Italian financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, which published the
interview on half a page Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The president said his government puts national security ahead of
all other issues.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that there has never a president in the history of
Taiwan who has devoted more to the improvement of cross-strait
relation as him. Though no major result has been achieved so far, he
is not disheartened, and will continue to seek to restart
constructive dialogues with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the ROC government has no preset ideas, preset
conditions or set priorities in such talks, but only seeks that both
sides sit down to talk.</P>
      <P>Chen also pointed out that "one China" is not a question under
the ROC Constitution. But he also said that "one China" must not be
interpreted in a manner that makes Taiwan part of the People's
Republic of China or that relegates Taiwan to the status of a local
government, which would run counter to the will of the 23 million
people on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the risks Taiwan businessmen face when investing in the
mainland, the President said that all investors must assess possible
risks before making their moves.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is still a place of high uncertainty for
investors, the President said, adding that it makes promises it can
not carry out and that it has no sufficient laws and regulations to
protect investors.</P>
      <P>Il Sole 24 Ore, with a circulation of 500,000, targets mainly
people in political, economic and academic fields. The newspaper
excels in financial and economic reports, and also pays great
attention to the development of the Asian situation.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's report was based on an interview conducted April 20
by the paper's Asian Bureau Chief Luca Vinciguerra.</P>
      <P>Vinciguerra lauded Chen of the Democratic Progressive Party,
which advocated Taiwan independence in the past, as the one who dared
to challenge the five-decade rule of the Kuomintang in the
presidential election on March 18, 2000.</P>
      <P>Chen won the approval of Taiwan's people and later the election
on his platform to crack down on "black gold"-- or government's links
with the organized crime. One year in office, Chen has also defused
Beijing's threats through his wisdom and soft approach toward the
other side of Taiwan Strait, Vinciguerra said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES GERMANY TO SELL ARMS, RESUME MINISTERIAL TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   25   (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung reiterated Wednesday that the government of the Republic
of China wishes to maintain cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Chang also asked a visiting German parliamentary delegation to
push their government leaders to sell arms to Taiwan so as to upgrade
its defensive capabilities and to resume a ministerial-level
economics meeting with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks when he met with visiting German
parliamentary delegation led by Vice Speaker Herman Otto Soles at
the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Soles gave his promise to Chang that he will call on his
government to resume the Taiwan-German economic ministers' meeting
which has been interrupted for three years.</P>
      <P>Chang told his German guests that the U.S. decision to sell arms
to Taiwan will help strengthen Taiwan's defensive capability and
Asian-Pacific regional security. However, Chang stressed that the ROC
has no intention of conducting an arms race with Beijing.</P>
      <P>But faced with the large number of missiles Beijing has deployed
along its coast opposite Taiwan amid its denials that it intends to
take Taiwan by force, Taiwan is forced to purchase arms so as to
to upgrade its defensive capability, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang also stressed that the ROC will continue to make an all-out
effort to maintain cross-strait peace and stability in the
expectation that a cross-strait dialogue will resume as soon as
possible so as to resolve the disputes through negotiations rather
than confrontation. He regretted that Beijing has still refused to
resume talks with the ROC.</P>
      <P>In return, Solms said he and his colleagues understood Taiwan's
fears of Beijing's military threat, adding that he agrees that Taiwan
needs a quantity of defensive weapons. He recalled that some
officials in Germany wanted to sell arms to Taiwan 10 years ago, but
Taiwan's request was turned down by the then Christien Democratic
Party-led government.</P>
      <P>But he and his delegation colleagues supported Taiwan's request
at that time, Solms said, adding that he and his group will do
whatever they can to pursue the government to sell arms to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Solms also said that he will urge his government to resume the
meeting between the economics ministers of Taiwan and German as soon
as possible and to sign a double-taxation exemption agreement.</P>
      <P>Solms expressed his disappointment over Germany's failure to win
its Taiwan High Speed Railway construction bid, but said he was
pleased to see that China Airlines is negotiating with European firm
Airbus on a purchase agreement.</P>
      <P>Chang replied that the Taiwan High Speed Railway Company is a
private company and the government has no right to interfere with its
business. However he added that the government will continue to
encourage local industry to strengthen economic interchanges with
their German counterparts, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Klaus Buhler, one of the visiting parliamentarians,
told the ROC premier that a group amicable to Taiwan has been set up
within the German Parliament, aimed at strengthening Taiwan-German
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>More than 70 parliamentarians have joined the group, Buhler said,
also telling Chang that he told mainland leaders that they should not
assert military force as a means to resolve cross-strait issues the
last time he visited mainland China.</P>
      <P>In addition to expressing gratitude to his guests and Klaus
Rupprecht, director of German Trade Office in Taipei, for their
contributions to promoting bilateral relations between Taiwan and
Germany, Chang said he hopes the two countries will strengthen
economic, technology and cultural cooperation and exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANALYST: BUSH MAKING HIS APPROACH TO BEIJING CLEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local political analyst welcomed U.S.
President George Bush's confirmation of U.S. obligations to help
defend Taiwan as a step to avoid any misjudgments on the part of
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, former Mainland Affairs Council chairman and a researcher
at the National Policy Foundation, a Kuomintang think tank, told CNA
in an interview that Bush made his statement with an eye to
preventing Beijing from making any military move against Taiwan after
a possible miscalculation that Washington would not involve itself in
a military conflict between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Beijing's acquirement of advanced weaponry from Russia and the
freezing of ties between Taiwan and mainland China ever since
Presdient Chen Shui-bian was sworn in have contributed to the rising
tension across the Taiwan Strait, which worries Washington that a
military conflict could occur out of simple miscalculation, he said.</P>
      <P>He didn't think the mid-air collision between a U.S. spy plane
and a Beijing jet fighter had any role in Washington's decision to
sell Taiwan 12 anti-submarine airplanes and eight diesel-powered
submarines.</P>
      <P>It is more of a decision to assuage Taiwan's supporters in the
U.S. Congress than a move to retaliate against Beijing for detaining
the 24 crew members of the U.S. plane for 11 days after the
collision, said Su.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Wong Min-hsien, a professor at Tamkung University,
cautioned that Bush didn't step beyond the United States'
long-standing "one-China" policy, although he told the ABC television
channel Wednesday that he believes Washington has an obligation to
defend Taiwan and his administration will do whatever it takes to
help Taiwan to defend itself.</P>
      <P>Wong warned the public against believing that Washington will
fight Beijing to protect the island, although he said Bush's
statement is a step forward compared to his predecessor Bill Clinton.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Washington will not starve Taiwan of military
supplies as long as it is a pawn in U.S. strategy to counter
Beijing's military build-up, but added it will not go so far as to
cause military conflict over the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He lauded Taiwan's acquisition of 12 anti-submarine airplanes and
eight submarines as a breakthrough in the island's arms purchases
from the United States. But he warned that the easier it is for
Taiwan to get arms from the United States and the more heavily it
depends on Washington for arms supplies in the short term, the more
dangerous it is in the long term since it will discourage the island
from developing its own defense industry.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is likely to
make a two-night stopover in New York on his way to Latin American
and spend another two nights in Houston on his way home after
concluding his trip to that part of the world, sources with the
Presidential Office said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The sources said however that consultations are still underway
between the U.S. and Republic of China governments on President Chen
Shui-bian's transit on U.S. soil when he visits ROC allies in Central
and South America during an upcoming trip.</P>
      <P>This will be the second diplomatic overseas trip by President
Chen since he assumed power last May 20. The trip will be dubbed
"Taian Journey." He will be joined by many high-level officials.</P>
      <P>Chen is expected to leave Taiwan for his Central and South
American trip May 21 and is expected to return on the night of June 4
or the early morning of June 5. During his two-week trip, President
Chen will visit El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Honduras and
Paraguay.</P>
      <P>ROC First Lady Wu Su-chen will accompany President Chen on the

    <HEADLINE>U.S. ARMS SALES DECISION REFLECTS ROC'S DEFENSIVE NEEDS: STATE DEP'T</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 25 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. State Department on Wednesday
responded to Communist China's formal protest against this year's
arms sales package to Taiwan by saying that the U.S. decision
reflects the defensive needs of the island and that America continues
to stand firmly for a peaceful resolution to cross-strait
differences.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman Philip Reeker emphasized at a routine
press briefing that "our decision is in keeping with our obligations
under the Taiwan Relations Act and the three communiques between the
United States and China."</P>
      <P>After hearing about Communist China's formal protest the day
before, Reeker said, "we did make the point that China's own actions
have an impact on the situation in the Taiwan Strait, and we urged
that China take sensible steps to reduce tensions."</P>
      <P>He added that "we did not discuss the specifics of our arms sales
to Taiwan with those representatives of the People's Republic of
China government."</P>
      <P>Echoing the words of President George W. Bush and Secretary of
State Colin Pollen, the spokesman said that "we seek a constructive
relationship with China. And as the president has said, both the
United States and China must make a determined choice to have a
productive relationship that will contribute to a more secure, more
prosperous and more peaceful world."</P>
      <P>Regarding Bush's remarks about the U.S. readiness to defend
Taiwan if mainland China launched a military attack against the
island, Reeker pointed out that the president has said very
specifically that nothing has changed in the U.S. policy.</P>
      <P>"It hasn't changed in terms of what we have followed since 1979
with the passage of the Taiwan Relations Act," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He added that what the United States wants to see is a peaceful
resolution of cross-strait differences and issues through dialogue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen, Herman Pan and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush said
Wednesday that the United States will help Taiwan defend itself, but
he also noted that his administration strongly supports the "one
China" policy and that Taiwan independence is not part of that
policy.</P>
      <P>In a live CNN interview hours after a previous interview with
ABC's "Good Morning America" show, during which Bush said the U.S.
will do whatever it takes to help Taiwan defend itself, Bush noted
that this doesn't mean there has been a change in the United States'
"one China" policy, which governs relations with Taiwan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>"I think it is important for people to also note that my
administration strongly supports the `one China' policy, and we
expect any dispute to be resolved peacefully," Bush said.</P>
      <P>"Nothing has really changed in policy as far as I am concerned,
this is what other presidents have said and I will continue to say
so."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bush also added that "I certainly hope Taiwan adheres
to the `one China' policy and a declaration of independence is
certainly not the `one China' policy, and we will work with Taiwan to
make sure that doesn't happen."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DONATES 25 AMBULANCES TO INDIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  Delhi,  April  26  (CNA)
(By C.N. Hsieh and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's private sector donated 25
ambulances to the Indian province of Gujarat Wednesday as part of
efforts to help victims of a deadly earthquake that struck the
province in January.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony held at the Hotel Hyatt in New Delhi Wednesday
evening, Yu Kuang-shih, leader of a 20-member Taiwan delegation which
arrived in the Indian capital Tuesday, presented a cardboard
ambulance to Indian parliamentarian Dileep Sanghani, who represents
Gujarat Province, as a symbol of the donation of 25 ambulances
currently being delivered to the earthquake-stricken area.</P>
      <P>The 25 ambulances are only part of the US$1 million worth of
donations that have been raised in Taiwan in recent months under a
"With Love from Taiwan" campaign initiated by Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Of the total, US$700,000 is in the form of U.S. cash aid, while
the remainder has been used to purchase relief goods. Both the cash
and the relief goods will be brought to Gujarat Thursday by Yu and
his delegation.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan people can deeply sympathize with what the Indians have
suffered as Taiwan was also stricken by a devastating earthquake in
1999," Yu said in his address at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The US$1 million worth of donations is not actually the end of
Taiwan's compassion and empathy toward India, noted Yu, adding that a
one-year fund-raising drive will still continue in Taiwan until more
money is collected for the Indian earthquake victims.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's EVA Airways and China Airlines transported
free-of-charge other relief goods from Taiwan to Gujarat several days
ago, according to Yu.</P>
      <P>According to a World Bank report, the magnitude 7.7 earthquake
that rattled Gujarat Province Jan. 26 lasted for a lengthy 110
seconds, taking the lives of 20,086 people and injuring some 176,000
others.</P>
      <P>While Yu is leading part of the Taiwan delegation of lawmakers
and volunteers to Gujarat, where they will gain a better
understanding of the Indian people's plight and needs and will donate
stationery to elementary school children, another part of the
delegation will travel to the northern Indian city of Dharamsala
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The second group, being led by Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Parris Chang, will travel to mountainous Dharamsala, the
seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile, to study the feasibility of
a proposal, also initiated by ROC Vice President Lu, to help the
Tibetan government-in-exile build a school for children of Tibetan
exiles in that area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND TO DECIDE ON KIDD-CLASS WARSHIP DEAL IN 3 MONTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China military will make
a final decision on whether to buy four Kidd-class destroyers
offered by the United States in two to three months, a senior
Ministry of National Defense (MND) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan defense committee
meeting, MND Deputy Minister Kao Yang said the Kidd-class destroyers
were not on the ROC military's shopping list.</P>
      <P>"As the military and local society remain far divided over
whether Taiwan should buy this type of warship, we should make
a careful review, including both combat evaluation and
systematic analysis, before making a final decision," Kao told
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's arms purchases are mainly aimed at
countering mainland China's military threat, Kao said Beijing's
annual military budget has been growing at a double-digit rate in
recent years.</P>
      <P>"In contrast, our military budget has been on the decline," Kao
said, adding that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait cannot
compare in terms of tangible military force.</P>
      <P>Kao stressed that the new U.S. arms sale package to Taiwan will
contribute much to the upgrading of the ROC's overall defense
capabilities.</P>
      <P>Commenting on U.S. President George W. Bush's announcement in an
interview with the Washington Post that his administration will
scrap the once-a-year review of arms sale to Taiwan and instead meet
with Taiwan on relevant issues on an as-needed basis, Kao said the
U.S. government had discussed the issue with Taiwan in advance.</P>
      <P>"The Bush administration hopes to exercise more flexibility in
arms talks with Taiwan. They have consulted us about the issue.
Concrete alternative measures will be crafted out later," Kao said,
adding that Taiwan's arms deal dialogue channels with the United
States have been working smoothly.</P>
      <P>Kao further said arms talks on an as-needed basis will not affect
Taiwan's arms procurement or acquisition. "And we'll be pleased to
see more flexibility in U.S. arms sales to us within the
framework of the Taiwan Relations Act," he added.</P>
      <P>As for Bush's remarks made during an appearance on ABC's "Good
Morning America" show Wednesday that the United States would do
"whatever it took to help Taiwan defend herself," Kao said the ROC
appreciates the U.S. determination to maintain peace and stability
in the Taiwan Strait and the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan Strait peace is critical to Asia-Pacific
regional stability, Kao said he is convinced that all Asia-Pacific
countries would be more than willing to support any moves that could
contribute to Taiwan Strait peace and security.</P>
      <P>Kao also reminded local people that without a strong deterrent
force, Taiwan would be vulnerable to mainland China's ever growing
military threat. "Beefing up our self-defense strength is pivotal to
ensuring our national security."</P>
      <P>The United States announced earlier this week it would sell
Taiwan more than US$4 billion in new weapons, including destroyers
and submarines, in the largest arms sale to Taiwan since 1992 when
it sold the island 150 F-16 jet fighters.</P>
      <P>The U.S. announcement has drawn immediate protests from mainland
China. But Kao said the ROC military has so far detected no
unusual military movement on the other side of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD URGES LOCAL BUSINESSES TO DEFER INVESTMENT IN M'LAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top economic planner on
Thursday urged domestic businesses to defer investment in mainland
China in light of the high jobless rate in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Council of Economic Planning and
Development, said that the easing of the current "go slow, be
patient" policy toward investment in the mainland will become a
trend, but he added that in view of the high domestic jobless rate,
everyone has to think about deferring investment in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen did not point out directly which sectors Taiwan
businesspeople should defer investment in, only saying that he had
talks with members of the Taipei Computer Association last year and
that "so long as all refrain" from going, then it will do.</P>
      <P>Chen would not say if this means the government will defer easing
restrictions placed on information and other high-tech industries to
invest in the mainland.</P>
      <P>He only said that deferring investment in the mainland has to be
considered pragmatically, pointing out that traditional industries,
because of their high costs, are being forced to invest in the
mainland. But he also added that "some industries still could be
managed in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen said that there are many factors to be taken into
consideration in regards to the policy toward investment in the
mainland. If a business can defer investment in mainland China and
still maintain its competitiveness, then it should refrain from
doing so at present, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while reporting to a joint meeting of the
economic and budget committees in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen also mentioned that the jobless rate could hit a new high
this August but that the average jobless rate should not exceed four
percent for the whole of 2001.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsu Tien-tsai of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party said he is concerned that the employment of foreign laborers
could reduce the employment opportunities for local workers.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that many small- and medium- sized industry employers
can not afford the retirement payments to domestic laborers and that
as employers do not need to prepare for retirement payments for
mainland and Southeast Asian workers, they have become the
alternative to employing Taiwan laborers.</P>
      <P>Hsu urged that domestic workers be employed for major public
construction projects to decrease the unemployment rate. Chen echoed
this suggestion by saying that all public infrastructure construction
programs recently unveiled by the Executive Yuan, which have a
combined budget of more than NT$110 billion, will employ local
workers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A credit card forgery ring was broken
by law enforcement authorities in the southern port city of Kaohsiung
Thursday, marking the largest credit card crime bust in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After more than three months of investigations, Kaohsiung law
enforcement authorities raided an apartment in the city Wednesday,
nabbing seven suspects and seizing several credit card forging
machines, computers and more than 6,000 blank cards.</P>
      <P>The police said that credit card readers from two leading
department stores in Kaohsiung have reportedly been implanted with
"spy" silicon chips, enabling the counterfeiters to obtain
cardholders' codes to reproduce fake cards.</P>
      <P>Counterfeit cards were then sold to shop owners, who used them to
charge the issuing banks for phony purchases, the police said.</P>
      <P>According to tallies compiled by the five largest international
credit card companies, purchases made by using fake credit cards
amounted to NT$3 billion in Taiwan in 2000, constituting 0.41 percent
of total spending by Taiwan cardholders for the year and representing
the highest figure in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>No one is actually one hundred percent free from being a victim
of credit card fraud, the police said, pointing out that even Justice

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Thursday
encouraged the city's taxi drivers to learn English at an English
speech class held by Taipei's traffic school in Neihu, eastern Taipei
district, in order to make the city more functional for foreigners.</P>
      <P>Ma said during one of the English classes designed for Taipei's
taxi drivers that as Taipei becomes more internationalized and as
foreigners take almost one million taxi rides every year in the city,
it is important that taxi drivers be able to speak some English to
provide better service for their English-speaking passengers.</P>
      <P>The mayor remarked that the number of visitors to Taiwan has
reached a level of 2.62 million per year and that nearly 85 percent
of these visitors visit Taipei. He humorously said that it is time
"for the mayor to learn Taiwanese and the taxi drivers to learn
English".</P>
      <P>Ma also said that the coming of summer vacation will bring a lot
of foreigners to the city and that this will provide an opportunity
for the city's taxi drivers to practice their English skills with
their foreign passengers.</P>
      <P>The English speech class is available to licensed taxi drivers
who have received at least a junior high school level of education.
Classes are held twice a week for three weeks, and qualified taxi
drivers upon completion of their lessons will receive an "I Speak

    <HEADLINE>KIDD-CLASS DESTROYERS ARE POTENT, PRAGMATIC: LEGISLATORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Republic of China legislators have
voiced their support for Taiwan's purchase of four Kidd-class
destroyers from the United States, saying that they will become the
largest and most potent vessels in the country's navy.</P>
      <P>Legislators Lu Hsiu-yen of the opposition Kuomintang and Wang
Tein-ching of the People First Party said that the 172-meter long,
8,910-ton vessel, powered by four gas turbine engines, is capable
of cruising at a maximum of 33 knots.</P>
      <P>The turbine engine is of the same type used on the ROC Navy's
Cheng Kung-class vessels, which will simplify both maintenance and
logistics, Legislator Wang said. He added that the Arleigh
Burke-class destroyers that the United States decided not to sell
Taiwan also use the turbine engines.</P>
      <P>The ships are equipped with radar systems that have an effective
range of 350 kilometers and can fire four anti-aircraft missiles
simultaneously within a range of 70 kilometers, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that even if the United States decided to sell the
Aegis-equipped destroyers to Taiwan, they would not be ready for
delivery until 2010. In view of mainland China's military expansion
and purchase of modern destroyers from Russia, Taiwan must buy the
Kidd-class destroyers to maintain balance in the Taiwan Strait and
form an efficient military deterrent.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lu also said that although Kidd-class destroyers are
almost 20 years old, they still have another 20 to 30 years of
service left in them, but carry a price tag of only about one sixth
of that of a new vessel. She said the purchase will be a pragmatic
choice.</P>
      <P>The Kidd-class destroyers were originally built for use by Iran
during the reign of the Shah, but the U.S. Navy took control of the
ships in 1981 and 1982 after Iran's revolutionary Islamic regime took
power. The destroyers, currently mothballed, will be ready for
delivery by 2003.</P>
      <P>Some legislators have voiced opposition to purchasing the
Kidd-class destroyers, mainly because they are too old and too big --
making them easy targets for Beijing's military -- and that they were
designed for long-haul combat missions, which runs counter to
Taiwan's need for vessels capable of coastal combat missions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT SEES NO IMMEDIATE CROSS-STRAIT CONFLICT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Stanley Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian has said in an interview with a Hong Kong daily that he
sees no immediate possibility of a conflict erupting between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen said in the interview published in the Hong Kong Economic
Journal Thursday that under his leadership, Taiwan will never take
any provocative actions to irritate mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we'll never be a troublemaker nor will we be a
warmonger," Chen stressed, adding that self-defense is the ROC's
bottom line.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he is hopeful that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait can resume a dialogue as soon as possible to pave the way for
normalization of bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>"We believe that normalization of cross-strait ties is the
greatest guarantee of permanent peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait," said Chen, the first ROC president from the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that when he won the presidential election in March
2000, many people were worried that his election might escalate
cross-strait tension and increase the likeliness of confrontation.</P>
      <P>"But nearly one year after my inauguration, a lot of the previous
speculation and forecasts have been proved unfounded or wrong," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician said he is fully aware that
maintaining lasting peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is his
mandatory "mission, duty and responsibility."</P>
      <P>"Therefore I see no immediate possibility of a war breaking out
in the Taiwan Strait, nor do I believe that Hong Kong is likely to be
dragged into a cross-strait confrontation," Chen stressed, adding he
is convinced that safeguarding cross-strait peace will contribute to
Hong Kong's prosperity and progress.</P>
      <P>Touching on the recent U.S. approval of a robust arms sales
package to Taiwan, Chen said the ROC government and people welcome
the U.S. decision and appreciate the longtime U.S. concern for the
stability and security of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen said he thinks that the new U.S. arms sales package,
including four Kidd-class destroyers, eight diesel-powered submarines
and 12 P-3 Orion anti-submarine aircraft, will be conducive to the
balance of military power between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The sale will also be helpful to maintaining cross-strait peace
and stability as well as to the strengthening of self-confidence of
the people of Taiwan and the reopening of a cross-strait dialogue,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president further said he believes that the Bush
administration has made a wise decision based on the provisions of
the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) and Taiwan's basic defense
requirements.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said he also fully understands that Taiwan's
security cannot be solely dependent on arms procurement. "We believe
that only dialogue with mainland China and normalization of
cross-strait ties can bring peace and stability to both sides of the
Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>For the sake of self-defense, Chen went on, Taiwan has no choice
but to purchase new weaponry systems to cope with Beijing's mounting
military threat.</P>
      <P>Noting that mainland China's rising military spending and
intensified military buildup and missile deployment along its
southeastern coast opposite Taiwan pose a great threat to the ROC's
national security, Chen said arms purchases are a necessary evil.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan actually looks forward to resuming talks with
mainland China and seeing Beijing stop targeting its missiles at
Taiwan. "If that happens, our two sides can then cut our military
budgets and use the saved funds on economic development,
infrastructure construction, medical service, education and social
welfare programs."</P>
      <P>Chen also emphasized that the U.S. sale of necessary defensive
weapons to Taiwan is not aimed at encouraging a cross-strait arms
race, but at helping to safeguard Taiwan's democratic way of life and
upgrade Taiwan's self-confidence in beginning a dialogue and
negotiations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>As for the U.S. role in the cross-strait relationship, Chen said
the United States has long helped push for stable and balanced
development of relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 10,000 tons
of rice will be sent off to Liberia Friday, the first rice export
shipment to an African nation so far this year, a source at the
Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shao Yi-hsiung, director of the Kaohsiung office of southern
Taiwan's food management department under the COA, said that workers
started loading the 10,000 tons of rice onto bulk cargo freighter the
"Alam Sempurna" on April 20.</P>
      <P>After completing the loading process at noon Friday, the
freighter will carry the rice to Liberia via Vietnam, he said.</P>
      <P>Because rice is a common staple in Africa, rice exports to that
continent are part of the government's efforts to solve problems
caused by Taiwan's current rice glut, Shao said.</P>
      <P>Each year, the COA carries out a rice purchasing plan to buy a
certain quantity of rice from farmers at guaranteed prices.</P>

      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui, accompanied by his wife and a group of close aides,
returned to Taipei Thursday afternoon after winding up five days of
medical treatment in Japan.</P>
      <P>A Japan Asia Airways (JAA) plane carrying Lee arrived at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan at 2:40 p.m. Lee first
allowed an ailing Japanese passenger to de-plane, after which the
former president walked off the aircraft with a smile on his face to
meet with government officials, civic leaders and friends who had
gathered to welcome him home.</P>
      <P>President of the Legislative Yuan Wang Jin-pyng, Secretary
General of the Presidential Office Yu Shyi-kun, Vice Foreign Minister
Wu Tzu-dan, Lee's daughter Anna Lee and his son in law Lai Kuo-chou
were among those present to greet Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee had traveled to Osaka for heart treatment on April 22. At
Chuo Hospital in Kurashiki City, Okayama Prefecture, the renowned
Japanese physician Kazuaki Mitsudo performed minor heart surgery on
the former president. The same doctor had assisted doctors at
National Taiwan University Hospital when they performed a coronary
angioplasty operation on Lee last November in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Responding to news media at the airport, Lee said he feels
better, but added that he will heed his physician's advice that he
postpone his scheduled trip to visit Cornell University, his alma

      <P>Lee said that the Dr. Kazuaki Mitsudo had conducted a thorough
checkup on his heart condition, and had decided to inserted a sixth
supporter into his heart arteries after finding a problem with one of
the old supporters.</P>
      <P>Lee was undecided on whether he will go back to Japan six months
from now to have his heart checked up again, but stressed that he
would postpone his U.S. trip by one month under the recommendation of
Dr. Mitsudo.</P>

of products from three Taiwanese steel companies, which it said were
selling steel products at prices lower than their market value in the

duties of as high as 29.41 percent, while the other steel firms will
be subjected to less serious 20.28 percent duties.</P>

other countries include South Africa, Thailand, Argentina, India,
Indonesia, Holland, Romania, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Court of International Trade
is scheduled next Wednesday to deliberate on a formal complaint filed
by Taiwan-based Winbond Electronics Corp. that the U.S. Customs
Service improperly detained the company's flash memory shipments.</P>
      <P>According to documents filed with the court, Winbond is seeking a
preliminary injunction against the U.S. Customs, which claimed that
the impounded flash memory devices fall within the scope of a Limited
Exclusion Order issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission
(ITC). The ITC had ruled that any products infringing on a patent
owned by U.S.-based Atmel Corp. cannot enter the United States for
consumption.</P>
      <P>However, Winbond claimed that the chips were redesigned and did
not infringe on Atmel's U.S. patent, which it acquired from
U.S.-based Seeq Technology in 1994 and is set to expire Sept. 18 this
year.</P>
      <P>U.S.-based Silicon Storage Technologies (SST) and Japan-based
Sanyo Electric Co. have also filed separate complaints against
Customs for preventing their shipments of flash devices from entering
the United States.</P>
      <P>This was the latest development in a five-year dispute between
Atmel and the other companies. ITC investigation on the case began in
1996 and was terminated July 2, 1998 after finding no violation by
Winbond and the other companies.</P>
      <P>After Atmel filed an appeal that led to a second hearing, the
ITC's Administrative Law Judge again found in favor of Winbond and
the other defendants.</P>
      <P>However, the ITC overruled its judge last October and issued the
Limited Exclusion Order that precludes from entry into the United
States all infringing Winbond, SST and Sanyo EPROMs, EEPROMS, flash
memory, flash microcontroller semiconductor devices as well as all
circuit boards containing such semiconductor devices.</P>
      <P>The ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in February this year, cementing Atmel's victory.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has consulted the
Republic of China about more flexibility in bilateral arms trade
talks, a Ministry of National Defense (MND) spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MND military spokesman Huang Suey-sheng made the remarks after
U.S. President George W. Bush said in an interview with the
Washington Post earlier this week that his administration will scrap
the annual arms sales talks.</P>
      <P>While the United States will reserve the right to arm Taiwan,
Bush said in the interview: "We have made it clear to Taiwan that we
will not have this so-called annual review -- that we will meet on an
as-needs basis."</P>
      <P>Since 1982, ROC and U.S. officials have met annually to review
Taiwan's arms procurement plans in terms of its defense requirements
in the face of mainland China's military threat.</P>
      <P>As Beijing has consistently protested U.S. arms sales to Taiwan,
Bush indicated that his administration will try to avoid the
contentious, once-a-year showdown over arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Bush's remarks, Huang said changes in the style of
arms procurement talks will not affect Taiwan's purchase of the
defensive weapons and military equipment needed to protect its
security.</P>
      <P>Huang said the ROC recognizes the U.S. decision to exercise more
flexibility in discussing arms sales to Taiwan based on the
provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), the U.S. law governing
exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Huang said the Bush administration has consulted Taiwan about
future arms talks on an as-needed basis instead of the current
once-a-year review. Nevertheless, he went on, the two sides have yet
to craft concrete measures for future arms talks.</P>
      <P>He further stressed that current Taiwan-U.S. dialogue channels
for arms trades have been working smoothly. "We can fully exchange
views on any issue or topic," he explained.</P>
      <P>Huang also said the ROC will be pleased to see more flexibility
in arms talks within the framework of the TRA.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung police broke up a credit card
fraud gang Thursday, confiscating more than 6,000 false cards,
although 6,000 are feared to have already been circulated in the
market, the police said.</P>
      <P>The discovery is estimated to prevent possible losses of NT$1.3
million (US$39.5 million), but actual losses from counterfeit cards
already circulated will not be know until an investigation has been
carried out, the police said.</P>
      <P>The police indicated that the credit card forgery ring had tight
organization, as some members in mainland China were responsible for
making blank cards, while local people were in charge of obtaining
the secret codes of cardholders and imprinting them on the blank
cards, as well as selling the cards.</P>
      <P>Police detained seven suspects, including two department store
employees. It was found that credit card readers in at least three
department stores had special ICs inserted that could steal the
secret codes of cardholders. Further suspects are suspected of being
involved in the scam.</P>
      <P>According to estimates by the five major credit card companies in

    <DATELINE>London,  April  26 (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A British newspaper pointed out Thursday
that Taiwan has the right to self-determination and that Europe
should stand up for a democracy "constantly under pressure from an
authoritarian bully" across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Daily Telegraph editorial stressed that the Taiwan issue is
simple: "It is whether a government that oppresses its own people
should be allowed forcefully to extend that oppression to an island
that has opted for democracy and has no wish for reunification while
this yawning political gap endures."</P>
      <P>The editorial speculated that an amphibious invasion of Taiwan by
mainland China is still beyond its capabilities, but that the island
could be crippled by a naval blockade or a missile attack.</P>
      <P>The newspaper criticized Germany and Holland for having
"preemptively kowtowed to Beijing" by ruling out the possibility of
selling Taiwan the submarines that could prevent such blockades.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Financial Times charged that U.S. President George
W. Bush's statement in a television interview Wednesday that America
would do "whatever it took" to help Taiwan defend herself was
"needless provocation."</P>
      <P>The paper warned that the main casualty of any "bad atmospherics"
between Beijing and Washington over Taiwan would be invariably Taiwan
itself.</P>
      <P>It urged Bush to clarify his views by reiterating key U.S.
principles on Taiwan policy, including the acceptance of the "one
China" policy and support for the peaceful unification of Taiwan and
mainland China, should that accord with the wishes of the island's
people.</P>
      <P>Washington should also provide sufficient arms to Taiwan for the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S IT HARDWARE OUTPUT DOWN IN FIRST QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The hardware production of Taiwan's
information technology (IT) industry in the first quarter of this
year registered negative growth in both value and volume, the
Institute for Information Industry (III) revealed Thursday.</P>
      <P>III statistics show that this was the first time a quarterly
negative growth has been posted in the hardware production of the
island's IT industry over the past decade.</P>
      <P>The statistics indicate that IT hardware production in the
January-March period totaled US$8.58 billion, down 10.1 percent
against the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>The production of notebook computers went down 18.1 percent and
5.9 percent, respectively, in terms of value and volume.</P>
      <P>Production of monitors decreased 15.1 percent and 11.4 percent,
respectively, in value and volume, while that of desk-top computers
dropped 11.1 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>III analysts predicted that owing to global market sluggishness,
the production of Taiwan's IT industry this year is likely to
experience "stagnation" or "negative growth."</P>
      <P>They said that the output of Taiwan's notebook computers this
year may decrease 6.6 percent in value against last year and that the
2001 growth in value may go down 6.4 percent for monitors and 3.3
percent for desk-top computers.</P>
      <P>The prediction for 2001 is extremely contrary to an III

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition People First Party (PFP)
legislator said Thursday that her party is working on a bill that
would help the nation's worsening unemployment problem by preventing
large numbers of workers from being laid off without warning.</P>
      <P>Shen Chih-hwei said at a press conference that a recent Economics
Ministry report, which was not disclosed to the public, listed as
many as 56,020 firms that went out of business last year, a 6.33
percent increase over the previous year.</P>
      <P>She went on to say that the 5,302 registered factory closures
last year are another factor leading to the current unemployment
high.</P>
      <P>Shen urged the Cabinet to quickly come up with related bills to
complement her party's proposed draft law.</P>
      <P>Chiu Yi, a scholar who helped the PFP write the bill, said that
the current draft calls for companies that seek to lay off more than
10 workers to provide a written proposal 60 days in advance. If the
company then violates any rules or agreed-upon clauses, it could be
punished in a variety of ways, he added.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the possibility of foreign workers cutting into
local jobs, Shen said that the foreign worker population currently
stands at 327,000, which is rapidly approaching the nation's number
of unemployed workers at 358,000.</P>
      <P>A official of the Council of Labor Affairs who attended the press
conference claimed that the number of foreign workers in Taiwan in
the manufacturing industry is actually on a decline of approximately
5 percent to 6 percent annually.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the demand for foreign workers in the home
care sector remains high, requiring further full-scale discussions
with the Interior Ministry and other government agencies.</P>
      <P>The official added that the key to the serious unemployment
problem is finding ways to promote domestic investment willingness.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local aviation official said Thursday
that Taiwan's aviation authorities will brace for a demand from
Singapore Airlines (SIA) to share the liability for a crash that
occurred last year at Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek International Airport.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-cheng, deputy director-general of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) refused to comment on wire service reports that
SIA will seek to name the CAA as a party to any litigation filed
against SIA by the families of victims or survivors of the Oct. 31
crash.</P>
      <P>Chang said it is too early to apportion the liability for the
crash, as an investigation into the accident is still under way.</P>
      <P>However, his administration will respond to any lawsuit brought
against it, said Chang.</P>
      <P>A total of 83 passengers aboard the Boeing 747-400 were killed in
the accident which took place during a typhoon.</P>
      <P>Some 80 suits have already been filed against the carrier in Los
Angeles, the destination of the ill-fated airplane, although
US$400,000 compensation for each victim was offered by SIA.</P>
      <P>A preliminary investigation into the accident by the Taiwan
authorities found that the pilot tried to take off from a runway
closed for repair and crashed into concrete blocks and construction
machinery left lying on the tarmac.</P>
      <P>Although the airport blamed the pilot for turning onto the wrong
runway, the airline suggested that the airport shared responsibility
because the runway was lit for use and not properly closed off,
causing the pilot to mistake it for the runway assigned to his plane.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
the key to easing tensions and stabilizing relations across the
Taiwan Strait is for both sides to reopen negotiations, stressing
that the "cross-strait dialogue must be resumed."</P>
      <P>Chen said maintaining steady and peaceful relations with mainland
China has been a top mission of his administration since he took
office last May, adding that he will continue to make strenuous
efforts to accelerate cross-strait ties based on the concept of
"outperforming steely power with willowy softness."</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while paying a visit to Li
Yuan-zu, former vice president and incumbent senior presidential
adviser, at Li's residence in Miaoli County, northern Taiwan. The
visit coincidentally took place on the eighth anniversary of landmark
talks between top Taiwan negotiator Koo Chen-fu and his mainland
counterpart Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation, met with Wang, chairman of Beijing's intermediary body,
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, in Singapore
on April 29, 1993, marking groundbreaking talks between the rival
sides following a nearly five-decade hiatus in formal relations.</P>
      <P>Chen paid a half-hour courtesy call at Li's residence, offering
his personal greetings to the former vice president and exchanging
views with him on a wide range of topics.</P>
      <P>Li lauded Chen as a pragmatic statesman who can easily perceive
and identify problems. Noting that it always requires a certain
period of time before the performance of any new president or
administration bears fruit, Li urged Chen to make the stabilizing of
domestic politics and cross-strait relations his top priorities.</P>
      <P>Li also noted that the government's administrative policies
should be forward-thinking in outlook and should allow all levels of
government equal financial opportunities and access.</P>

      <P>An official of the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) suggested Saturday that both sides of the
Taiwan Strait emulate the European spirit of seeking peaceful and
common development in order to help solve the cross-Taiwan Strait
political stalemate.</P>
      <P>Citing the European Union experience as an example, SEF Deputy
Secretary-General Yen Wan-chin said that before Taiwan and mainland
China integrate, neither side should insist on preconditions nor
exert its own opinions on the other side.</P>
      <P>In a symposium on the topic of seeing cross-strait relations
through the European Union experience, Yen said that six European
states grouped together in 1951 to form the Coal and Steel Community,
which gradually evolved into the European Common Market and then
today's European Union.</P>
      <P>The European experience of integration provides invaluable
inspiration to both sides of the Taiwan Strait in their reunification
efforts, Yen said.</P>
      <P>Stressing the importance of building "rules of the game" between
the two sides before the integration process begins, Yen suggested
that both sides refrain from making demands or setting preconditions

    <HEADLINE>SENATOR SAYS U.S. POLICY TOWARD CHINA REMAINS BASICALLY UNCHANGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Senator Craig Thomas told an
influential group of Chinese Americans Friday that he believes U.S.
policy toward mainland China remains basically unchanged despite
recent events that have strained bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a luncheon session of the 10th annual conference of
the Committee of 100, a New York-based organization of Chinese
American leaders in various fields, the chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee's East Asian and Pacific Affairs
Subcommittee said that he believes the U.S. administration will
continue to adhere to a "one China" policy, the "three communiques"
and the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>He added that U.S. President George W. Bush's recent statement
that America would do "whatever it took" to help Taiwan defend itself
was a "message" for Beijing in the wake of the manner in which
mainland China "tested" the U.S. administration through its handling
of the April 1 incident involving a mid-air collision between a U.S.
Navy reconnaissance plane and a mainland jet fighter.</P>
      <P>Thomas said that Beijing's handling of the incident has led him
and many of his congressional colleagues to trust mainland China even
less because of the way it raised doubts as to whether it will follow
appropriate international standards in handling related affairs.</P>
      <P>He added that the incident has also made him and other Congress
members re-examine whether the United States should provide even more
weapons to Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>However, Thomas stressed that he advocates candid and public
dialogue with Beijing on various issues instead of attempts to
isolate or contain mainland China. He also said that he does not
believe Washington-Beijing relations will continue to deteriorate.</P>
      <P>In response to a question raised after his speech, Thomas
stressed that the U.S. Congress is not "anti-Chinese" as many
mainland students seem to believe.</P>
      <P>He said that the United States supports a democratic Taiwan but
that it will also try to ensure that the island does not take on any
courses of action that will escalate tensions in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added that the United States will also promote a
strengthening of trade and investment relations between Taiwan and
mainland China and urge the two sides to resolve their differences
peacefully through dialogue.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian
reiterated Saturday that the proposed controversial Meinung Reservoir
in southern Taiwan will not be constructed during his presidency.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge while attending the opening of a Meinung
Hakka Cultural Artifacts Museum. Residents of the area have been
vehemently opposed to plans to build the dam due to the effects the
dam would impart on the region's concentrated Hakka population.</P>
      <P>The previous administration planned to construct a reservoir to
pre-empt possible future water shortages for the region's growing
industrial zones and to deal with concerns that water for the greater
Kaohsiung region is drawn from polluted downstream Kaoping River
sources.</P>
      <P>However, Chen announced last August during a visit to the area
that the dam will not be constructed and that alternative solutions
will be offered to resolve the issues of polluted drinking water and
possible future water shortages in the region.</P>
      <P>Addressing Meinung Township residents again Saturday, Chen said
that the government treats Hakka affairs seriously and that the
establishment of a Executive Yuan committee to specifically handle
such affairs was ratified by the Legislature last week.</P>
      <P>Because Hakka residents make up approximately 15 percent of the
island's population, Chen noted, the strengthening of Hakka language
education is a direction to strive for.</P>
      <P>During the day, Chen also attended the centennial anniversary
celebration of Kaohsiung County's Lin Yuan Elementary School, the
largest primary school in the county.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the government is promoting the incorporation of

    <HEADLINE>DETERRENCE NAME OF THE GAME IN TAIPEI-BEIJING RELATIONS: DAILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  27  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Deterrence is the name of the game in
Taipei-Beijing relations, a Canadian newspaper commented Friday
following the apparent heightening of tensions between Washington and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Montreal Gazette said Taiwan has an interest in deterring
Beijing from trying to reunite it with the mainland by force or the
threat of force, Beijing has an interest in deterring the island from
declaring independence, and Washington has an interest in deterring
mainland China from doing the former and Taiwan from doing the
latter.</P>
      <P>Based on this premise, the article praised Washington for having
"wisely turned down Taiwan's request to buy" destroyers equipped with
the Aegis battle management system, at least for the time being.</P>
      <P>In addition to approving the sale of a long list of military
hardware, including submarines, patrol planes and Kidd-class
destroyers, U.S. President George W. Bush gave something even more
valuable to Taiwan, the Gazette said.</P>
      <P>"He made the clearest statement in recent history of Washington's
readiness to come to Taiwan's aid if it is attacked by the People's
Republic of China," it said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs a credible deterrent force to dissuade Beijing from
trying to reunite the island with the mainland by force. That is in
Washington's interest too, because the U.S. would just as soon not
have to face a war against the nuclear-armed mainland China, the
daily said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, neither Washington nor Beijing wants Taiwan to
feel invulnerable, lest it declare independence, it added.</P>
      <P>In short, Taiwan is a prime example of a situation that should be
left as it is, even if the situation does seem a little bizarre, the
Gazette said.</P>
      <P>The editorial explained that most of the world adheres to the
notion that legally there is only one China, whose capital is in
Beijing, while at the same time, in many practical ways, Taiwan acts
as if it were an independent country and is widely treated as such.</P>
      <P>"Washington is right to try to steer the middle course," - that
is, to try to avoid any changes to the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait, it concluded.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior U.S. trade official said
Friday that although Taiwan has made progress in the protection of
intellectual property rights over the past several weeks, "it is far
from satisfactory."</P>
      <P>The official, who asked not to be named, said that "we want to
see a fully effective optical media law that addresses our concern."</P>
      <P>He claimed that the version of the optical media management
statute being drafted by the Republic of China's Executive Yuan with
added provisions for criminal responsibility is "ineffective."</P>
      <P>He added that the U.S. Trade Representative Office has completed
preparations of its annual list of countries that it believes require
close monitoring and that could be subject to trade sanctions under
the Special 301 provisions of the 1989 U.S. Omnibus Trade Act if they
fail to address U.S. concerns.</P>
      <P>The list will be announced Monday, the official added, hinting
that Taiwan may be included in the "priority watch list" this year as
many have speculated.</P>
      <P>The official said that the United States is very concerned about
the seriousness of the compact disc piracy issue in Taiwan. He
claimed that Taiwan's pirated CDs have even been sold in markets as
far away as Brazil.</P>
      <P>He cited the case of Digicode Technologies, a Taiwan-based
company that he said was caught three times for allegedly selling
pirated CDs.</P>
      <P>On another issue of concern for U.S. trade officials, he
reiterated that Taiwan should make its patent laws conform with World
Trade Organization (WTO) standards.</P>
      <P>Taiwan trade officials agreed in March to extend the maximum term
of local patents issued prior to 1994 from 18 years to 20 years, but
only after Taiwan is allowed to enter the WTO.</P>
      <P>Patents issued in Taiwan since 1994 have followed the uniform
20-year term prescribed by the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, the precursor to the WTO.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office is intentionally
keeping Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian's forthcoming
Latin American trip low profile, aiming to avoid provoking Beijing, a
Presidential Office source said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In order not to jab at Beijing's hyper-sensitive nerves,
especially so soon after the collision between a U.S. Navy
reconnaissance plane and a mainland jetfighter and also the U.S.
decision to sell a hefty volume of weaponry to Taiwan, the
Presidential Office has tried to keep low-key on the itinerary of
Chen's stopover in the United States, said Deputy Presidential
Secretary-General Eugene Chien.</P>
      <P>Against this background, which coincidentally also includes a
scheduled visit by former ROC President Lee Teng-hui to the United
States in late May, Chien, who has been in charge of arranging Chen's
overseas trip, said Taipei is allowing U.S. authorities to decide on
the agenda and related affairs when Chen and his entourage make a
stopover in the United States on their way to and from Central
America and South America between May 21 and June 4.</P>
      <P>According to the preliminary schedule, Chen is likely to make a
two-night stopover in New York on his way to Latin America and spend
another two nights in Houston on his way home after concluding his
trip to that part of the world.</P>
      <P>During the stopover in New York, Chen is expected to be met by
several members of the U.S. Congress and to visit the Metropolitan
Museum, Chien said.</P>
      <P>Topping the itinerary of the forthcoming trip to five countries
in Central America and South America is a state visit May 23 to El
Salvador where he will attend a leadership summit of eight Central
American heads of state, Chien noted.</P>
      <P>The trip, the second of its kind since Chen took office last May,

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of former RCA Co. workers
announced Saturday that they are lodging a cross-border lawsuit
against the U.S. company and asking for compensation for employees
who worked at RCA's Taoyuan plant and later developed cancer or other
fatal diseases.</P>
      <P>The ex-RCA workers, accompanied by Independent Legislator Shih
Ming-teh and several lawyers, held a press conference at the
Legislative Yuan to appeal for aid for their plight which has lasted
since 1992.</P>
      <P>According to the petitioners, a total of 1,059 former RCA workers
have suffered from various kinds of serious diseases, including liver
cancer and stomach cancer. Of them, 216 have died from cancer over
the past several years.</P>
      <P>RCA first set up production lines in the northern Taiwan county
of Taoyuan in 1970 to produce television sets and other electronic
home appliances.</P>
      <P>The ex-RCA workers have claimed that the company continued
digging wells near the Taoyuan plant for 20 years to store its toxic
waste up until the time it shutdown its Taiwan operations in 1992.</P>
      <P>The soil and artesian well water in the adjacent area became so
seriously polluted that the Republic of China Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration formally declared the site of
the former RCA factory a "permanently toxic" area in February 1998.</P>
      <P>Many former RCA workers developed various forms of cancer or
other diseases due to long-term exposure to the polluted environment,
including contaminated drinking water, at the factory, the
petitioners said.</P>
      <P>The former RCA workers appealed on March 30 to the Taipei office
of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which represents U.S.
interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>The AIT however initially shut its doors and refused to receive
the petitioners. Security guards at the institute later agreed to
help transfer the petition letter to relevant AIT officials.</P>
      <P>According to the ex-RCA workers, the former Kuomintang government
had organized an ad hoc group under the Executive Yuan, aiming at
examining the occupational hazard case and related legal issues.</P>
      <P>The ad hoc group, unfortunately, was disbanded by the new

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local scholars said Saturday at a seminar
on Taipei-Beijing relations that the European Union model could not
be easily applied to the case of Taiwan and mainland China as a means
of "integration."</P>
      <P>Despite repeated suggestions by Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian that bilateral relations could follow the model of E.U.
integration in the future, the scholars noted that the ideological
gap between the people on the opposite sides of the Taiwan Strait are
simply too great.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) law professor Wang Tai-chuan
said that Beijing's insistence on "one China" and its denial of the
fact that the Republic of China is a sovereign nation make any
attempt to pursue stable economic and political development under the
E.U. model "difficult" for both sides.</P>
      <P>With such widely different economic structures, mainstream
values, and beliefs in human rights, Wang said that the E.U. model is
not transplantable. The results of an integration under this model
would probably not conform with the Taiwan people's interests, he
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ko Tse-tung, a member of the Examination Yuan who once
served as director of the NTU Law Institute, noted that E.U. members
began with multilateral exchanges in such areas as trade, tariffs,
currency and capital, and arrived at an economic integration before
working toward political integration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT RECRUITMENT OF FILIPINO WORKERS TO BE IMPLEMENTED FROM MAY 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will
announce measures May 1 on the direct recruitment of Filipino workers
for the manufacturing and construction industries, to be implemented
immediately, CLA sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that Filipino workers recruited to work in Taiwan
without going through a labor broker will pay only NT$35,000 to apply
to work in Taiwan, a significant two-thirds decrease from the amount
spent through brokerage companies.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said the CLA and the Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration (POEA) have reached consensus on the recruitment and
labor condition contracts for the manufacturing and construction
sectors.</P>
      <P>The POEA has finally agreed that whether Taiwan employers must
pay Filipino workers accommodation and food supplements will be
decided through an agreement between the employers and workers
themselves.</P>
      <P>As for the direct recruitment of Filipinos to work as caregivers
for Taiwan families, the CLA is inclined to follow the Labor Standard
Law to set upper limits for daily work hours, vacations and salaries,
which will be set forth in labor contracts.</P>
      <P>However, the CLA will not announce and implement the direct
recruitment of Filipino caregivers until Aug. 1 because the CLA and
the POEA have yet to complete negotiations on labor contracts in this
category.</P>
      <P>The CLA officials were keen to point out, however, that even if
the government makes an all-out implementation of the system from
Aug. 1, it will not be a substitute for the current brokerage system.
Instead, according to the officials, the government will allow the
two systems to run concurrently, giving employers more choice in
their hiring policies.</P>
      <P>According to an operation flow chart agreed upon by the two
nations, Taiwan employers must submit to the POEA a brief company
introduction, a detailed explanation of manpower needs and a copy of
the labor contract, as well as an approval certificate from the CLA
and the planned date of recruitment.</P>
      <P>The Philippine Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei will then
check on the qualifications of the Taiwan employer and if he passes
the screening, the POEA will take the first step of recruiting in the
Philippines according to the employer's manpower needs.</P>
      <P>The POEA will select workers from its own database, or through
Philippine public employment service organizations and provide their
data to the Taiwan employers, who will select the workers they want
to recruit.</P>
      <P>The Philippine government will arrange a physical examination for
the recruited workers and also organize job seminars so that the new
recruits will know what to expect in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After this, the Filipino workers will have to prepare all visa
documents, while the Philippine Economic and Cultural Office in
Taipei will inform the Taiwan employers of the arrival date of the
new recruits, so that they can arrange their accommodation and meet
them at the airport.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said the new rules will further promote the
relationship between Taiwan and the Philippines.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) delegation led by the party's secretary-general, Wu Nai-jen,
headed to Kinmen on Saturday to evaluate firsthand the results so far
of the "three mini links" implemented unilaterally by the Republic of
China government Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Standing Committee on April 10 approved the
setting up of an ad hoc committee on the "three mini links,"
referring to direct trade, shipping, and postal links between the
ROC-held islands of Matzu and Kinmen and selected ports in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Kao said that visits between Xiamen and Kinmen and between Mawei
and Matzu have been frequent since the implementation of the "three
mini-links." He added that both sides have set up a formula for
exchanges.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the administration has an obligation to find
out the local people's feelings concerning the "three mini links" and
its effects so that they can be used as a reference by government
authorities when mapping out the "big three links."</P>
      <P>Wu and his entourage called on the Kinmen Chapter of the DPP
where they were briefed on the Kinmen situation.</P>
      <P>After holding a symposium with Kinmen County officials, including
Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tzai and officials from the Kinmen
Fishery Association and the Kinmen Farmers' Association, Wu stressed
that the DPP-led government will build Kinmen into an economically
prosperous island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA FACING CHALLENGES WITH WTO ENTRY (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 29 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the spotlight has recently been
on the aftermath of the spat over a U.S. surveillance plane and its
midair collision with a Chinese F-8 fighter, U.S. business leaders
are looking beyond the incident and to China's future entry into the
WTO.</P>
      <P>In September of 2000, the U.S. Senate approved permanent normal
trading relations with China by a vote of 83 to 15. Previously, the
granting to China of most-favored-nation status, now called normal
trading relations, was tied to a large extent to its record on human
rights. Many feel that Beijing has not earned this preferential
trading position.</P>
      <P>Many say that China has not made improvements in respecting the
rights of the individual to be granted an improved place in economic
relations with the United States.</P>
      <P>Of course, arguments to the contrary have been made: that China
has, in fact, improved its record on human rights. That dialogue with
China is the best way to steer them toward becoming a democratic
country and that opening China to U.S. trade is in the national
interest of the United States.</P>
      <P>Some U.S. politicians say China must be admonished for its
reluctance to return the crew members of the damaged U.S.
surveillance plane, but official foreign policy statements say that
the situation revolving around the incident will not include
unrelated issues, such as arms sales to Taiwan. Businessmen are just
as keen to see what is clearly a political and diplomatic problem
stay well removed from impacting international trade issues.</P>
      <P>That China will be admitted to the WTO is a foregone conclusion,
but what is less clear is whether China is up to the challenges and
obligations that member states must accept.</P>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush said on May 17, 2000 that "economic
freedom creates habits of liberty. And habits of liberty create
expectations of democracy. Trade with China serves our own national
interest, as well as the security interests of China's neighbors.
China is not our 'strategic partner.' But neither is it our enemy.
When both China and Taiwan are members of the WTO, both will need to
apply global rules to their trade, including trade with one another,
and the prospects for cross-strait relations should improve."</P>
      <P>President Bush's view may be correct with regard to China, but
what about Taiwan? Is there something missing within a 'normal
relations' framework regarding Taiwan? Relations between China and
Taiwan could improve after both are admitted to the WTO, but as long
as the U.S. treats democratic Taiwan as the poor cousin to China, it
will be difficult for the trilateral relationship to be based on
equality.</P>
      <P>But let's look at the issue of China's place in the WTO more
closely. Although China is assured of admittance to the world trade
body, Beijing still has much to do to satisfy the requirements as a
member. More importantly, being a member of the WTO may be a
double-edged sword for China: while entry should help the economy of
the country, the changes that must ensue could well rock the
foundations that Beijing has held so dear for so long. Foundations
such as authoritarian rule, lax enforcement of law, rampant
corruption throughout government and control over the workforce. The
current consensus among WTO members is that Taiwan and China should
be admitted at the same time, and although Taiwan has already
finalized bilateral and multilateral negotiations, it must wait for
China to complete all the necessary procedures.</P>
      <P>According to Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Donald M.
Phillip, China has made important concessions in intellectual
property rights protection and service market opening and
transparency during the working party's 14th meeting, which concluded
on Dec. 8, 2000. However, according to Phillip, China has still
failed to reach agreement with major WTO members on many sensitive
issues, including farm produce subsidies, service trade and
anti-dumping measures. As a result, WTO entry for both sides of the
Taiwan Strait will be delayed with some wondering if entry might not
even come before the end of the year. (More)</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA FACING CHALLENGES WITH WTO ENTRY  (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 29 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has been dragging its feet on complying with certain terms
with WTO members. European Union officials have complained of China's
backsliding in the issuance of licenses to liberalize the insurance
market and although China said that it would allow foreign firms into
its mobile phone market, it has suggested that the best way to do
this would be for the firms to work with one of China's three
state-owned telecom enterprises.</P>
      <P>None of this should come as a surprise to those who have always
looked at China as a country unaccustomed to fair play and unfamiliar
with international cooperation. It may be difficult for China to
follow through with its promises and this raises serious questions
about its ability to effectively enforce its obligations to the WTO.</P>
      <P>One problem is the dealings between provinces in China. Although
goods are supposed to be freely traded across provincial borders,
this is not always the case. It is hard to see how China can
effectively guarantee the free flow of goods and services into and
around the country when it has trouble with its own commerce.</P>
      <P>Local officials must also play a role in the new economic
landscape after WTO entry. Cronyism and kickbacks will have a ripple
effect that provincial administrators have never had to deal with
before. And central government leaders will have their hands full
"re-educating" officials on doing business without bribes or
"facilitation money."</P>
      <P>And what is to be done to police China's operations within the
WTO framework? Beijing has done virtually nothing to address the
concerns of the U.S. and other Western nations to begin an overhaul
of their judicial system. How will businesses be able to redress
grievances against their Chinese counterparts? Professionals may find
that just because you can do business with China does not always mean
that it is wise to do so.</P>
      <P>Membership in the WTO is not supposed to have political
implications. China is well aware of this when it suits their
purpose. When observers point out China's dismal record on human
rights, Beijing says that the WTO is concerned with business and
human rights is an internal matter for China and has nothing to do
with anyone or anything else. Suppression of religious choice, as in
the continuing crackdown on practitioners of Falun Gong, should not
be considered along with WTO entry.</P>
      <P>But should any country speak positively about Taiwan's
sovereignty, Beijing falls all over itself to link the politics of
cross-strait affairs with the WTO.</P>
      <P>Part of the heart of the WTO is its avoidance of ambiguity --
something that China may have trouble understanding.</P>
      <P>Another issue to watch from China is how the workforce deals with
the changes that WTO entry will bring. Increasing competition from
outside China and the pressure on state-owned companies to perform at
levels many of them are not prepared for will test the resolve of the
management structure and, perhaps, the patience of workers.</P>
      <P>It is certain that officials in Beijing have mulled over the
possibility of workers going on strike and how to address such
disturbances. One of the major challenges in the near future will be
for Beijing to contain any flare-ups by displaced or disgruntled
groups. In this case, the causes will not be student movements in
Tiananamen or a wall dedicated to democracy -- it will be the
economic disruption of a worker-class dependent on working within
established and familiar frameworks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's entry into the WTO will also necessitate that it face
the reality of keener competition, but Taiwan's government, economic
and legal infrastructure is far advanced of that in China. Taiwan has
much experience with international dealings -- from agricultural
products to the highest cutting-edge technology imports and exports.
Although Taiwan has not been a member of the WTO, it has developed a
worldwide reputation for quality and dependability. In the last
decade, Taiwan has liberalized its trade system, lowered tariffs and
has improved protection of intellectual property rights to the level
of other developed nations.</P>
      <P>WTO membership will bring benefits to Taiwan, and may also for
China, but Beijing will face unprecedented challenges to the way it
has previously controlled the country. Whether or not China will rise
above and follow the rules remains to be seen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAYOR MA TO BE ABSENT FROM ASIA-PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Just days before the opening in Hawaii of
the Second Mayors' Asia Pacific Environmental Summit, Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou has decided not to attend the meeting as previously
scheduled, Taipei City Government sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ma changed his mind on attending the gathering of more than 100
mayors from 29 countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region after
being notified by the organizers that he would not be allowed to
deliver a speech during the meeting.</P>
      <P>The summit, to be held May 4-6 in Honolulu, will be jointly
sponsored by the Asian Development Bank and the U.S. Agency for
International Development.</P>
      <P>Ma had originally planned to take part in the summit and deliver
a speech on Taipei City's new garbage collection system, which has
since won applause locally and internationally since he put it into
force last year.</P>
      <P>The organizers of the summit reportedly asked Ma to make an
appearance but not to make a speech in the meeting due to pressure
from Beijing. The first Mayors' Asia Pacific Environmental Summit was
held in Hawaii on Jan. 31, 1999.</P>
      <P>However, the sources said that Ma will fly to Seattle, Washington
to attend the Third Asia-Pacific City Summit on May 6-8.</P>
      <P>During that summit, Ma will give a speech on Taipei's attempt to
transform itself into a Web-based city. Ma will also take the
opportunity to woo foreign investment in a newly opened software
industrial zone in Taipei's Nankang District.</P>
      <P>Ma and his predecessor, former Taipei Mayor and now Republic of
China President Chen Shui-bian, took part in the last two Asia
Pacific City's Summits in Brisbane, Australia.</P>
      <P>In addition to Ma, Deputy Kaohsiung City Mayor Lin Yung-chien and
Tainan County Magistrate Chen Tang-shan will also attend the Seattle
summit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAS SLOWED DOWN UNDER NEW ADMINISTRATION: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic activity in Taiwan is slowing
down significantly under President Chen Shui-bian's administration,
said an opposition lawmaker Sunday. The criticism comes amid reports
that the nation's unemployment rate surged to a record high of 4
percent, or 380,000 people, in April.</P>
      <P>Leg. Lai Shih-pao of the New Party said at a press conference
called to unveil his plan to counter the swelling number of jobless
people, Lai said that with one year in office, President Chen's
administration has seen the economy slide and the unemployment rate
surge.</P>
      <P>He said the rising unemployment rate is a result of the sagging
economic activity by private firms, gauged by 18 criteria.</P>
      <P>Notable indicators of weakening economic activity are:</P>
      <P>--the number of newly-established firms under the new
administration is 480 less per month than under the previous
administration;</P>
      <P>-- the number of business folding under the new administration is
233 more per month than that under the previous administration;</P>
      <P>-- compared with the figures of the previous administration, the
industrial growth index is 1.84 points less per month while business'
inventory index has increased by 10.5 points per month, mainly
because of a slowdown in sales;</P>
      <P>-- government revenues from business taxes have decreased from an
average of NT$20.8 billion (US$650 million) to NT$17.5 billion
(US$546 million) per month;</P>
      <P>-- loans extended by financial institutions to private firms has
been pared by 2.07 percent per month;</P>
      <P>-- the number of rubber checks drawn by businesses has increased
by 0.06 percent per month; and</P>
      <P>-- the growth of private investment is 5.81 percent less per
month under the new administration than that of the previous
administration.</P>
      <P>In order to address the problem, he urged the government to cut
down on the number of foreign workers brought to the island.</P>
      <P>The number of foreign workers, standing at more than 325,000 in
April, is 23,000 more than that under the previous government and has
contributed to the increasing jobless population, Lai said.</P>
      <P>He also announced the launch of a non-profit business consultancy
on his personal website with the aim of helping local businesses
weather the hardship.</P>
      <P>The economist-turned lawmaker said he has lined up more than a
hundred business administration experts to answer questions facing
local businesses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIRBUS TRYING HARD TO LURE TAIWAN AIRLINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the good performance of its aircraft
in Taiwan's market over the past 20 years, Airbus Industrie is
working actively to lure more orders for its superjumbo jet A380 from
Taiwan's airlines.</P>
      <P>According to sources from China Airlines (CAL), the company
maintains a "positive view" on the aircraft, which was just
introduced to the market late last year.</P>
      <P>During her visit to Toulouse, France to witness the delivery of
an Airbus A340-300 jetliner April 27, a high-level CAL executive was
a major target of Airbus promotion of the A380.</P>
      <P>Airbus considers Taiwanese airlines to be potential customers, as
evidenced by the firm's previous consultations with two of the
island's airlines when it was designing the jumbo jet, which will be
able to accommodate 555 passengers on two decks.</P>
      <P>Relations between Airbus and Taiwan dates back to 20 years ago,
when CAL first bought A300 aircraft from the firm.</P>
      <P>CAL was satisfied with the performance of the airplanes and
decided to buy A300-600 aircraft in 1988, adding eight A340 orders in
1999.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's EVA Airways became an Airbus customer earlier this year,
when it ordered eight A330-200s to replace its aging B767s.</P>
      <P>During the delivery ceremony for the A340-300, the CAL executive
described the A380 as a excellent aircraft designed for real needs,
and hinted that her company might buy the aircraft in the future.</P>
      <P>Airbus has already received orders for 62 A380s from eight air
carriers worldwide, with Singapore Airlines the only airline in Asia
to have placed such an order. The first A380 is scheduled to be
delivered in 2006.</P>
      <P>With its 20-year effort in the Taiwan market, Airbus has plenty
of confidence that it will eventually sell the A380 to Taiwan's
airlines, according to John Leahy, Airbus executive vice president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S SON TO BE INDUCTED INTO MILITARY  IN JUNE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's son, who sang
that he wanted to be a soldier in one of Chen's campaign commercials,
will finally get his wish when he is inducted into the military to
answer a draft call in July, a local newspaper reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News said Chen Chih-chung, the only son of Chen
Shui-bian, will graduate from National Taiwan University this spring,
and has chosen to enter Taiwan's 20-month mandatory military service
before continuing with his studies, although he would be eligible for
deferment if he were accepted by any graduate school.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung has already passed a screening to serve as a
military legal clerk, and his parents reportedly prefer that he
perform his military service before continuing on with his studies.
The younger Chen's conscription will also help reassure people that
his father's campaign promise that he would not seek war with Beijing
still holds true.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Hwang Hui-sheng was reported as saying that
the president's son will be treated the same as any other conscript,
and will not be given special treatment.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung appeared in one commercial during his father's
presidential campaign in 2000, during which he sang that he wanted to
be a soldier. The advertisement was aimed at scuttling the claims of
his father's political rivals that a victory for Chen Shui-bian in
the election would put the island on the path of military conflict
with Beijing because of his pro-independence stance.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian's campaign used the commercial featuring his son
to emphasize that he would carefully steer the island away from war,
since his son was scheduled to serve in the army soon.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung's induction might also ease the criticism of his
would-be brother-in-law Chao Chien-ming, whose planned engagement
in June with the president's only daughter recently came to light.</P>
      <P>Chao, a doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital, has drawn
fire from critics of the president since they found the apparently
healthy young man was exempted from military service for medical
reasons.</P>
      <P>Current law requires all Taiwanese men who have reached 18 years
of age and have finished their studies to serve in the military for
22 months. However, the system has been charged with favoring the
middle and upper classes, because an unusually large proportion of
politicians' sons have been exempted from it.
 Draft-dodging is especially rampant among medical school
students, who know how to take advantage of medical exemption
loopholes in the law. According to one estimate, about one third of
male medical students never serve in the military.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu suggested Sunday
that a tiny island off the coast of southern Taiwan be developed into
a resort for the country's increasing population of senior citizens.</P>
      <P>In an event marking the upcoming Mother's Day, Lu suggested the
government to turn Pingtung County's barren islet of Hsiaoliuchiu
into an exclusive resort for pensioners, or a "longevity island."</P>
      <P>It would also boost the islet's faltering economy and enhance the
lives of Hsialiuchiu's dwellers, said Lu.</P>
      <P>The country's first woman vice president met with 21 female
centenarians at an event held in their honor at a local hotel Sunday.
She presented bouquets to each of them and wished them a happy
Mother's Day.</P>
      <P>Lu's suggestion was welcomed by Tsai Chia-chiang, Hsiaoliuchiu's
administrator. He said any proposal which might create jobs on the
islet would be accepted with pleasure by the local people.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Hsiaoliuchiu, located west of the Pingtung County
coast, has suffered a mass exodus of residents because of the
scarcity of jobs there. Many of the island's former dwellers have
moved to Taiwan proper to seek better lives, and only 12,000 people
live on the islet now, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Party lawmaker Elmer Fung announced
Sunday that he will lead a group of more than 30 retired generals and
military experts on a visit to mainland China in June, in a bid to
dissolve tension and create a mechanism for military trust between
both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference he called at the Legislative Yuan,
Fung said that he will head the group of former generals, military
experts and academics in accordance with government rules.</P>
      <P>He added that they will leave for mainland China June 3 at the
invitation of relevant mainland Chinese military authorities through
the arrangements of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>During their stay, Fung said they will hold seminars with local
military units in Beijing and Nanjing and meet with Beijing officials
to exchange opinions on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Accusing the United States of purposely sparking tension between
Taiwan and mainland China under the pretext that its weapons sales to
Taiwan are aimed at helping the island counter attacks from the
mainland, he urged the government led by pro-independence President
Chen Shui-bian to recognize that "Taiwanese are Chinese" as soon as
possible. "Chinese people don't fight Chinese people," he added.</P>
      <P>According to the lawmaker with the pro-unification New Party, the
purpose of the U.S. decision to sell Taiwan four "like-destroyer"
Kidd-class vessels is to form a small battle group to cut down on
risks in the deployment of U.S. aircraft carriers.</P>
      <P>Fung said although the new U.S. strategy to "lure Taiwan to shift
to an offshore defensive policy" seems to enable the Republic of
China to increase its combat abilities, he contended that it will
actually "escalate tension" and "block the unification" between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that it would result in a "nobody-wins situation"
for both Taiwan and mainland China, in order to ensure the U.S.
status as the sole world power.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ranking officials of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), the ROC's highest government agency in charge
of Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, said that they have not
seen any application for such a mainland trip by Fung and stressed
that all moves must be in compliance with government rules.</P>
      <P>Regarding the definition of the so-called "retired military
generals," the MAC officials said they will study relevant government
rules in order to gain an understanding of whether they are viewed as
"ordinary retired government officials." Such officials are subject
to certain limitations regarding visits to the mainland.</P>
      <P>If necessary, the MAC will ask relevant government organizations
to give an explanation on the status of any retired military general
who wishes to pay a visit to the mainland on the tour organized by
Fung.</P>

      <P>Despite the spat over the construction of
the fourth nuclear power plant and the stalemate between the ruling
and opposition parties in the Legislative Yuan, President Chen
Shui-bian's approval rating has rebounded, a recent survey has found.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the survey on the performance of
Chen, who will celebrate his first anniversary as the head of state
of the Republic of China on May 20, some 57 percent of respondents
expressed satisfaction with Chen's performance, an increase from
previous levels that fell as below 40 percent. Just 27 percent voiced
a lack of satisfaction with Chen's performance in the latest poll.</P>
      <P>Of the people who are contented with Chen's performance, 7.4
percent said they are "very satisfied," while 49.8 percent said they
are "satisfied."</P>
      <P>At the same time, as many as 76 percent of respondents said they
are unsatisfied with the performance of the Legislative Yuan, and
more than 60 percent of them agree with a proposal to cut the number
of legislative seats by half, the survey discovered. Only around 10
percent said they are satisfied with the lawmakers' performance.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lin Cho-shui of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
said that he is ashamed of the low public approval rating for
parliamentarians. He pointed out that this is an indication that
legislative reforms are a pressing issue.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chen Horng-chi of the largest opposition party, the
Kuomintang (KMT), said that public discontent with legislators will
be reflected in the legislative election slated for December, which
he said is a warning to his party that it must field qualified
candidates in the year-end contest as a means of reform.</P>
      <P>In face of mainland China's efforts to block Taiwan's presence in
the international community, more than 50 percent of Taiwan residents
believe that a recent medical trip to Japan by former President Lee
Teng-hui and his planned visit to the United States will help improve
Taiwan's diplomatic position, while 20 percent are of the opposite
opinion.</P>
      <P>As to Chen's forthcoming visit to the ROC's diplomatic allies in
Central America and his two unofficial stopovers in the U.S., around
65 percent of the Taiwan people contend that the trip will help
Taiwan diplomatically, while 15 percent said they don't think so.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey was conducted April 24-26, and 1,075 valid

    <HEADLINE>LU URGES TAIWANESE LETTER CAMPAIGN TO ASK BEIJING TO DISMANTLE MISSILES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu asked local people Sunday to write to mainland Chinese leader
Jiang Zemin in order to urge him to dismantle the missiles Beijing
has deployed along its southeastern coast.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while attending a ceremony in celebration of
Buddha's birthday organized by the International Fukuan Association
at the National College of Physical Education and Sports in Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>More than 20,000 Buddhists attended the activity in which
Buddha's image was bathed, including some high-ranking government
officials such as Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Examination Yuan
President Hsu Shui-teh.</P>
      <P>In her speech after the rite, Lu said she knows that many people
have been upset recently by changes in their jobs or lives, but that
these things are normal in any person's lifetime.</P>
      <P>She suggested that people learn modesty during fruitful times,
and how to endure the pain when hardship attacks them.</P>
      <P>Lu urged people to show more concern to the unemployed, and asked
the wealthy to show mercy toward those less privileged.</P>
      <P>Changing her topic to cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Lu urged the
leaders of mainland China to stop deploying missiles with Taiwan as
their apparent target, and instead use the money to care for the
mainland's needy.</P>
      <P>The vice president then called on local people to write to Jiang
Zemin on Aug. 14, the anniversary of the last day of the Second World
War, asking him to dismantle the missiles aimed at Taiwan quickly in
order to create a better environment between the two sides of the
strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT  HEAD  CALLS FOR PEACEFUL COMPETITION BETWEEN TAIPEI AND BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The root of the dispute between Taiwan and
mainland China lies in the differences in their political
institutions rather than a struggle for national reunification or
Taiwan independence, Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a statement marking the 10th anniversary of the end of "the
period of national mobilization for the suppression of communist
rebellion" -- otherwise known as martial law -- Lien stressed the
good will underlying the erstwhile KMT government's far-reaching move
to no longer consider the authorities in Beijing rebels against KMT
rule.</P>
      <P>Lien said the daring step taken by the KMT-led government 10
years ago had led to peaceful economic and cultural exchanges between
Taiwan and mainland China over the past decade as well as a series of
measures to promote bilateral talks.</P>
      <P>He lamented that the process started by the KMT was disrupted
after 1999, saying that a new impasse had emerged after the DPP took
presidential power because of its refusal to bow to Beijing's demand
that "one China" be used as the principle of negotiations between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>Lien called on Beijing and Taipei to return to their 1992
consensus on "one China with separate definitions" and start engaging
in peaceful competition.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing should be more sympathetic of the feelings of
people in Taiwan and stop its attempts to isolate the island
diplomatically. He then urged Taiwan's ruling DPP to give up what he
called its insistence on the pursuit of Taiwan independence and shift
its policy toward the middle of the road.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT HAILED FOR CRACKDOWN ON 'BLACK GOLD'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent survey has revealed that the
Taiwan people praise the current administration led by the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) for its efforts to eradicate corruption, but
complain that it lags far behind the public's expectations on
reviving the local economy.</P>
      <P>According to the poll carried out April 24-26, 62 percent of
respondents said they are satisfied with the government's performance
in its efforts to clamp down on the so-called "black gold" --
referring to corruption involving the government with vested
interests. At the same time, as many as 72 percent showed agreement
with the idea of setting up an "anti-corruption" government agency.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that only 19.3 percent of Taiwan's people are
"satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the government's performance,
while 66 percent voiced their "dissatisfaction" or "extreme
dissatisfaction," as the present DPP-led administration is to mark
its first anniversary on May 20.</P>
      <P>Regarding the economic sluggishness which is sweeping most local
businesses, some 30 percent attributed the situation to an ongoing
economic slowdown in the global market, ahead of 27 percent who
blamed inadequate government policy and 15 percent who pointed to the
political boycott from the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>As to the legislative election planned for the end of this year,
around 23 percent said they have a philosophy similar to that of the
DPP, some 20 percent said they hold the same viewpoints as the People
First Party, and 10 percent identified themselves with the
Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, about 63 percent of the Taiwan people think that U.S.
sales of advanced weapons to Taiwan will help safeguard the island's
security, in contrast to some 20 percent who view the U.S. arms sales
of destroyers or submarines as "not very helpful" or "very
unhelpful."</P>
      <P>On the foreign and mainland affairs policies adopted by the
DPP-led administration, an equal percentage of the public -- 38
percent -- voiced "satisfaction" and "dissatisfaction," respectively,
according to the survey.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPORTED PRICE HIKE PLAN BY TAIWAN RAIL MAY HIT SNAG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A price hike plan that has reportedly been
proposed by the state-run Taiwan Railway Administration may hit a
snag before it becomes a policy, sources from the Legislative Yuan
said Monday.</P>
      <P>During a Transportation and Communications Committee hearing in
the Legislative Yuan on Monday, legislators from among the major
parties unanimously opposed an alleged plan by Taiwan Railway to
raise its ticket prices from 15 percent to 50 percent depending on
the class of the ticket.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the legislative committee hearing,
Transportation and Communications Minister Yeh Chu-lan said she
thinks it is not appropriate at this time for Taiwan Railway to
launch an across-the-board price hike as the gap between the services
now provided by Taiwan's sole railroad company and passengers'
expectations is still wide.</P>
      <P>Yeh denied that the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) is holding a closed-door meeting Monday to discuss Taiwan
Railway's price hike plan. She did note that Taiwan Railway's
management has recently begun discussing a price hike plan but added
that the plan is only in the draft stage and is still far from
becoming policy.</P>
      <P>She stressed that the MOTC will place the safety of the railway
system and the quality of the system's services as the top priorities
when assessing the feasibility of a price hike plan if the company
puts forth such a plan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Tuo of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
said there is no way that he will approve a price hike at a time when
Taiwan Railway has just reported a spate of accidents and persistent
and serious schedule delays as well as has demonstrated poor crisis
management abilities.</P>
      <P>Wang said he is opposed to a Taiwan Railway price hike before the
quality of the company's services is improved.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung of the People First Party said 90
percent of Taiwan Railway's customers are students, salary men, or
female office workers. A price hike at a time when the nation's
economy is slumping would only drive away the company's regular
customers and would be counterproductive to achieving the company's
goal of raising more money, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan Railway regularly suffers annual losses of
about NT$10 billion, Kuomintang Legislator Chen Ching-pao said he is
not against Taiwan Railway's plan to raise ticket prices, but he
urged the company to reevaluate such a hike before coming to a
decision.</P>
      <P>Chen warned that an across-the-board price hike might spook
Taiwan Railway's regular customers, who he said have incomes that are
not that high, thereby causing greater losses for the company.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The tiny opposition New Party announced
its decision Monday to nominate three candidates for the year-end
parliamentary elections in metropolitan Taipei's northern
electoral district.</P>
      <P>The party's nomination committee said at a press conference that
it has decided to nominate former Legislators Yok Mu-ming and Kao
Hui-yu and incumbent Taipei City Council Deputy Speaker Fei Hung-tai
to run for legislative seats in the northern Taipei constituency.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the pro-unification party also nominated
three standard bearers to run in the southern Taipei district
parliamentary elections -- incumbent Legislators Lai Shyh-bao and
Elmer Feng and Taipei City Councilor Chin Li-fang.</P>
      <P>Nearly all New Party heavyweights, including the convener and
deputy convener of the party's nomination committee, Hsu Li-nung and
Wang Chien-hsien, as well as convener of the party's national
campaign and development committee Hsieh Chi-ta, were present at the
news conference to introduce the three candidates for the
northern Taipei constituency.</P>
      <P>New Party convener Hsieh, herself a legislator, said all the
party's three nominees for the northern Taipei district have their
own working styles and support bases, the party has thus decided to
nominate them.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said all New Party members and supporters are working
hard to ensure that the party garners at least 5 percent of the
vote cast in regional legislative elections to qualify for securing
at-large seats in the parliament.</P>
      <P>"We have full confidence in realizing our goal," Hsieh said,
adding she is convinced that all of the six New Party candidates for
the Taipei regional legislative elections will be able to win their
electoral bids.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Yok said with Taiwan's economy
mired in the doldrums, the New Party should focus its campaign
strategy more on economic issues than on political topics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S DECISION MAY BE EFFORT TO EASE U.S.-PRC TENSIONS: CBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  29  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said
Sunday that Beijing's decision to allow American officials to take a
look at the U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane being held on Hainan
Island in southern China could be seen as an effort to ease tensions
in U.S.-mainland China bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The CBC quoted the official mainland Chinese news agency Xinhua
as reporting that Beijing has decided to let the officials inspect
the aircraft which made an emergency landing at a military airport on
Hainan Island after colliding with a Chinese jet fighter.</P>
      <P>Xinhua said the U.S. has agreed to make a payment to mainland
China in the wake of the April 1 collision between the U.S. plane and
the mainland Chinese jet fighter, whose pilot is still missing and
presumed dead.</P>
      <P>There will be more negotiations on the specific amount of the
U.S. payment and what exactly the payment will be for, according to
the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LABOR AND TRADE UNIONS TO LAUNCH LARGEST-EVER RALLY MAY 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two leading domestic labor and trade union</P>
      <P>groups are scheduled to launch the largest-ever Labor Day rally
in Taiwan Tuesday, taking the plight of local workers to the streets,
labor sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>More than 10,000 blue-collar workers are expected to join the
Labor Day rally to transmit their view that "laborers need a chance
to survive and all sectors in society should have equal
opportunities," said Huang Ching-hsien, chairman of the Taiwan
Confederation of Trade Unions, the sponsor of Tuesday's rally.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the demonstrations will highlight such issues
as accelerating the privatization of state-run enterprises, allowing
blue-collar workers the opportunity to be elected to the board of
directors of state-run enterprises, and demanding that the Council of
Labor Affairs be made to give a clear explanation of the government's
shortened workweek policy.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators will also approach the Ministry of Education,
asking the government to grant subsidies to children of unemployed
workers on the same standards that it now grants subsidies to
children of teachers, military personnel and public functionaries.</P>
      <P>Members of the Bank Employees' Confederation will appeal to the
Ministry of Finance for an explicit guarantee of their work rights
after several government-guided mergers take effect, according to
Huang.</P>
      <P>Workers of the Confederation of Welfare for the Elderly will ask
the Legislative Yuan for quick legislation to allow the initiation of
the national annuity program as soon as possible, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Lin Hui-kuan, chairman of the Chinese Federation of Labor,
another group sponsoring Tuesday's demonstration, noted at a
Legislative Yuan hearing that the Labor Day rally is aimed at
enabling the people in power to hear the voices of Taiwan's laborers.</P>
      <P>Lin said laborers and blue-collar workers have been the major
victims of the past year's economic slump and added that he sincerely
hopes that next year's Labor Day will not be as miserable for
Taiwan's laborers as this year's.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition Kuomintang, said
he feels sadness for the nation's laborers, particularly on the eve
of Labor Day, a day designated to mark the significance of workers'
contribution to society.</P>
      <P>Citing that Taiwan's unemployment rate reached an unprecedented
high of 3.8 percent in March and the figure is expected to shoot up
to 4 percent for the entire year of 2001, Lien called for the
Democratic Progressive Party-ruled government to show some guts and
ability and to help laborers and low-income people secure work
opportunities amid the nationwide economic slump.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chou Po-lun, Democratic Progressive Party whip in the
Legislative Yuan, called for members of the labor and trade union
groups not to be "used" by a few people for their political gain.
"The DPP is always with the laborers," he stressed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's automobile manufacturers asked
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Monday to provide effective
assistance for them to tide over the pressing difficulties their
industry is now facing.</P>
      <P>They presented their request while meeting with Economics
Minister Lin Hsin-yi and other MOEA officials at a symposium.</P>
      <P>Participants noted that sales of automobiles on the Taiwan market
have sharply declined over the past few years, down from 570,000
vehicles in 1994 to 420,000 vehicles last year.</P>
      <P>They described the present economic stagnation as another heavy
blow to the local auto makers following the devastating Sept. 21
earthquake of 1999, and expressed the hope that the government will
provide long-term low-interest loans for the industry.</P>
      <P>Some executives also asked the government to provide incentives
for automobile development and help them establish subsidiaries in
foreign countries, as well as adjust the "go slow, be patient" policy
to enable them to make investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>In response, MOEA officials said that Taiwan has already signed
investment protection agreements with Malaysia, the Philippines and
Thailand.</P>
      <P>Regarding investment in the mainland, they pointed out that
readjustment of the "go slow, be patient" policy must be decided
through negotiations with other government agencies.</P>
      <P>Participants at the symposium included executives from Yulon
Motor, China Motor, Kuozui Motors, Ford Lio Ho Motor, San Yang

    <TEXT>
      <P>In an effort to relieve Taiwan's shortage
of foreign service workers, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
has been promoting diplomatic service as an alternative to compulsory
military service.</P>
      <P>Initially, some 35 conscripts will travel overseas to engage in
technical and medical service for Taiwan's allies as an alternative
to serving in the military, with the first screening of candidates
beginning on April 11 and ending Monday. Before they are dispatched
overseas, the selected men will receive five weeks of military
training starting this July and undergo three months of technical and
language training beginning in September.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue expressed her gratitude for the
young men who have shown interest in the foreign service, saying that
the diplomatic alternative to compulsory military service is an
effective utilization of human resources and an important part of the
Republic of China's diplomacy.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the program has been one of MOFA's six
major administrative focuses of this year, and the MOFA and the
Ministry of the Interior cooperated to establish the alternative
program's regulations, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in the face of widespread bickering over controversial
issues such as military service term management, eligibility and
qualifications, Chang said that the MOFA will consult with related
government agencies before making its final decisions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said Monday that it has no knowledge of any secret visit to Taiwan by
Dennis Blair, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, early
this month.</P>
      <P>"There is no record showing that Admiral Blair visited Taiwan
recently," said an MND official who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official was responding to a media report that Blair made a
one-day secret visit to Taiwan nearly three weeks ago.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Republic of China and the United States have long
maintained close military exchanges, the official said exchanges of
visits by their senior officers are "nothing unusual."</P>
      <P>"Out of concern of protests and boycotts by mainland China, those
visits have traditionally been kept secret," the official explained.
"However, there is in fact no record showing that Blair recently
visited Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The official went on to say that the U.S. military usually
invites the commander-in-chief of a branch of the ROC armed forces to
visit the United States each year.</P>
      <P>"And in return, we have also invited American generals to visit
Taiwan regularly to exchange views on the latest situation in the
Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's defense capabilities," the official said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's location is strategically important in the Pacific
Ocean, the official said the U.S. Pacific Command of course maintains
close relations with Taiwan and that its commander is high on
Taiwan's invitation list.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Monday that peace in the Taiwan Strait is not only crucial to
the Republic of China's well-being but also complies with its common
interests with the United States.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue made the remarks in response to
press queries about the ministry's views on the latest media reports
that the United States will beef up its West Pacific military forces
to cope with mainland China's intensified military buildup,
particularly its deployment of a large number of missiles targeting
Taiwan along the southeastern mainland coast.</P>
      <P>Noting that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait have been
the ROC's top security concern, Chang said several influential
figures in the new Bush administration recently reaffirmed the U.S.
commitment to helping maintain peace and stability in the strait
based on the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>"We recognize the U.S. determination and efforts to help
safeguard Taiwan's security," Chang said, adding that the ROC and the
United States share common interests in maintaining Asia-Pacific
regional peace and stability.</P>

      <P>A group of lawmakers from the opposition
Kuomintang on Monday called on President Chen Shui-bian to postpone
his forthcoming trip to Latin America amid the nationwide economic
slump.</P>
      <P>In a press conference at the Legislative Yuan, KMT lawmakers
ridiculed the president as believing that going overseas to shake the
hands of foreigners is more important than the livelihood of Taiwan's
laborers who have been the major victims of the country's sagging
economy.</P>
      <P>The KMT lawmakers asked Chen to postpone his Latin American trip
slated for May 21-June 4 until the economy at home takes a turn for

      <P>KMT Legislator Cheng Feng-shih said he personally does not buy
the results of a recent public opinion poll conducted by a

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has continued to maintain
"measured pressure" on Taiwan in the wake of a recent series of
contentious events, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, made
the remarks in an internal report delivered at an MAC advisory
meeting.</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that mainland China has launched verbal
attacks on former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's recent
medical trip to Japan, his plan to visit his alma mater -- Cornell
University in New York State -- and the new U.S. arms sale package to
the ROC.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the report went on, mainland China has so far not
raised its "measured pressure" on Taiwan to the level of "strong
action" against the island.</P>
      <P>The report noted that the mainland and the United States have
resolved through diplomatic channels their dispute over a midair
collision between a U.S. surveillance plane and a mainland jet
fighter.</P>
      <P>As mainland China has not tried to take advantage of the
collision incident to escalate its confrontation with the United
States, the report said, this indicates that Beijing-Washington
engagements will focus on strategic and military security affairs in
the short term.</P>
      <P>As for the incident's possible impact on future relations across
the Taiwan Strait, the report said it would be premature to make any
forecast in this regard at the moment.</P>
      <P>The report further said mainland China's intensified efforts to
strengthen relations with its neighbors such as North Korea, India
and Vietnam, as well as mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
recent visit to major Latin American countries, signify Beijing's

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Monday that nearly one year after his inauguration, he takes
great pleasure in seeing achievements in neutralization of the
 ROC armed forces.</P>
      <P>"Nearly after one year in office, I'm most satisfied with our
achievements in military neutralization, in addition to breakthroughs
on arms procurement and diplomatic fronts," President Chen said
while meeting with visiting Guatemalan Defense Minister Eduardo
Arevalo Lacs.</P>
      <P>Noting that he came from an opposition party, Chen said his
family and career backgrounds had not allowed him to forge any ties
with the military before he took office last May.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, our servicemen are loyal to our country,
constitution and the 23 million people of Taiwan," Chen said, adding
that over the past year, those who have shown the greatest amount of
support, loyalty and allegiance to the ROC's popularly elected
president are its military officers and enlisted men.</P>
      <P>Chen said he appreciates ROC Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen and
Chief of the General Staff Tang Yao-ming for their efforts in
promoting military neutralization.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to point out that Guatemalan President Alfonso
Antonio Portillo Cabrera also came from the opposition camp and
that he has been impressed by Portillo's efforts to neutralize
Guatemala's armed forces.</P>
      <P>For his part, Arevalo said he fully agrees with Chen's
recognition of the importance of military neutralization in a
country's national development.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the pivotal functions of a country's armed forces
lie in maintaining national sovereignty, dignity and security,
Arevalo said the Guatemalan military will continue to dedicate
itself to protecting national security, people's well-being and
human rights.</P>
      <P>As President Chen is scheduled to visit Guatemala in late May,
Arevalo said the Guatemalan government and people welcome Chen's

      <P>One day before labor groups are expected

      <P>Lin made the comment after being bombarded with questions from

      <P>A former agent of the National Security
Bureau (NSB) said Monday that he would lodge a lawsuit against the
NSB to seek NT$100 million compensation for being assigned to
work in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang Chih-peng, accompanied by his lawyer, said at a press
conference that former President Lee Teng-hui's declaration in 1996
that missiles fired by the mainland into waters near Taiwan were not
armed led to a number of secret agents working in the mainland being
arrested.</P>
      <P>He also said the NSB and the Intelligence Bureau of the Ministry
of National Defense have so far not yet responded to his appeal,
prompting him to lodge his lawsuit.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that he will leave for Hong Kong June 1 to
retrieve a tape believed to contain NSB instructions to its
operatives from a safe in Hong Kong. He said he will then go to the
mainland and attempt to turn himself in to Beijing authorities in
return for the release of his captured NSB comrades. He also said he
will not rule out "stronger retaliation" to "punish the Taiwan
intelligence authorities."</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-hua has accused Lee of leaking state secrets
by declaring that Beijing fired blanks during the 1996 missile crisis
in the Taiwan Strait. As a result, he claimed, "a lot of our agents

authorities." Chang was forced to flee from the mainland and the
Taiwan intelligence network in mainland was destroyed, he further
claimed.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday "job
first" will be the top working principle for his administration and
that the government is reinforcing social security measures and
subsidies to the unemployed to minimize pressure on local workers.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with 30 model workers
selected from various manufacturing and service sectors in
celebration of the May 1 Labor Day, which falls on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 21st century would be an era of "low economic
growth and high unemployment rate," Chen said the government is
keeping high alert on a possible scenario in the near future that
the domestic jobless rate exceeds 4 percent.</P>
      <P>"From America to Asia, countries in the world are facing the
challenge of adjusting to economic transition," Chen said, adding:
"Taiwan is no exception. Tens of thousands of blue- and
white-collar workers and their families are suffering from the impact
of the transition."</P>
      <P>And in the face of gloomy job prospects, Chen assured the labor
representatives that his administration will do its utmost to create
more jobs and help local workers find a way out.</P>
      <P>With the domestic unemployment rate skyrocketing, many
unemployed workers are planning to take to streets Tuesday to appeal
for government attention to their plight. Chen's remarks were seen
as part of the government's efforts to calm disgruntled jobless
laborers.</P>
      <P>President Chen said he is confident that his administration is
moving in the right direction centering around "three firsts" --
"Taiwan first, economy first and investment first."</P>
      <P>In the short term, Chen said, the government is promoting
various job creation programs by stimulating domestic demand, such as

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung denied Tuesday
charges by ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Frank
Hsieh that "some officials" spend more time "sampling wine and
playing cards" than they do at work.</P>
      <P>Chang added that in fact, his Cabinet has been working "day and
night" without weekends off or holidays.</P>
      <P>Responding to another accusation by Hsieh -- that state-run
enterprise lay-offs have only worsened the nation's unemployment
problem -- Chang said that although the government is "very
concerned" about the issue, it has to strike a balance between
increasing the competitiveness of state enterprises and caring for
workers.</P>
      <P>He added that a responsible Cabinet cannot look at the issue from
only one perspective.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who serves concurrently as mayor of the southern Taiwan
city of Kaohsiung, said at an interpellation session of the Kaohsiung
City Council earlier in the day that although President Chen
Shui-bian has been trying to narrow the economic gap between northern
and southern Taiwan, "some officials" still do not understand the
south.</P>
      <P>He added that only if these officials can take the time out to
understand the people's "sufferings" will the nation's politics show
any signs of change for the better.</P>
      <P>After the interpellation session, he said that the unemployment
problem is very serious in southern Taiwan and that lay-offs from
state enterprises have not been accompanied by measures to help the
workers find other jobs.</P>
      <P>Hsieh urged Cabinet officials and legislators to listen more to
the "voice of the grassroots."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has no idea whether it will be put
on the "priority watch list" by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR)
office, but is sure that it will not be named a "priority foreign
country," an economics official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The USTR office was expected to unveil as early as late Monday
its annual report, which ranks its trade partners engaging in what it
calls "unfair trade practices" in five categories. "Priority foreign
country" is the most serious listing and can draw trade sanctions
from Washington, followed by "priority watch list," "watch list,"
"special mention list" and "other observation list."</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been put on the watch list for two consecutive years
and there is no chance of the island being removed from the list this
year in light of Washington's complaints over intellectual property
rights violations by Taiwan companies, said Vice Economics Minister
Chen Ruey-long, who is the island's leading trade negotiator with the
United States.</P>
      <P>Preliminary reports from Washington said Taiwan might be further
penalized on the five-rank scale because of its failure to live up to
U.S. expectations regarding intellectual property rights protection.</P>

      <P>Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen and Chief of
the General Staff Tang Yao-ming were briefed Monday on the results
of the just-concluded arms procurement talks with the United States,
military sources said.</P>
      <P>The briefing was given by Vice Chief of the General Staff Huo
Shou-yeh and several other military officers who wrapped up the
Republic of China's annual discussion with the United States on the
procurement of new weaponry systems in Washington, D.C. last week.</P>
      <P>During the talks, the Bush administration approved the biggest
U.S. arms sale package to Taiwan since 1992, including eight
diesel-powered submarines, 12 P-3C anti-submarines aircraft and four
Kidd-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>The sales package is expected to help upgrade Taiwan's naval
defense capabilities, military experts said.</P>
      <P>Ministry of National Defense (MND) sources said Defense Minister
Wu has ordered the General Staff Headquarters (GSH) and the Navy
General Headquarters to finalize evaluations as soon as possible of
various weaponry items that the United States has agreed to sell.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, both the MND and the GSH fully
support the purchases of the eight diesel submarines. Although
the United States has yet to determine how to help Taiwan acquire
the badly needed submarines, the MND and the GSH have agreed to push
the government to earmark funds to finance the procurement plan.</P>
      <P>As local society remains far divided over the Kidd-class
destroyers procurement plan, the MND plans to invite
lawmakers, scholars and military experts to discuss whether
Taiwan should buy this type of warplanes. And the Navy General
Headquarters is expected to come up with a detailed evaluation for
the MND to make a final decision within three months, MND sources
said.</P>

      <P>In a news release, the ministry revealed that an inspection team

      <P>The team advised that the medical mission should concentrate on
such fundamental jobs as assisting in hospital management, creating

      <P>The ministry agreed to follow the team's suggestions and
re-examine the nation's medical mission policies.</P>
      <P>Last month, a former member of the ROC medical mission in Malawi
accused the mission's leader of "medical negligence" that allegedly
led to the death of a Malawi state minister -- who was suffering from
polio, obesity, high blood pressure, an enlarged spleen and malaria.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SAID `LURING' RETIRED ROC GENERALS TO MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China legislator claimed
Monday that Beijing has recently started a project to attract retired
Republic of China generals to work in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Trong-rong of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), claimed that mainland China is "targeting former
high-ranking officers from Taiwan" who have retired because of the
military's streamlining program and "plans to offer them good posts"
in state enterprises or private corporations with investment from
Taiwan, Hong Kong or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Speaking on a planned visit of a group of retired local generals
to mainland China in June to be led by Legislator Fung Hu-hsiang of
the opposition New Party, Tsai said the DPP is glad to see exchanges
between retired military leaders of both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
However, he warned the retired generals not to "fall into the traps
set by mainland China," which would see them used as "bargaining
chips."</P>
      <P>Tsai claimed that Beijing has "reserved high posts" in "at least
100 state enterprises" for Taiwan's retired generals, and has also
"arranged some posts" for "other high-ranking retired Taiwan
officers."</P>
      <P>He urged local intelligence agencies to keep an eye on Beijing's
new united front operations and "the newest developments" regarding
Taiwan's high-ranking retired officers to "prevent the leaking of ROC
military secrets" to the other side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Fung pointed out that it was he who took the
initiative in suggesting to Beijing the visit of a group of Taiwan
retired generals to mainland China, a suggestion to which Beijing
agreed only after long deliberation. He denied that the visit is part
of a "united front operation."</P>
      <P>He went on to say that mainland Chinese state enterprises are
also undergoing streamlining and that many companies are slashing
their manpower. "In this situation, how can they be offering so many
high-level posts for retired generals from Taiwan?" Fung asked.</P>
      <P>Fung further pointed out that the retired officers are now
ordinary citizens who are at complete liberty to visit the mainland
in accordance with government regulations, and their visit is in fact
aimed at strengthening communications and avoiding conflict in the
face of increased military confrontation between the two sides of
Taiwan Strait.</P>
