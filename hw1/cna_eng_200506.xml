    <HEADLINE>ROC OFFICIAL SOLICITS FRENCH ART INDUSTRY TO EXPLORE TAIWAN MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  May 31 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of cultural
affairs on Tuesday called for the French art and design sectors to
make inroads into Taiwan where they may find brand new markets to
demonstrate French creativity.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-nan, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of Cultural
Affairs (CCA) , said that France used to market its industrial
products and military equipment to Taiwan, but it is time that the
country also known for its modern and contemporary art sell more
"cultural" products to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived in Paris recently to preside over the ninth
Taiwan-France Cultural Award presentation ceremony co-sponsored by
the CCA and the French Academy (Academie Francaise), made the remarks
during his visit at the prestigious Centre Pompidou, one of the most
daring modern arts museums in the world.</P>
      <P>Noting that currently there are many spaces in Taiwan which have
been left idle and are now targeted to be redesigned for public use,
Chen extended an invitation to French artists and designers to go to
Taiwan to explore new opportunities.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the CCA will in the future invite
internationally-known design firms to make field trips to Taiwan and
give their professional opinions on how Taiwan should redesign and
reconstruct these "idle spaces, " adding that the CCA will probably
sponsor international open bids for the development of such spaces.</P>
      <P>Chen and Pierre Messmer, president of the Academie Francaise,
jointly presided over the presentation ceremony for the Taiwan-France
Cultural Award, which are aimed at promoting cultural exchanges as
well as serving as a bridge to strengthen contact between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>This year's award was presented to two research groups
represented respectively by Chantal Zheng, director of the Institute
for Research on Southeast Asia at the University of Provence, and
Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a senior research fellow of a Chinese study
team at the French National Center for Scientific Research.

    <HEADLINE>EPA FORMING VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION SQUADS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) is planning to form and dispatch 10-member environmental
protection squads to each city and county around the island to
reinforce its environmental surveillance operations in local areas,
an EPA official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Last December, the Cabinet-level administration recruited several
retired public servants, military personnel and public school
teachers to form the first "environmental guard" of the country.
Inspired by the guard's efficient performance in assisting the
government to promote environmental protection, the EPA has decided
to recruit more retired public servants to engage in the volunteer
work.</P>
      <P>The official said that the planned local environmental squads are
expected to be set up by the end of June and soon after kick off
their mission of working to prevent pollution.</P>
      <P>The guard could help local environmental protection authorities
collect evidence, including photos, against suspected polluters and
help stop such illegal activities before they expand into major
environmental disasters, the official said.</P>
      <P>The squads' work will also include publicizing environmental
protection regulations and encouraging people not to engage in
environmentally-unfriendly behavior, such as littering, the official
said.</P>
      <P>All retired public servants, public school teachers and service
persons aged under 70 are qualified to apply for the volunteer
positions, the EPA official said, indicating that applicants will be
given tests and professional training before they are certified as
members of an environmental squad.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the work is voluntary in nature, squad
members will be awarded with money if they help in cracking major
pollution cases under existing regulations, the official added.</P>
      <P>Those who are interested in applying can do so at any of the
EPA's offices around the island, or phone the EPA hot line at
(04) -2252-1718, ext. 163 or visit the bureau's Web site at
http://www.epa.gov.tw for more information.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER JUSTIFIES TAX REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tax reform proposals unveiled recently by
President Chen Shui-bian should not be construed as an
across-the-board tax hike, Premier Frank Hsieh claimed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At a weekly Cabinet meeting, Hsieh said the reforms are aimed at
establishing a fair taxation system by expanding the tax base and he
instructed the authorities to explain the idea to the public to
minimize their resistance to the tax increases.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that it is difficult to promote tax reforms in any
country, especially when the reforms involve tax hikes for the
public.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that proposals to expand the tax base have
failed on many occasions to win the support of the Legislative Yuan,
which, he claimed, is quick to pass proposals on tax cuts and
exemptions.</P>
      <P>With the tax system having become "distorted" under these
circumstances, the continued expansion of social welfare is causing a
fiscal gap for the government, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, although the tax reform plans will increase
the tax burden for certain sectors, they do not mean an
across-the-board tax hike, because commodity tax, stamp tax, gift tax
and inheritance tax will decrease.</P>
      <P>The government will also work out complementary measures to
ensure the burden upon the underprivileged will not become heavier,
he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, commenting on the issue during a trip to the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park, Vice President Annette Lu said the tax
reform proposals were put forth by the president after a long period
of study and discussion with his economic advisers.</P>
      <P>Lu said the reform is necessary because the government's fiscal
condition is tight and Taiwan's tax rates are relatively low compared
with other countries.</P>
      <P>She promised that the government will follow the principles of
justice and fairness in promoting the reforms.</P>
      <P>Chen said Monday that the reforms are aimed at raising the
average national tax rate from the current 13.6 percent to 15 percent
in three years and even higher -- to 18 percent -- as a mid-term
goal.</P>
      <P>The reform proposals unveiled by the president include hiking the
business tax by one or two percentage points to 6 percent or 7
percent and levying a capital gains tax on investment in unlisted
companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST TRAIN FOR KAOHSIUNG MRT SYSTEM UNVEILED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Vienna, June 1 (CNA)
(By S.F. Wang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first three-car train for the mass rapid
transit (MRT) system currently under construction in Taiwan's
southern port city of Kaohsiung was unveiled Wednesday at a ceremony
held at a Siemens plant in Vienna.</P>
      <P>Vice Transportation and Communications Minister Chou Lie-liung
and Sepp Rieder, a deputy mayor of Vienna, jointly presided over the
ceremony to mark the building of the first of Kaohsiung's MRT trains.</P>
      <P>The train will be transported to Cologne in Germany for tests
before being delivered to Kaohsiung in October, said Volker Kefer,
president of Siemens Transportation Business Division.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung MRT Bureau has ordered 42 of the trains from
Siemens. The first batch will be used on the R3 line connecting the
Hsiaokang International Airport and Santuo Road beginning in October
2006, according to Chou, who coincidentally was the director-general
of the Kaohsiung MRT Bureau before assuming his post at the
Transportation and Communications Ministry in February this year.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Rieder lauded Siemens' outstanding
expertise and technology in building electrical engineering systems
for MRT trains, which have helped create jobs and a better economy
for the Austrian capital of Vienna.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kefer praised Kaohsiung as a growing and promising
city. He particularly offered his admiration for Premier Frank Hsieh,
who was the mayor of Kaohsiung City prior to Feb. 1, and was the
prime mover behind the development of the Kaohsiung MRT project.</P>
      <P>The Siemens-built MRT cars -- in white and green livery and
boasting modern interior decor featuring LED display panels and
see-through seat partition walls -- are each capable of carrying 750
people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSH REAFFIRMS STANCE ON PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO TAIWAN ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, May 31 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush reaffirmed
his commitment Tuesday to assist in resolving the Taiwan Strait issue
peacefully.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a White House news conference, Bush said
there is tension across the Taiwan Strait and that his position on
the issue has been very clear and consistent.</P>
      <P>Asked about the nature of U.S.-China ties, Bush said the
relationship is very complex. In some fields, such as trade, the two
countries are competitors, he said, adding that in other domains,
such as the anti-terrorism campaign and the North Korea issue, the
two countries are partners.</P>
      <P>As far as the Taiwan issue is concerned, Bush said, the
relationship is one of helping to solve the cross-strait dispute
peacefully.</P>
      <P>"Obviously, there's tension about Taiwan that we have to deal
with, and I made my position very clear and very consistent about
Taiwan. The Taiwanese understand my position. The Chinese understand
my position. So in this case, the relationship is one of helping to
solve that problem as to keeping stability in the region so that
eventually there will be a peaceful solution to that issue, " Bush
said.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that the United States has an obligation to
remind China that economic freedom is not enough to make a hopeful
society.</P>
      <P>"China is a fascinating country that is significant in its size.
Its economy is still small, but growing. But as well, I believe we
have an obligation to remind the Chinese that any hopeful society is
one in which there's more than just economic freedom; that there's
religious freedom and freedom of the press," Bush said.</P>
      <P>In his meetings with different Chinese leaders, Bush said, he has
always brought up issues such as the Dalai Lama, or the Catholic
Church's inability to get a bishop into China, or the need for the
country not to fear evangelists, but to understand that religious
freedom leads to peace.</P>
      <P>"And so I'll continue doing that so long as I'm the president,
and at the same time help deal with this very complex relationship, "
Bush added.</P>
      <P>During his first term, Bush had on two occasions clearly stated
his stance on the Taiwan issue. Shortly after he assumed office in
2001, he said the United States will do whatever it can to help
Taiwan defend itself.</P>
      <P>In December 2003, he told Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao during a
meeting at the White House that the United States is opposed to
either side of the Taiwan Strait taking unilateral action that could
change the Taiwan Strait status quo. He also warned that if China
attacks Taiwan, the United States will not sit idly.</P>

      <P>China's offer to give Taiwan a pair of
pandas should be arranged through government-to-government

      <P>According to Cho, the delivery of the pandas to Taiwan must

    <TEXT>
      <P>In an effort to lower Taiwan's big trade
deficit with South Korea, the semi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) is inviting local businesses to join a
delegation that will visit South Korea in September to seek trade
opportunities, a TAITRA official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>South Korea has become the second-largest source of Taiwan's
foreign trade deficit behind Japan in recent years. According to
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) statistics, Taiwan's exports to
South Korea amounted to US$5.35 billion last year, while imports
reached US$11.63 billion.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, Taiwan's exports to South
Korea amounted to US$1.22 billion, marking a growth of 1.6 percent
over the year-earlier level. However, imports posted a surge of 18.2
percent at US$3.13 billion, the tallies show.</P>
      <P>To reduce the deficit, MOFA and TAITRA have mapped out various
projects aimed at expanding exports to South Korea, including the
September trade-promotion visit, the official said. He noted that
local businesses in the sectors of electronics, electrics, machinery,
communications, medical treatment equipment, chemicals, construction
materials, household and consumer products, textiles, foodstuffs and
hand tools are all welcome to have their representatives join the
delegation.</P>
      <P>Last year, South Korean exports reached over US$200 billion,
representing a 30 percent growth, according to TAITRA, creating a
trade surplus of US$29 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKERS OPPOSE BUSINESS TAX HIKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) legislators said Wednesday that during an upcoming
meeting with President Chen Shui-bian they will oppose the
government's plan to increase business tax.</P>
      <P>The legislators argued that the government should abolish the tax
exempt measure for the hi-tech sector instead of increasing the
business tax, which they said will affect all consumers.</P>
      <P>Chen has since May 18 met with two different groups of DPP
legislators to exchange views on various issues. He is scheduled to
meet a third group Thursday.</P>
      <P>The president unveiled Monday a set of tax reform proposals aimed
at raising the average national tax rate from the current 13.6
percent to 15 percent in three years and even higher -- to 18 percent
-- as a mid-term goal.</P>
      <P>The proposals include hiking the business tax by one or two
percentage points to 6 percent or 7 percent and levying a capital
gains tax on investment in unlisted companies.</P>
      <P>According to DPP Legislator Wang Jung-chang, the tax reforms
should not focus mainly on the adjustment of business tax but should
address the priority issues of taxation unfairness and the light tax
burden on the wealthy.</P>
      <P>Wang Shih-chien, another DPP legislator, said the tax hikes
should target the people at the top of the wealth pyramid, rather
than everyone.</P>
      <P>He proposed that the government revise the law to scrap the tax
exemption measure for the hi-tech industry, which according to him
will give an increase of several hundred billion new Taiwan dollars
in tax revenue annually.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the tax hike plans be postponed in light
of the rise in consumer prices.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with Wang, DPP Legislator Kuo Jung-chung said now is not
the right time to hike taxes and make life even harder for the
people.</P>
      <P>Kuo noted that the hi-tech sector has been able to generate high
profits every year mainly because it has enjoyed government
protection and various preferential taxation measures for a long
time. It is time, he said, for the sector to reciprocate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO KMT CHAIRMANSHIP ASPIRANTS OUTLINE VISIONS FOR PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two hopefuls for the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) chairmanship laid out their visions for the party
Wednesday, touching on the party's line, its strategy for the
year-end city and county chief elections, its exchanges with the
ruling party, cross-Taiwan Strait policy and its controversial party
asset issues.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou, both of whom concurrently serve as KMT vice chairmen, were
each given 30 minutes to air their views at the KMT Central Standing
Committee (CSC) meeting and were then grilled by 20 CSC members
befored giving their answers for 10 minutes respectively. </P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan was positive about the two candidates
after listening to their reports, and told them to engage in a
"gentleman's battle" in the July 16 chairmanship election.</P>
      <P>Wang said the KMT and its ally, the People First Party (PFP) ,
will take advantage of their majority in the Legislative Yuan and
will organize street protests, supposedly to "stop the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party from hurting Taiwan through populism."</P>
      <P>As long as the DPP will not address its "partial and biased way, "
the KMT will not stop its checks and balances, he said, adding that
this is an approach to keep "populism at bay."</P>
      <P>The party will also formulate legislation and create public
service issues so as to carry out a "quasi-ruling" goal and stop a
"populist government from having its own way," according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Ma for his part said the KMT will safeguard the sovereignty of
the Republic of China, its interests and dignity, and will adamantly
oppose Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan should not engage in a "desinicization" campaign but
should admit its cultural and historical roots, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that cross-strait tension has been the major hurdle to
Taiwan's development and that it has cast a shadow over East Asian
peace. For Taiwan, however, "it is a threat, but also an
opportunity," he added.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan cannot hinge its hopes on goodwill from the other side
and should maintain a credible deterrent force, but it should also
take advantage of its concentration on peaceful development at this
stage to seek the possibility of co-existence and co-prosperity, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Ma also spoke of his basic stance -- based on the Constitution
and the so-called "1992 consensus" of "one China, different
interpretations, " which the ruling Democartic Progressive
Party does not recognize the existence of -- to promote cross-strait
peace, exchanges and cooperation under the principles of equality and
dignity.</P>
      <P>The party will also follow through on Lien's five-point agreement
with Chinese President Hu Jintao during their April 29 meeting in
Beijing to promote cross-strait relations, which includes the
promotion of an end to hostility and the establishment of a
confidence-building mechanism, opposition to Taiwan independence and
a resumption of dialogue as soon as possible, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Wang largely echoed Ma's views, saying that he agreed with the
insistence on the "1992 consensus" and opposition to Taiwan
independence as outlined in the Lien-Hu consensus.</P>
      <P>He also said that most people in Taiwan are concerned with five
issues, including an end to hostility and a move toward peace,
direct cross-strait transportation links, cross-strait economic
cooperation, protection of the rights of Taiwan businessmen and
Taiwan's participation in international organizations that have few
political connotations.</P>
      <P>Wang reaffirmed that he will go to China in his capacity as
legislative speaker if needed and if the legislature passes a
resolution and the visit is based on equal footing.</P>
      <P>On the campaign strategy of the year-end elections, Wang said
the "pan blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP should launch a
united campaign in Taipei County and solidify its edge in northern
Taiwan. </P>
      <P>Taichung, Changhua and Nantou counties have deep rivalry between
the "pan-blue alliance" and the "pan green camp" of the DPP and its
ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the KMT and the PFP should step up cooperation
and engage in consultation to nominate shared candidates
in each city and county.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that neighboring cities and counties have increasing
number of issues that are shared between them, and that "pan-blue
alliance" candidates should unite with their counterparts in
neighboring cities and counties for campaigning. </P>
      <P>On party assets, Wang advocated that the top priority should be
given to retired and incumbent party workers and to keep a
substantial amount for the party's sustainable development.
In the longer term, the party should use its money frugally and 
major election expenditures should be financed by soliciting
donations, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the handling of the party assets should be speeded
up and that the party should encourage retirement without forcing
party workers to quit.</P>
      <P>The proceeds of handling the party assets should be published
regularly to avoid accusations of corruption, Ma added.</P>

      <P>The United States' top envoy to Taiwan will
host a luncheon June 9 with members of the National Defense Committee
in the Legislative Yuan to communicate with them on the long-stalled
major arms procurement package, a committee convener said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Wen-chung of the ruling Democratic Progressive

six Patriot Pac-3 anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-electric
submarines and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, which
has been blocked by the opposition-dominated legislature and had yet
to be put on the legislative agenda for review before the first
session of the legislature closed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan and the DPP have listed the major arms
procurement project as their top priority in a proposed extra
legislative session.</P>
      <P>Lee said that with Douglas Paal, director of the American
Institute in Taiwan, Taipei Office, communicating directly with the
opposition legislators, it will certainly help the major arms
procurement project in the extra legislative session, but he
predicted that the effects will be limited.</P>
      <P>He said the passage of the bill will have to return to its
fundamentals, adding that the triangular relations between President
Chen Shui-bian, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong will hold the key
to its passage.</P>
      <P>But PFP Legislator Lin Yu-fang said he had already declined the
invitation from Paal to avoid any "conflict of interests, " while KMT

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers and experts suggested Wednesday
that the government lower business tax for free trade zones to lure
manufacturers to such zones.</P>
      <P>They made the suggestion during a public hearing on complementary
measures for free trade zones sponsored by a group in the Legislative
Yuan to promote the tax legislation.</P>
      <P>Legislator Christina Y. Liu of the opposition People First Party
said the zones should be considered "special zones" in which there
should be complete liberalization. She urged a lowering of tax in the
zones so as to stay competitive with free trade zones in neighboring
countries.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuo Jung-tsung of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said that the tax rate should reflect the original
purpose of setting up free trade zones.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that compared with the tax ratios in neighboring
countries, Taiwan imposes too high a tax in free trade zones and
therefore cannot entice manufacturers to set up there.</P>
      <P>Chao Teng-chung, chairman of the Far Glory Group, said the
establishment of free trade zones is aimed at luring Taiwan
businessmen to return to Taiwan from China, but with a tax ratio of
25 percent, manufacturers will be more likely to consider China or
South Korea, both of which have lower tax ratios.</P>
      <P>Chao suggested lowering the tax ratio, but said the level of
lowering should consider other neighboring countries and should not
only be compared to China's level.</P>
      <P>Professor Wei Chi-lin of National Taiwan University predicted
that if the tax ratio can be lowered, it will lure Taiwan businessmen
and foreign manufacturers, which will in turn create higher tax
revenues.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has three free trade zones in Keelung, Kaohsiung
and Taichung harbors, respectively.</P>

unmanned Global Hawk reconnaissance aircraft and 12 strategic
refueling planes will be posted at Andersen permanently.</P>
      <P>As part of the new deployment plan, Andersen staff will increase
by 2,400 and new facilities will be built at the base. It will take
several years to complete the deployment plan, the NHK report said,
adding that an environmental impact evaluation survey is already
underway. The number of military aircraft to be stationed at the base
might also change in terms of the results of the environmental
survey.</P>
      <P>The NHK report further said the Pentagon is undertaking a
worldwide U.S. military re-deployment plan to cope with a reduction
of U.S. troops in South Korea and the changing world situation, and
that the Andersen bomber squadron deployment is part of that project.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A prospective Kuomintang (KMT) candidate for
Taipei County magistrate was shown the door Wednesday after she fared
poorly in a party-commissioned public opinion poll.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu said that she had "misgivings" about
the polling procedure and regretted the result, but said she will
respect the democratic system within the party and will withdraw from
the next stage of the primary -- which will be the voting among KMT
members.</P>
      <P>Hung noted that she had insisted on not soliciting donations at
this stage and so she did not have the financial power that other
prospective candidates have.</P>
      <P>She said that the poll will account for 70 percent of the result
of the party's primary, and if someone leads by a large margin, then
it is clear who the candidate will be.</P>
      <P>Saying that she didn't have the money to carry on, Hung said, "I
have fought a good battle."</P>
      <P>Legislator Chou Hsi-wei, who returned to the fold of the KMT from
the People First Party (PFP) to boost his chance of winning the
bitterly contested Taipei County magistrate race, said that Hung "has
set a good example" of integrating the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and the PFP.</P>
      <P>Chou said that he believes the polls are fair mechanism, and will
respect the procedure of the primary, adding that he is confident of
integrating the "pan-blue alliance" forces to run against the ruling
"pan-green" camp candidate.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-fu, director of the KMT's Taipei County branch, said
that the public polling company commissioned by the party is very
professional and was agreed upon by all the would-be candidates from
the outset.</P>
      <P>The official results of the public opinion poll will be released
after the vote by party members is completed, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sanchung City Mayor Lee Chien-lung said that in fact
only himself, Hung and another woman hopeful are qualified to run for
the party's candidate, adding that if the actual selected candidate
is not one of these three, he will not support this individual.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials of the American Chamber of
Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei will support the signing of a U.S.-Taiwan
free trade agreement (FTA) at their upcoming meetings with U.S.
government officials, the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In AmCham's 2005 Taiwan White Paper released Tuesday, the trade
organization recognized Taiwan's progress in the protection of
intellectual property rights and the cooperation between the island's
executive and legislative branches in several aspects, such as the
completion of an amendment to the IPR Law.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, several high-ranking AmCham officials had
said that they will support the signing of a U.S.-Taiwan free trade
agreement during their upcoming "doorknocking" trip to Washington,
D.C. slated for June 12-18, which is aimed at visiting U.S. trade
officials and members of Congress to discuss issues brought up in the
2005 Taiwan White Paper.</P>
      <P>Unlike previous years, the 2005 Taiwan White Paper does not give
priority to cross-Taiwan Strait issues, as AmCham President Tom
Johnson said he was happy to see that there has been increased
dialogue between the two sides in the last few years.</P>
      <P>Johnson noted that although there has not been substantial
progress in cross-strait economic and trade ties, he feels optimistic
on the future of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Instead, AmCham expresses more concern on several practical
issues this year, such as too much fake pesticides and medicines
being circulated in the market and punishments for forgers that are
too light.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHANGE OF KMT CHAIRMAN WILL NOT ALTER POLITICAL LANDSCAPE: KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If President Chen Shui-bian thinks that the
political climate will change after opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan steps down from the post he is "very mistaken, "
KMT spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen quoted the party chairman as saying
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that Lien made the remark following the party's weekly
Central Standing Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, Lien's rationale was that since the KMT is a
party coherent and consistent in assuming a task, the party's stance
will not be different simply because of a change in leadership.</P>
      <P>Lien also warned the president to stay on the alert in August,
when many issues of major public concern are expected to further
pressure him, pointing to the potential for fruit overproduction and
the possible failure to honor the government's promise to allow
Chinese citizens to sightsee in Taiwan, as examples.</P>
      <P>Lien's comments came after the president said over the last
weekend during a gathering with lawmakers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) that Taiwan's political situation will
improve in the middle of July after Lien quits the KMT's chairmanship
when his term expires.</P>
      <P>According to a DPP source, Chen was optimistic that Lien's
departure will create an improved political situation, which in turn
will help important bills clear the Legislative Yuan, such as a major
military procurement bill and approval of the list of presidential
nominees for Control Yuan members.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the president also contended that the KMT will stop
trying to investigate the March 19 shooting of himself and Vice
President Annette Lu by that time after a KMT chairman is produced
following a vote by party members set for July 16, the source added.</P>

      <P>An inter-ministerial roundtable will be held
early next month to address issues regarding domestic manpower
shortages, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , made the remarks a day
after the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei urged the
ROC government to set up a supra-ministerial panel to review its
manpower planning policy and regulations to remove barriers
to the upgrading of Taiwan's competitiveness in the global market.</P>
      <P>AmCham made the call in its 2005 White Paper on Taiwan's economic
environment.</P>
      <P>In response, Hu said the CEPD is drafting proposals to ease
manpower shortages faced by certain industrial sectors and to further
speed up processing of applications by multinational corporations to
allow their Chinese employees to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hu said, the CEPD will organize a ministerial-level
roundtable meeting in July to discuss manpower planning issues, with
the participation of senior officials from the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Council of Labor Affairs, the
Mainland Affairs Council and other relevant government agencies.</P>
      <P>Hu said the Executive Yuan has formed a manpower cultivation
panel which will serve as a platform for communications and
consultations with AmCham on human resources-related topics.</P>
      <P>In the face of globalization, Hu said the CEPD has given priority
to human resources development in recent years.</P>
      <P>"We have assisted many local universities to open master's
programs to cultivate talented people needed by high-tech
industries, " Hu said, adding that the government has also adopted
many measures in the past couple of years to open the door wider for
Chinese professionals to work in Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) reiterated its stance Wednesday that Taiwan and China discuss
Taiwan's farm exports under the framework of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the WTO mechanisms provide a secure platform
for Taiwan and China to conduct sound and effective agricultural
exchanges, an MAC spokesman said that Taiwan and China, both WTO
member states, should negotiate customs tariffs, customs clearance,
quarantines and certification issues under the WTO's framework to
best protect the interests of Taiwan's farmers.</P>
      <P>Although China is willing to offer preferential treatment to
Taiwan's farm exports, the MAC official said that such an approach
would produce only short-term benefits for Taiwan farmers and that
business risks would largely increase over the long term due to a
variety of uncertainties.</P>
      <P>China's hope that Taiwan would also remove its restrictions on
more than 800 Chinese agricultural products is a clear indication of
its long-term strategy in bilateral exchanges, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's farm exports to China reached around US$890,000 last
year, he said. Combining the outbound shipments to Hong Kong, the
value totaled US$7.54 million, accoutring for 1.07 percent of
Taiwan's agricultural exports and only 0.16 percent of the domestic
industry's overall production value, he added.</P>
      <P>The MAC spokesman's remarks came after officials of the Taiwan
Affairs Office under Beijing's State Council told a news conference
earlier the same day that China is poised to provide Taiwan fruit
imports with preferential treatment through private-sector
negotiations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YEAR-END ELECTIONS RESULTS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KMT CHIEF: WANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Responsibility for the performance of the
Kuomintang (KMT) in the year-end elections for county and city chiefs
will rest with whomever is elected as the party's new chairman,
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng was quoted as saying
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said that Wang, who is one of the
KMT's vice chairmen and is competing against Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou for the chairmanship, told the KMT Central Standing
Committee that the year-end elections will determine to a great
extent how the party will fare in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the new party chief to be elected on June 16 will be
held responsible for the results of the party, even if the candidates
were chosen under the watch of current party Chairman Lien Chan, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while giving a briefing to the Central
Standing Committee about his vision for the party, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman also said Wang listed five priorities for the new
party chief, including pressing forward with reforms within the
party, solving the thorny problem of the party's assets that are
alleged by political rivals to have been acquired illegally, laying
off the party's redundant workers, and dealing with the competition
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>If elected KMT chief, Wang said, his roles as both speaker of the
legislature and KMT chief will put him in good stead for leading the
party to victory in its political struggle with the DPP.</P>
      <P>He also said that his experience as legislature speaker for three
consecutive terms bears witness to his capability to command the
support of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) , which is vital
for the KMT to win the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Although the party chairman is very likely to bear the party
standard in the 2008 presidential race, Wang suggested that he may
not necessarily run on the KMT ticket; rather, he said the party
chief should choose a pair of candidates with the best chance for
victory in the 2008 election.</P>
      <P>Instead of being the party's candidate-apparent for the 2008
presidential race, the KMT chairman should be a person who devotes
himself to uniting the KMT, the PFP and other political allies to
rally behind the party's presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>Wang's remarks were apparently directed at Ma, who has been
touted as the party's best hope for the presidency in 2008 and who is
trying to win the chairmanship before bidding for presidency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. OFFICIAL URGES E.U. NOT TO TILT MILITARY BALANCE WITH CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  1 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Under Secretary of State for
Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns has recently urged the European
Union not to unduly affect in a negative way the military balance
between the United States and China, particularly concerning the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Burns made the call in a speech delivered at the Translatic
Democracy Network Conference held in Brussels May 26. The State
Department issued text of the speech Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Burns said that managing relationship with a
rising China and continuing to ensure stability and peace in East
Asia is a major American preoccupation.</P>
      <P>Since the European Union announced that it was going to lift its
arms ban on China, imposed for human rights reasons just following
the Tiananmen Square Massacre in June 1989, Burns said, there has
been a very vigorous debate between the United States and the E.U.
about that.</P>
      <P>The core of the American argument has been that Europe needs to
understand that not only did America have security commitments in
Europe over the last 60 years, it has the same commitments in Asia.</P>
      <P>"We are the guarantor of stability in Asia. In the Taiwan Straits
and in the entire Asia Pacific region, through our treaty
relationships with Japan and South Korea, Australia, and our security
commitments to the Philippines and Thailand, an American naval and
air presence in Asia has been the single greatest factor. That has
meant there has been no major regional war in Asia since the 2nd
World War. Certainly no conflict that would directly pit the
interests of the great powers in Asia itself," Burns said.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Burns said, Europe had to und erstand how
important it was that Europe not unduly affect in a negative way the
military balance between China and the United States, particularly
concerning the Taiwan Straits as well as the wider responsibilities.</P>
      <P>"We're very pleased now that the European Parliament has spoken
out so clearly on this arms sales issue. It's a difficult one. We
understand the motivations of the European Union, but we cannot
accept that Europe would move forward when we are alliance partners
and we have such profound security interests in East Asia itself.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beginning dialogue with China on political
issues would be difficult now since Beijing has not changed its
policy toward Taiwan, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar sponsored by National Chengchi University
on the challenges facing Taiwan, Wu said when Beijing officials talk
about a possible peace agreement with Taiwan, they predicate this on
their "one China" principle, " and they term any opening of direct
transportation links with Taiwan a "domestic affairs." The fact is,
Taiwanese don't want to unite with China under Beijing's "one
country, two systems" formula, he said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that China has not changed one iota of its strategy of
"uniting its minor enemies to fight its major ones, " and has not
slowed down its deployment of missiles targeting Taiwan - about 700
altogether currently - and is aggressively building up its submarine
fleet of 50 vessels, which is powerful enough to pose a serious
threat even against Japan.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said, negotiations with China on non-political issues
is possible.</P>
      <P>The view of the chief of the Mainland Affairs Council is contrary
to that of Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who called for
dialogue with China in his speech on the same occasion, saying that
dialogue will promote peace across the Taiwan Strait while stalemate
serves the interest of no one.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's seminar brought together more than 200 political,

is that America has security commitments in Asia just as it has in
Europe, and Europe's lifting of the arms embargo would unduly affect
in a negative way the military balance in Asia.</P>
      <P>Burns said his country understands the motivations of the
European Union, but the United States cannot accept that Europe would
move forward when they are allied partners and they have such
profound security interests in East Asia.</P>
      <P>The U.S. official said the United States would like to see a more
outward-looking Europe that will work with the United States in the
promotion of democracy in Asia, and in trying to ensure stability in
Asia.</P>
      <P>The Europe Union, which mulled the possibility of ending the arms
embargo, decided to shelf the idea for the time being because of
Washington's opposition.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative and National Assembly
caucuses of the opposition People First Party (PFP) on Thursday
formally applied for a constitutional interpretation by the Council
of Grand Justices on whether the delegates of the ad hoc National
Assembly can vote on a constitutional amendment package.</P>
      <P>Citing the low 23.35 percent voter turnout in the May 14
National Assembly election, the petition said the delegates can
hardly be seen as representing the will of the people.</P>
      <P>Of the 3,913,338 people who did turn out to vote, only 3,224,240
voted for parties or groups that support the constitution reform
package, or not even 20 percent of the country's eligible voters,
raising serious doubts about the legitimacy of the delegates to vote
on the constitutional amendment package, according to the petition.</P>
      <P>Fan Kuang-chun, secretary-general of the Judicial Yuan, said the
grand justices will handle the request according to the law.</P>
      <P>The ad hoc National Assembly, which convened for the first time
Monday, is set to vote on the constitutional amendment package June
7.</P>
      <P>A total of 300 National Assembly seats were allotted among the 12
political parties and civic groups taking part in the election in
proportion to the number of votes they garnered.</P>
      <P>The key mission of the ad hoc National Assembly is to review and
vote on a package of constitutional amendments passed by the
Legislative Yuan last August.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposals include reducing the number of seats in
the legislature from 225 to 113, extending the tenure of legislators
from three years to four years, adopting a "single seat, two ballots"
legislative electoral system, phasing out the National Assembly,
holding popular referendums on future constitutional amendments, and
empowering the Council of Grand Justices to screen presidential and
vice presidential impeachment proposals.</P>

      <P>The number of insurance policies owned by
people in Taiwan reached a per capita record high in 2004, with each
person owning an average of 1.7 insurance policies, according to a
report released Thursday by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The number of valid life and pension insurance contracts totalled
166.3 percent of the island's population as of the end of last year,

DGBAS report.</P>
      <P>In terms of personal insurance, the number of valid life
insurance contracts rose to 33.63 million as of the end of 2004, up
4.9 percent over the amount at the end of the previous year; injury

insurance contracts registered an annual growth rate of 1.7 percent
and 9.1 percent, respectively, in 2004, while that of injury
insurance contracts was down 3.6 percent.</P>

of insurance fell last year, with the exception of that for personal
pension insurance, which rose 1.2-fold over the previous year's

    <TEXT>The Straits Times: 
Civil Service takes lead with payout.

The Civil Service is taking the lead to
narrow the gap between low and high-income
earners by giving a $200 payout for staff in
their July pay packets.

This one-off payment will be on top of a
mid-year bonus of just under half-a-month's
salary, the Public Service Division said
yesterday.

The Lianhe Zaobao: Singapore's civil servants
to get a mid-year Annual Variable Componen.

Singapore's civil servants will get a mid-
year Annual Variable Component (AVC) of 0.4 month
and an additional one-off payment of $200 in 
July.

The Public Service Division (PSD)
announcement comes a day after the government
accepted the National Wages Council's guidelines
for July 2005 to June 2006.

The Government paid civil servants a

    <HEADLINE>TSU TO ASK FOR CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
official said Thursday that an article in the National Assembly
Operation Law is in gross violation of the Constitution and that the
TSU caucus in the ad hoc National Assembly will request a
constitutional interpretation from the Council of Grand Justices
Friday.</P>
      <P>TSU Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming was referring to Article 9
which stipulates that the National Assembly must vote on the
Legislative Yuan-approved constitutional reform package as a whole
instead of item by item.</P>
      <P>Noting that Article 25 of the Constitution states that the
National Assembly "shall exercise political powers on behalf of the
whole body of the citizens, " Chen said it is not appropriate for the
Legislative Yuan to put limitations on the exercise of this power
unless through a constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed the hope that before the grand justices hand down
their ruling on the matter, the National Assembly will vote on the
constitutional reform package item by item instead of as a whole.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposals include reducing the number of seats in
the Legislative Yuan from the current 225 to 113, extending the
tenure of legislators from the present three years to four years,
adopting a "single seat, two ballots" legislative electoral system,
phasing out the National Assembly, holding popular referendums on
future constitutional amendments, and empowering the Council of Grand
Justices to screen presidential and vice presidential impeachment
proposals.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the low turnout rate of 23.35 percent for the May
14 National Assembly election has created serious doubts about the
legitimacy of the 300 National Assembly delegates in representing the
people and voting on the constitutional reform package. The 300 seats
were allotted to the 12 political parties and civic groups taking
part in the election based on the proportion of votes they each
garnered.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the TSU respects the result of the election,
but the party advocates that when the 300 delegates vote on the
constitutional amendment proposals, they should stick to the
principle of procedural justice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA CONDEMNS CHINA'S ATTEMPT TO SHORTEN U.N. MANDATE IN HAITI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
condemned China Thursday over its pressuring the United Nations to
reduce a recommended one-year extension of the U.N. peacekeeping
mission in Haiti which maintains diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news conference, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu
said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended in May that the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti be extended for one year after its
mandate expired June 1.</P>
      <P>However, China insisted that U.N. peacekeepers would be needed in
Haiti for no longer than six more months. A Chinese official in Haiti
was quoted as having said a six-month timeframe would allow the
United Nations time to reevaluate its mission and extend it again if
necessary.</P>
      <P>The U.N. Security Council on May 31 extended the mandate of the
7,400-member peacekeeping mission to June 24, giving it more time to
settle the dispute with China.</P>
      <P>Lu said China's attempt to shorten the U.N. peacekeeping mission
in Haiti was part of its efforts to sabotage Haiti's longtime
diplomatic ties with the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, China was also angered by plans for Haiti's
interim President Boniface Alexandre to visit Taiwan in July.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Haiti's relations with Taiwan and its interim
president's Taiwan travel plan have nothing to do with the U.N.
peacekeeping mission in the Caribbean nation, Lu said China was
trying to abuse its clout in the U.N. Security Council to interfere
with Haiti's internal affairs.</P>
      <P>"We condemn this gross act by China," Lu said.</P>
      <P>It wasn't clear when the 15-member Security Council would vote on
the extension of the peacekeeping mandate in Haiti. China, as one of
the five permanent members, has veto power over the council's
decisions.</P>
      <P>A U.S.-backed interim government and U.N. peacekeepers have taken
over in Haiti since an armed rebellion led to the ouster of President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February 2004. Elections have been
scheduled for October and November. Haiti forged diplomatic ties with
the ROC in 1956.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S CURRENT TAIWAN POLICY MORE FLEXIBLE THAN BEFORE: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  June 1 (CNA)
(By C.F. Lee and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking Republic of China official
for mainland China affairs said Wednesday in New York that Beijing is
currently adopting a flexible policy toward Taiwan rather than a
rigid one as it did before.</P>
      <P>Huang Wei-feng, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
under the Executive Yuan, made the comments while meeting with
members of local think tanks at a seminar to exchange views on issues
regarding current cross-strait policy in Taiwan and in the United
States, Taiwan-U.S.-China relations and Taiwan's constitutional
amendments.</P>
      <P>The official, at the head of a delegation of Taiwan reporters,
said that China's Taiwan policy is currently showing signs of
flexibility rather than rigidity.</P>
      <P>In order to calm down the negative feelings of the Taiwan people
after the passage of the Anti-Secession Law in March, China not only
invited two leaders of Taiwan's opposition parties -- Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong -- to
visit the mainland, but also made some proposals aimed at resolving
cross-strait differences, he further said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Huang also questioned the proposals, saying that
Beijing's precondition of making such proposals is that Taiwan must
accept the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Urging the United States to support Taiwan and push Beijing to
engage in dialogue with the island, Huang said that by doing this,
both sides of the Strait can then move forward toward further
exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>The participants at the gathering also agreed that Beijing has
become more flexible in dealing with Taiwan since Hu Jintao took over
as president of China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a scholar said at the conclusion of a conference held
by three U.S. think tanks last Wednesday in Washington, D. C. that
the Bush administration's current cross-strait policy, which attaches
great importance to maintaining the status quo, is workable and
functions properly. He added that the policy hopes to make Taipei and
Beijing realize that the United States will never accept a unilateral
change to the status quo by either side.</P>
      <P>According to the scholar, more than 30 U.S. officials and members
of think tanks, including former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Randall Shriver, attended the conference in which some participants
said that they believe that the Bush administration's cross-strait
policy has six key points. They are:
A. Regardless of unification or independence, the U.S. insists that</P>
      <P>cross-strait problems should be resolved peacefully and that the</P>
      <P>resolution should be accepted by the people of both sides.
B. The U.S. will continue to warn China not to use force against</P>
      <P>Taiwan, while the island should not provoke the mainland into</P>
      <P>conflict.
C. The U.S. security concept is "residual security value" -- Taiwan</P>
      <P>must determine to defend herself first and the U.S. will then be</P>
      <P>able to protect the island's security.
D. The U.S. will continue to recognize the Beijing government and</P>
      <P>respect the existing "one China" policy.
E. The U.S. will continue to strengthen its trade, economic and</P>
      <P>cultural relations with China.
F. The U.S. refuses to play a mediator role between the two sides of</P>
      <P>the Strait and cross-strait problems should be resolved by Taipei</P>
      <P>and Beijing themselves.</P>
      <P>The participants at the conference also felt that Taipei and
Beijing will eventually have the means to resolve their differences,
noting that the both sides will certainly be able to find room in
President Shui-bian's so-called "foundation laid by the results of
the 1992 Hong Kong talks" and Beijing's so-called "1992 consensus" to
solve any problems.</P>

      <P>While the number of medical visits for enteroviral infections has
been rising for 10 consecutive weeks in the country, the outbreak may
peak in the next couple of weeks, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The enteroviral outbreak has so far resulted in 36 school
closures, mainly in daycare centers and kindergartens, with 25 cases
occurring in northern Taiwan and 11 in the central part, they said.</P>
      <P>Most of the severe infections have been reported in central
Taiwan, with 31 cases, while there have been nine cases in the south,
six in the north and one in the east, they added.</P>
      <P>The officials urged parents to watch closely if their children
develop any symptoms of severe illness in the five days since
symptoms of enteroviral infection start to appear and send them to a
hospital.</P>
      <P>These symptoms include excessive sleepiness, decreased
responsiveness, weakness and paralysis of the extremities, muscle
pain, vomiting, fever, irritability, coma, shortness of breath,
increased or irregular heartbeat.</P>
      <P>While the symptoms of enteroviral infections can be similar to
that of flu, some patients may develop blisters on their hands, feet
and mouths and even pneumonia, myocarditis and encephalitis.</P>
      <P>As enteroviruses are transmissible via direct contact with
secretions from an infected person or contact with contaminated
surfaces or objects, practicing good personal hygiene is crucial to
preventing infections, according to the CDC.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
(TECO) in New York will move to a new location in August in the
city's prime district, director Andrew L. Y. Hsia said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsia made the remarks while briefing a group of journalists from
Taiwan led by Mainland Affairs (MAC) Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng.</P>
      <P>The new TECO office will be located in a building on the
intersection of 5th Avenue and 42th Street, in which about 10
outposts of relevant government agencies in New York, such as the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Council
for Cultural Affairs and the Financial Supervisory Commission, will
also be relocated, Hsia said.</P>
      <P>According to Hsia, the government spent NT$1.7 billion (about
US$54 million) to purchase and refurbish the building, which has 16
floors and two basement floors.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether the building would be named the
"Taiwan Building" or "Taiwan Plaza, " Hsia said that his office has
not received any order from the representative office in Washington
regarding the issue. He added that his office will continue
operations at the new office under the name of "TECO" following a
grand opening slated for early August.</P>
      <P>At the head of a 13-member delegation composed of Taiwan
reporters, Huang arrived in New York Tuesday for a 10-day visit to

      <P>The delegation paid a visit to the United Nations and met a group

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) has
recommended that three local elections be held simultaneously on Dec.
3 to save costs, CEC officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>These elections include those for city and county chiefs, city
and county councilors as well as township and village heads.</P>
      <P>The CEC officially notified the electoral committees of the
concerned cities and counties of its recommendation on Wednesday to
hear their opinions, with most of the respondents agreeing to hold
the three elections at the same time, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The CEC will communicate with cities and counties that are
hesitant about the idea and will help them resolve any problems that
they may have, they said.</P>
      <P>Also on Thursday, lawmakers across party lines expressed their
support for the CEC's plan but urged the government to step up its
crackdown on vote-buying that is expected to become prevalent in the
year-end, three-in-one elections.</P>
      <P>Chen Chieh, a whip of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislative
caucus, said although holding the three elections simultaneously may
not be favorable to the party's campaign strategy, the KMT supports
the plan because it will help save costs.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-pin, convener of the opposition People First Party
legislative caucus, predicted that vote-buying activities will
increase during the upcoming elections in light of the large number
of candidates participating in the races, which he said requires more
intensive efforts to bring lawbreakers to justice.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with Chen, Taiwan Solidarity Union legislative caucus
convener Lo Chih-ming said the government must take precautions
against interference by local factions and gangsters in the elections
as well as guarding against any outbreaks of violence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CASE STILL OPEN ON PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION-EVE SHOOTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors are not about to end their
investigations into the March 19, 2004 presidential election-eve
shooting of the president and vice president in spite of a media
report to the contrary, Kuo Jen-ni, the chief prosecutor of the
Tainan Prosecutor's Office, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kuo was responding to a United Daily News article that the
investigative team will indict their prime suspect, Chen Yi-hsiung,
on the charge of attempted murder, but since Chen apparently
committed suicide shortly after the shooting, the court will dismiss
the case.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that officials were surprised by the report, adding that
the task force still meets regularly.</P>
      <P>The gun used in the shooting has yet to be recovered and Kuo said
that law enforcement officials are still looking for it in the hope
that it will turn up at some point.</P>
      <P>The task force in the meantime is sorting out information
compiled over the past year, and there is no timetable for closing
the case, she said, adding that the task force will make an
announcement when this happens.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said Thursday
that after the identification of the lone gunman in early March, most
CIB agents of the task force have returned to their original posts
and Hou Yu-ih, the CIB's commissioner, is now working on a report of
the case.</P>
      <P>It is initially estimated that the more than 100,000-character
report will be divided into two parts on forensics and investigation,
and will address the areas of the case still in question.</P>
      <P>Some people wonder if Chen really did drown himself after the
shooting and are unconvinced about the case since the weapon used has
never been found. However, the police have confirmed that Chen was in
fact standing in the "hot zone" of the crime scene because he was
filmed by a video surveillance camera.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said that the party will respect the judicial ruling on the
shooting.</P>
      <P>William C. T. Lai, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, said that
any parties or individuals who can bring fresh evidence to the case
are encouraged to do so, but people coming forward to be critical for
no purpose will only hinder the investigation and create divisiveness
in society.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, an ally of
the DPP, said police should continue to search for the homemade gun
used against the president or the whole case will be flawed.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, a spokesman for the Kuomintang (KMT), said that
closing the case now would be an attempt by the government to cover
the truth.</P>
      <P>Chang said that president won re-election by a slim margin thanks
to two bullets. The government has tried to come out the shadow of
the shooting, but if there is no full accounting to the world and the
Taiwan people, then Chen Shui-bian will never shake off the title of
the "two-bullet president," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-ping, caucus whip of the People First Party (PFP), said
that if the case is closed rashly, it will result in political
discordance and bring new crises to the legality of the government.</P>
      <P>Lee said the shooting is not an ordinary criminal case, but is a
national security issue with the lives of the president and the vice
president at stake, and it shouldn't be closed without any evidence
having been produced.</P>
      <P>Lee urged those in the national security system who know the
truth and who have a clear conscience to come forward and expose the
truth courageously, just like the secret source "deep throat" in the
Watergate scandal, which brought down U.S. President Richard Nixon.</P>
      <P>She said that if the case ends abruptly, it will only prove the
need to form another "319 truth commission, " and the PFP caucus will
actively promote the formation of such a commission in the next
legislative session.</P>
      <P>The opposition-controlled fifth Legislative Yuan passed a special
statute authorizing the establishment of an independent "319 truth
commission" last year to investigate the case in which President Chen
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu were shot and slightly
wounded. However, the statute was later ruled to be unconstitutional
by the Council of Grand Justices.
</P>
      <P>President Chen and Vice President Lu were injured on the eve of
the presidential election when two homemade bullets grazed them as
they campaigned in an open jeep in the southern city of Tainan. After
the Chen-Lu ticket narrowly won re-election the following day, the
sole challenging ticket of KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman
James Soong accused the president of having staged the shooting to
win sympathy votes and filed two lawsuits to challenge the election
result. The lawsuits were rejected by the court.</P>
      <P>The special police team investigating the incident identified
Chen Yi-hsiung, 63, as the key suspect in the shooting shortly before
the first anniversary of the shooting. Chen Yi-hsiung was found dead
in Anping Harbor in Tainan March 29 last year -- 10 days after the
shooting -- in what police have said was an apparent suicide.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan,
reported the arrest of a man Thursday for attempting to blackmail a
famous beverage company with the threat of lacing their products with
poison.</P>
      <P>Police said that Chien Heng-wen, 36, who was previously convicted
of fraud, apparently tried to ride on the coattails of the panic
triggered by the recent case of a man who put cyanide in several
bottles of an energy drink called "bullwild" produced by the Paolita
Company, another famous beverage company.</P>
      <P>Chien was targeting the well-known Sanyo Whisbih drink.</P>
      <P>Chien reached the Whisbih company through its toll-free number
for consumers and demanded that NT$20 million (US$634,920) be
transferred to a designated account, or face the same fate as
Paolita.</P>
      <P>Police arrested Chien in downtown Kaohsiung in the early hours
Thursday, and in a search of his home later found that before he
targeted Whisbih, he had already blackmailed several medical
institutions as well as extorted money from owners of luxury cars.</P>
      <P>Chien said that he located luxury cars parking illegally and
would then call police to tow them away. After the cars were towed
away, he would change the phone numbers left on the scene by traffic
police to his own. When the owners called, Chien would then extort
money out of them.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a famous but yet unidentified manufacturer of snacks
reported to police that they have been receiving blackmail threats
via telephone and e-mail.</P>
      <P>Police said the company received unidentified calls May 31 to try
to extort NT$1 million, and later received threatening e-mails from
China.</P>
      <P>Police said that three extortion calls were made and they are now
checking whether they were real or pranks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DUST ALMOST SETTLED ON DPP CANDIDATES FOR YEAR-END ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The dust over the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) candidacy for the year-end city and
county chief elections has largely settled, party officials said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The DPP held party primaries (including a vote by party
members and public opinion polls) in six cities and counties to
determine its candidates.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the primaries, the DPP will nominate
former Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan to run for Ilan county
magistrate -- a post in which Chen has served two previous terms;
Hsinchu City Councilor Chen Kuei-yuan for the Hsinchu city mayorship;
former Legislator Su Chih-fen for Yunlin county magistrate; incumbent
Chiayi Mayor Chen Li-chen to run for a second term; former Mainland
Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san for Taichung county
magistrate; and incumbent Legislator Tsai Huang-liang for Nantou
county magistrate.</P>
      <P>As competition in three counties -- Taichung, Nantou and Yunlin
-- was fierce and bitter, party officials said the DPP headquarters
must step up fence-mending efforts to consolidate party unity.</P>
      <P>Former Legislator Lin Feng-hsi, who lost to Chiu in the Taichung
County primary, issued a statement earlier in the day that he would
not accept the outcome of the primary because he believes the opinion
survey was not fairly handled. He urged the party headquarters to
review its opinion survey regulations for the sake of protecting all
party members' rights. He also claimed that he was a victim of
factional strife within the party.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, incumbent Nantou County Magistrate Lin Tsung-yung had
refused to concede his defeat in the primary and it remained unclear
whether he would mount a maverick bid to compete with the party's
nominee in the year-end election.</P>
      <P>DPP candidates for some districts with no need to hold primaries
have also been determined, with five incumbents -- Changhua County
Magistrate Weng Chin-chu, Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen,
Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih, Tainan City Mayor Hsu
Tian-tsair and Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing -- to run
for second terms.</P>
      <P>In addition, former Council for Hakka Affairs Chairman Lo Wen-jia
will be nominated to run for Taipei county magistrate; Taiwan Salt
Co. Chairman Cheng Pao-ching for Taoyuan county magistrate; former
Government Information Office Minister Lin Chia-lung for Taichung
city mayor; and Chen Kuang-fu, head of the DPP's Penghu County
chapter, for Penghu county magistrate.</P>
      <P>The DPP has also decided to draft suitable candidates to run for
Keelung city mayor as well as Hsinchu and Miaoli county magistrates.
These three districts have traditionally been strongholds of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP). Party officials said the DPP headquarters will
step up a search for candidates after the ongoing ad hoc
National Assembly session concludes.</P>
      <P>As several hopefuls are interested in the Keelung mayoral post,
the party might conduct an opinion poll to determine who to draft.
The party will also consult with its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU), which has decided to nominate TSU Secretary-General Chen
Chien-ming to run for the post.</P>
      <P>In Hsinchu County, party sources said, the DPP will evaluate the
feasibility of cooperating with incumbent Legislator Chiu Ching-chun,
who withdrew from the KMT after the party decided to support
incumbent Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin to run for a second term.</P>
      <P>In Miaoli County, the DPP will give priority to drafting a Hakka
hopeful to join the race with a view to expanding the party's support
base in the Hakka community there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, party sources said, the DPP is almost certain not to
name its own candidate in Taitung County, which is also a pan-blue
bastion, and will throw its support behind incumbent Magistrate Hsu
Ching-yuan, an independent who is friendly toward the DPP.</P>
      <P>In the three other pan-blue strongholds -- Hualien County and the
two outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, the DPP will not make a
final decision on its nomination strategies until after further
consultations with influential figures and opinion leaders there,
party sources said.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan is hoping that three
bills concerning the restructuring of the government can be passed in
an extra session of the Legislative Yuan, Yeh Jiunn-rong, director of
the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission under the
Executive Yuan, said Thursday.</P>

bills that the Cabinet hopes to pass in the extra session.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the opposition parties are concerned about the
integration of the central government agencies, citing as an example
that the legislative caucuses of the opposition Kuomintang and the
People First Party are hoping that the Veterans Affairs Commission
and the Mainland Affairs Council will not be integrated with any
other agencies.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union

    <HEADLINE>TOO MANY QUALIFIED TEACHERS BANE OF EDUCATION SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Colleges and universities around Taiwan are
churning out qualified teachers, but with 180 graduates this year for
each opening, the number of unemployed teachers is growing, prompting
some to take to the streets June 12 to vent their frustrations.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chun-hao, convener of the Saving Compulsory
Education Alliance, there are currently about 60,000 college
graduates and masters degree holders who have a teaching license, but
there are fewer than 100 openings nationwide for teachers in
elementary and junior high schools this year.</P>
      <P>Since many colleges and universities in Taiwan have education and
teaching courses in their curriculums, about 18,000 individuals
qualified to be teachers at elementary or junior high schools
matriculate each year, said Chen, adding that the number of these
potential teachers has been snowballing on a yearly basis, posing an
increasingly serious problem in the education sector.</P>
      <P>The potential teachers, most of them having never had the
opportunity to teach after graduation, will walk the streets of
Taipei June 12 to ask the Ministry of Education to consider
increasing the number of teachers in elementary and junior high
schools and implementing small-class programs to create more openings
for the jobless who are qualified to teach, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the Saving Compulsory Education Alliance has
collected signatures from more than 10,000 potential teachers
islandwide in a short six-day period for the June 12 rally, although
the alliance has no idea yet exactly how many of them will turn out
to march.</P>
      <P>Prior to June 12, the alliance will ally with the National
Teachers' Association June 4, which will help magnify the alliance's
outcry against injustice in the nation's education policy, Chen added.</P>

(PFP) made the proposal Tuesday to Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou during
an interpellation session at the city council.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent public opinion survey on visitors
from China, PFP city councilman Tai Hsi-chin said there is an urgent
need for the municipal authorities to quickly upgrade the city's
tourist facilities and service quality.</P>
      <P>Should some 10,000 Chinese tourists be allowed to enter Taiwan
per day, it would be extremely difficult for the city to accommodate
such a large number of visitors with its current establishments,
including hotels and popular tourist spots, according to Tai.</P>
      <P>According to the poll results, Chinese visitors make an average
stay of 8.6 days in Taiwan, spending nearly two nights in Taipei,
Taiwan's largest city, he reported. Based on an average per-head
spending of NT$38,000 (US$1,210) by Chinese visitors in Taiwan, this
would generate roughly NT$2.5 billion in tourist dollars for Taipei
each month and some NT$30 billion each year, he said.</P>
      <P>The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, the National Palace Museum and the
Taipei 101 Building are the most popular sightseeing spots in Taipei
among Chinese visitors, PFP City Councilor Lin Tin-yung said.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that 84.4 percent of the Chinese tourists
questioned said that they would like to visit Taiwan again and that
they gave an average score of 83.5 points (out of a full scale of 100
points) to Taiwan, traffic disorder and currency exchange
inconvenience are some of Taipei's major shortcomings for them, PFP
City Councilor Lin Ting-yung said.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-ping, a PFP city councilwoman, claimed that the
government's opening would create a boon for businesses in Taipei.
However, she expressed doubt as to whether the city is ready for the
change and called on the municipal authorities to respond swiftly.</P>
      <P>In response to Beijing's offer to allow the Chinese general
public to make pleasure trips to Taiwan, the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said last week that bilateral negotiations on the issue could
begin this year after necessary coordination and arrangements have
been put in place.</P>
      <P>But it added that residents of Fujian Province will not be
included in the government's opening measure in the initial stage,
due to their bad record of absconding en masse upon arrival in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MAC officials expressed the hope that the Chinese authorities
will cooperate in scrutinizing the backgrounds and financial
situations of prospective tourists to Taiwan to help prevent illegal
overstays of their citizens here.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh has made it clear that the government is
poised to open up to Chinese tourists, but on condition that only a
maximum of 1,000 visitors, from various selected Chinese cities, will
be permitted to enter each day under a quota control management
system.</P>
      <P>The government will not allow full unfettered opening out of
grave concern of the many possible consequences if complementary
measures are not imposed, MAC officials noted.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level MAC is Taiwan's highest government agency
responsible for China affairs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, operators of tourism agencies in China told the
Central News Agency that public response to sightseeing in Taiwan has
been enthusiastic. Some agencies have even started taking
reservations from potential tourists, they said.</P>
      <P>Most of the Chinese tourism agencies are very optimistic about
the business prospects of the opening, saying that Taiwan has a
special appeal for Chinese people and expressing hope for direct
flights across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>For the time being, Taiwan only allows Chinese people residing
overseas or those traveling from a third country to visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CLARIFIES GIST OF HIS TAX REFORM PLANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday his
recent proposal to raise the domestic tax rate should not be
interpreted as a measure to increase everybody's tax burden.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a group of legislators
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) at the Taipei Guest
House for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Chen's six-point tax reform plan, which was unveiled after a
meeting of the Presidential Office Economic Advisory Panel last week,
has drawn broadsides not only from the opposition camp but also from
his own party.</P>
      <P>Chen took advantage of the meeting with DPP lawmakers to explain
in detail the rationale behind his proposals, stressing that the
reform will focus on expanding the tax base, restructuring and
simplifying the tax system and eradicating tax evasion.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP is a reform-oriented party, Chen said he will
not allow the fear of losing the popular vote to dissuade him from
carrying out the tax reforms.</P>
      <P>"The DPP came to power because of support from various levels of
people, including a lot of impoverished people. We should always give
priority to taking care of the disadvantaged and siding with the
poor. Our tax reform program will absolutely not increase the tax
burden on low-income families and will instead lessen or even exempt
their tax payments while levying more taxes on well-to-do families, "
he claimed.</P>
      <P>Touching on the details of his reform plan, Chen said the
proposal to raise the tax rate is not a scheme to raise everybody's
taxes. Instead, he argued, the plan has been drafted with an aim of
making the rich pay more while reducing the burden on the poor in
line with the principle of social justice and fairness.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's average tax rate is 13.6 percent, ranking
among the world's lowest. Chen said he is hopeful that the ratio can
be raised to 15 percent in three years and to 18 percent in the long
run.</P>
      <P>In 1990, when the opposition Kuomintang was in power, Chen said,
Taiwan's average taxation rate was 20.6 percent. Between 1992 and
1994, the ratio also surpassed 15 percent.</P>
      <P>"We are just trying to return to that level, " he said, adding
that the average tax rate in member countries of the Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development, also known as the "Rich Men's
Club," reaches a high of 27 percent.
</P>
      <P>Chen said he will direct relevant government agencies to
restructure and simplify the income tax scale with a view to cutting
low-income wage earners' tax burden while increasing the wealthy's
tax payments.</P>
      <P>"I feel regret that opposition parties and some news media have
deliberately distorted my tax reform plan as a plot to increase
everybody's tax burden," he said.</P>
      <P>As to a proposal to raise the business tax by 1 percent or 2
percent, Chen said it would be a complementary measure for
overhauling the consumer tax system.</P>
      <P>"Our current consumption tax system is not completely reasonable.
We will make an overall review and adopt measures to avoid double
taxation. While the business tax may be increased, the commodity
taxes may be reduced or even completely canceled," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>In comparison, he said, Taiwan's business tax is too low.
China's business tax reaches a high of 17 percent, he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the ultimate goal of the plan to establish a
minimum tax mechanism is to uphold fairness and justice in the
taxation system.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's inheritance tax is relatively high, Chen
said he has proposed to gradually lower the ceiling on such tax to 40
percent to equal the maximum income tax rate. High inheritance tax
only prompts local rich people to remit their money abroad, he added.</P>
      <P>With a view to raising the capital gains tax ratio in the
government's total tax revenues, Chen said he has called for a
feasibility study on levying capital gain taxes on transactions of
unlisted stocks.</P>
      <P>"This reform proposal is aimed at expanding our tax base to make
our tax system more reasonable and fairer. At present, wage earners
contribute three-quarters of the country's tax revenue, while capital
gains tax account for only one-quarter of the total tax revenue.
Under the current system, wealthy people are often exempt from
capital gains tax," he said.</P>
      <P>As many people have criticized the government's current measures
to encourage investment in high-tech industries, Chen said his
six-point tax reform plan will also require relevant agencies to
review tax incentives and financial subsidies for various industries
annually and to make necessary updates or adjustments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO YOUNG WHALE SHARKS FROM HUALIEN TRANSPORTED TO U.S. FOR RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien, eastern Taiwan, June 2 (CNA)
(By C.T. Liu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two young whale sharks were
transported by air Thursday to an aquarium in Georgia in the United
States for research, according to the Hualien Fishermen's
Association.</P>
      <P>The two sharks, captured by Hualien fishing boats in February and
April, respectively, passed health and quarantine examinations prior
to their shipment, said Wang Ming-chang, director-general of the
association.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, authorities of the privately-run Georgia
Aquarium contacted the association in April upon learning of the
capture of the sharks and offered NT$250,000 (US$8,000) each for the
animals.</P>
      <P>Although the whale shark is easily recognized, zoologists know
little about them.</P>
      <P>The whale shark is the biggest shark and the biggest fish in the
world. With distinctive light-yellow markings of random stripes and
dots on its very thick dark gray skin, the whale shark is a filter
feeder, although it has about 3,000 very tiny teeth. Adult whale
sharks can be up to 14 meters long and can weigh up to 15 tons,
although the average size is 7.6 meters.</P>
      <P>The Hualien Fishermen's Association first packed the whale sharks
into a container specially designed for transporting live fish and
then took them to the Hualien airport, where the container was put
aboard a charter flight bound for the Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport before heading for the United States.</P>
      <P>The two sharks, weighing 470 kg and 520 kg, respectively, are
each about 4 meters long.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, a Hualien-based fisherman also captured
another young whale shark in February 2004, which was later bought by
the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium in Pingtung,
southern Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Siemens AG will bid for Taiwan's first
light-rail streetcar system to be built in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, a Siemens executive said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Volker Kefer, the Germany-based firm's transportation division
chief, made the remarks a day after the first three-car train for
Kaohsiung's mass rapid transit (MRT) system was unveiled Wednesday at
a Siemens' plant in Vienna.</P>
      <P>With the concerted efforts of the Kaohsiung city government and
Siemens, Kerfer said Kaohsiung's MRT system is a success.
The first Kaohsiung MRT line connecting the Hsiaokang International
Airport and Santuo Road is scheduled to begin operations next year.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung has also decided to build a light-rail streetcar system
to complement its MRT system, a project that has been approved by the
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>It will be Taiwan's first light-rail streetcar system and will
require an outlay of NT$13.3 billion, with NT$5 billion for land
acquisition. Private investors are welcome to take part in the
project.</P>
      <P>The 15.2-km streetcar system, which will have 26 stations, is
scheduled for completion by June 2009.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AIMED AT BOOSTING EMPLOYMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has plans to invest some
NT$7.5 billion (US$240 million) to finance a community development
program nationwide over a span of three years from this year, aimed
at creating 37,000 jobs, Vice Premier Wu Rong-i said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Community leaders and authorities from cities, counties and
townships around the country are welcome to offer their respective
development plans to the Executive Yuan as part of the program, which
is titled the "Six Stars Program," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He added that to help lower the unemployment rate among the
aborigines, aboriginal rural townships are also welcome to apply to
join the program.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that some 8,000 jobs will be reserved exclusively for
aboriginal people over the three-year span, an effort that might
contribute to lowering the unemployment rate among aborigines to 4
percent-4.75 percent from the current 5.5 percent-6.25 percent, Wu
noted.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate among the aboriginal people stood at 5.76
percent in May 2004, marking a significant decline from 9.64 percent
posted in May 2003, thanks to the administration's promotion of an
employment program via public service over the past several years, Wu
added.</P>
      <P>The 5.76 percent unemployment, however, is still relatively much
higher than the average of 4.41 percent posted in Taiwan's
non-aboriginal sectors in May 2004, Wu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) offered
NT$50 million (US$1.59 million) Thursday for information leading to
the arrest of the man who shot President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu March 19 last year.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the news that former FBI Deputy Director Mark Felt
confirmed Tuesday that he was the source of the Washington Post,
dubbed "deep throat" by the paper when it broke the news about the
Watergate scandal in 1972, KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said his
party will give NT$50 million for Taiwan's "deep throat" who can come
out with information leading to the discovery of the truth of the 319
shooting.</P>
      <P>The Watergate scandal brought down U.S. President Richard Nixon in

      <P>The spokesman for the KMT, which suspects the shooting to be a

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRACY TO BE CHINA'S FINAL DESTINY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday he
believes that no matter how China develops politically, democracy
will be its final destiny.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in an article carried in an online weekly
bearing his nickname "A-bian."</P>
      <P>With the 16th anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen Massacre
approaching, Chen said it is time to review political developments on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait since 1989.</P>
      <P>While the Tiananmen Massacre stymied China's democratic
development, Chen said Taiwan has since accelerated its democratic
reform and has emerged as one of the most vibrant democracies in
Asia.</P>
      <P>Judging from Taiwan's experience, Chen said, he is convinced that
repressive rule only restricts humans temporarily and cannot
constrain them for ever.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Chen went on, although the
shadow of Tiananmen might gradually fade away, the "sun" of democracy
is dawning quietly in various corners of China.</P>
      <P>"I believe that no matter how bumpy China's political development
will be, democracy will be its final destiny. I earnestly hope that
China's leaders can respect and protect the people's rights to free
choice and that the universal values of freedom and democracy
will blossom in China eventually," Chen wrote in his article.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sixteen legislators from Taiwan exchanged
views with their Japanese counterparts in an annual meeting of
bilateral lawmakers Thursday and reached consensus on many issues of
mutual concern.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan lawmakers, led by opposition Kuomintang lawmaker P.K.
Chiang, meet with 50 members of the Dietmen's Alliance for Japan-ROC
Friendship, a pro-Taiwan group.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Takeo Hiranuma, who is the head of the
Dietmen's pro-Taiwan group, promised to push the Tokyo authorities to
perpetuate visa-free privileges granted to Taiwan tourists during the
duration of the Expo 2005 Aichi, and to support Taiwan's bid to join
the World Health Assembly as an observer.</P>
      <P>Citing China's deployment of missiles targeting Taiwan, its
tapping of natural gas in the East China Sea without consulting
Japan's opinion, and intrusion by Chinese submarines into Japan's
waters, the former Japanese minister of international trade and
industry condemned China for pursuing hegemony in the region.</P>
      <P>He also said Japan shares Taiwan's interest in peace across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chiang expressed thanks to Hiranuma's group, which,
he said, has contributed a great deal to the substantial exchanges
between Taiwan and Japan since the two countries broke diplomatic
ties in 1972.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has been squeezed out of many international
groups by China, Chiang said, it has come a long way in economic
development, and attaches great importance to peace in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to Japan Koh Se-kai said the annual
meeting has become a vital channel of exchange between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>He made a pitch for Taiwan's participation in the East Asian
community, claiming that it will promote regional peace. He also
urged Japan to review its "one China" policy with an eye to improving
ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang and his delegation arrived in Tokyo Wednesday for a
six-day visit.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday he is
willing to talk with Chinese President Hu Jintao but not in June or
July as had been claimed by some local media.</P>
      <P>Chatting with a group of lawmakers from his Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) at a tea party, the president was quoted as
saying that he has not forsaken the hope of peace talks with China
and would like to meet with Hu if the talks are held somewhere other
than Taiwan or China and with no other prerequisites.</P>
      <P>Chen was quoted as telling the lawmakers that Taiwan will be
half-lost if he goes to China for talks but will get a free hand in
negotiating with China if they take place elsewhere.</P>
      <P>He defended his February meeting with James Soong, chairman of
the opposition People First Party, claiming that it paved the way for
reconciliation between the ruling DPP and the opposition at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"There is nothing wrong with contacting the opposition, as long
as we stand firmly by our advocacy of Taiwan's sovereignty." Chen was
quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>He reiterated his prediction that the domestic political
landscape will change dramatically after mid-July, when a new leader
takes the reins of the main opposition Kuomintang and the
constitutional amendments crafted to reshape the legislature have
been approved by the National Assembly.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers will stop their unreasonable filibustering
at the Legislative Yuan and the ties between the executive and
legislative branches will become more stable, the president forecast.</P>
      <P>He also defended his announcement last week of tax hikes, which
has caused an outcry among taxpayers, saying it is part of his
administration's efforts to revamp the tax system.</P>

    <TEXT>Today is Friday, June 3, or the 27th
day of the fourth month of the Year of the Rooster according to the
lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events that have
occurred on this date in the past:

1839: China's Ching Commissioner Lin Tse-hsu orders the burning
of the more than 20,000 chests of opium handed in by foreign
merchants in Kwangtung, sparking the Opium War between China and the
British. Since 1930, June 3 has been observed in China as Opium
Suppression Movement Day.

1896: The Ching court and Russia sign a treaty in Moscow forming
a defensive alliance for 15 years and granting Russia the rights to
operate railways in northern Manchuria.

1899: Johann Strauss the Younger, Austrian conductor and composer
of waltzes, dies at the age of 74. He is sometimes called "the Waltz
King" and is best remembered for his numerous waltzes such as "The
Blue Danube."

1924: Austrian writer Franz Kafka dies in a sanitarium in
Kierling, near Vienna, at the age of only 40 after losing a
seven-year battle with tuberculosis. The writer, whose stories

which men are liable when in the presence of their superiors. First,
to speak out when one is not called upon to speak: that is called
being forward. Second, to keep silent when called upon to speak: that
is called being disingenuous. Third, to speak out without taking into
consideration the expression in the eyes of the person spoken to:
that is called blindness."</TEXT>

      <P>Professor Chang Kow-lung, a veteran
environmental protection activist who has been nicknamed Taiwan's
"anti-nuclear godfather, " was confirmed Friday by the Executive Yuan
as the new Environment Protection Administration (EPA) minister.</P>
      <P>Chang, formerly a political vice minister of the Ministry of

filling the vacancy created when Chang Juu-en stepped down more than
a month ago to return to his teaching career at National Cheng Kung

      <P>Chang, 68, who holds a doctoral degree in physics from Yale

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese manufacturer using Taiwan
counterpart's license to take part in Computex Taipei 2005 has had
its display booth shut down after an opposition lawmaker pointed out
the illegal practice.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Computer Association (TCA), sponsor of the world's
second largest computer exhibition, made the announcement after
Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Liao Pen-yen pointed out earlier
in the day that several Chinese manufacturers have colluded with
their Taiwan counterparts to take part in the Computex Taipei 2005,
and urged the government to deal with them rigorously according to
the law.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan company that colluded with the Chinese manufacturer
has been barred from the computer exhibition for the next two years
as a penalty, TCA officials said.</P>
      <P>Liao said that current regulations stipulate that Chinese
manufacturers can take part in local exhibitions with specific themes
if they come and go in groups. Chinese manufacturers can take part in
international exhibitions in Taipei if they pass screening by the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, he added.</P>
      <P>Three individual Chinese companies, which applied under the cover
of Taiwan manufactures, are currently attending the Computex Taipei
2005, the world's second largest computer exhibition, in total
disregard of Taiwan's regulations, Liao claimed.</P>
      <P>Liao disclosed the name of one of the Chinese company, but
withheld the names of the other two until more information is
gathered. </P>
      <P>Liao said that he is not against having Chinese manufacturers
come to Taiwan to take part in exhibitions legally, but he is opposed
to these companies undermining the rights of local manufacturers by
colluding with "rogue" Taiwan manufacturers to evade screening and
take part in the Computex Taipei 2005 at which it is difficult to get
a display booth because of high demand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Seventeen mayors from China on
Thursday rejected invitations to the United Nations' World
Environment Day (WED) 2005 activities being held June 1-5 in San
Francisco in protest against Taiwan mayors' participation in the
events.</P>
      <P>World Environment Day, while falls on June 5 each year, is one of
the principal vehicles through which the United Nations tries to
raise global awareness of the environment and enhance political
attention and action.</P>
      <P>The theme of this year's World Environment Day is "Green Cities,"
and the slogan is "Plan for the Planet." San Francisco has been
selected to host to main activities marking World Environment Day.</P>
      <P>During the five days of activities, city leaders attending the
events are expected to trade ideas on issues that will create a
better environment for people to enjoy a safer and more prosperous
future.</P>
      <P>The organizers of the WED 2005 activities, including the Bureau
of Environment of the City of San Francisco and the United Nations,
have invited a total of 250 mayors from cities around the world,
including 17 mayors from China and two mayors from Taiwan, to
participate in the activities.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tain-Tsair, mayor of Tainan City, who is attending at the
head of a delegation from the city, met with California Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom at the
opening ceremony of the activities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh Ching-chuan, deputy mayor of Taipei City, is
expected to represent Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is currently
vying for the chairmanship of the opposition Kuomintang, in
participating in some activities marking this year's WED.</P>
      <P>The 17 Chinese mayors have decided to boycott the activities
because of the invitations extended by the organizers of the
activities to the two mayors from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu said that his city's outstanding performance in
the fields of environmental and natural resources protection and in
waste management over the past few years are some of the reasons that
he was invited to attend the WED activities in San Francisco.</P>
      <P>Hsu also said that he will join the other 61 mayors attending the
activities to sign a "Green Cities Declaration" June 5.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-hua on Friday announced
his return to the main opposition Kuomintang fold after leaving the
party some 12 years ago.</P>
      <P>Lee, who quit the People First Party (PFP) May 18 because he was
disappointed by the party's cooperation with the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) initiated by PFP Chairman James Soong, who
has met with President Chen Shui-bian twice so far this year, said he
has a"feeling like coming home" at a welcome press conference
presided over by Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT
Policy Committee</P>
      <P>Lee said that he met with KMT Chairman Lien Chan two weeks ago
and that Lien extended a welcome.</P>
      <P>Lee said that during his visits to grass-roots supporters, the
people expressed the hope that he would return to the KMT. He also
said that he supports Lien's advocacy of a merger of the KMT and the
PFP as well as of cross-strait peace. All these factors contributed
to his decision to return to the party, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is serving his fifth consecutive term as a legislator,
joined the KMT in 1966 but left the party in 1994 for the New Party,
a splinter party of the KMT formed by KMT members disgruntled with
then President Lee Teng-hui's policies. He later joined the PFP in
2000.</P>
      <P>Lee is the second lawmaker to leave the PFP and return to the KMT
fold in the past two months. Legislator Chou Hsi-wei did so in April.
The PFP is still the third-largest party in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that Lee's legislator sister, Lee Ching-an, remains in
the PFP, while Legislator Chiu Yi, who recently quit the PFP, has yet
to contact the KMT.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The enterovirus outbreak in Taiwan has
entered its peak this year, with a total of 49 severe infections
reported so far, including four deaths, the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) under the Department of Health said Friday.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director General Chou Chi-hao said that among the four
deaths, three were caused by the EV71 virus, while the cause of the
fourth has yet to be determined.</P>
      <P>Chou said that EV71 virus is usually the cause of severe
enterovirus infection, but he added that three of the 49 cases are
due to the CoxB3 virus.</P>
      <P>CoxB3 virus usually hits newborns, and this is exactly the cause
of the mass infection of newborns at a hospital in Taoyuan, northern
Taiwan, Chou said.</P>
      <P>He noted that one female infant and two male infants at the
Taoyuan hospital have been infected with CoxB3 virus, and the
hospital has evacuated its infant ward to control the situation.</P>
      <P>CDC officials said that all the enterovirus victims are children
under five years old, and most of the severe infections have been
reported in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The officials urged parents to watch closely whether their
children develop any symptoms of severe illness in the five days
after the appearance of symptoms similar to those of enteroviral
infection, and if they do, to send the children to hospital
immediately.</P>
      <P>These symptoms include excessive sleepiness, decreased
responsiveness, weakness and paralysis of the extremities, muscle
pain, vomiting, fever, irritability, coma, shortness of breath, and
increased or irregular heartbeat.</P>
      <P>While the symptoms of enteroviral infections can be similar to
those of the flu, some patients may also develop blisters on their
hands, feet and mouth and even pneumonia, myocarditis and
encephalitis.</P>
      <P>As enteroviruses are transmitted via direct contact with
secretions from an infected person or contact with contaminated
surfaces or objects, practicing good personal hygiene is crucial to
preventing infections, according to the CDC.</P>

      <P>New regulations governing the inspection and
quarantine of imported cats and dogs will be put into practice from
next Monday to prevent rabies from entering Taiwan, the Bureau of
Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) under the
Council of Agriculture said Friday.</P>
      <P>Rabies affects both humans and animals. With recent reports of
rabies around the world, the bureau revised the operations governing
the inspection and quarantine of imported cats and dogs in February
this year.</P>
      <P>The new regulations stipulate that cats and dogs imported from
infected areas must have blood samples examined by certified
laboratories at least 180 days before their entry.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said that Taiwan has had no documented cases of
rabies since 1961 and urged the public to follow the regulations when
bringing cats and dogs in and out of Taiwan and not to buy animals
and related products from unidentified sources.</P>
      <P>The public were also encouraged to report smuggling activities
through the hotline 0800-039131.</P>
      <P>Rabies is an acute, infectious, often fatal viral disease of most

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese reporter Thursday witnessed
several of China's obstructions in preventing the nation's
journalists from doing their jobs and said the obstructions have made
Taiwan media face more difficulties in covering the news.</P>
      <P>Chiu Yu Tzu, a reporter of the Taipei Times, bore witness at a
press conference held by the International Society for Human Rights
(ISGHR) on the eve of 16th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square
Massacre to condemn the violence of the Beijing government's
trampling of human rights.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the United Nations for its second consecutive refusal
to allow Taiwan reporters to cover this year's annual meeting of the
World Health Assembly, the executive arm of the World Health
Organization, which was held May 6-14 in Geneva, Chiu said that
although Taiwan is a democratic country, its journalists abroad have
encountered more difficulties than their counterparts from other
countries in doing their jobs.</P>
      <P>Saying that she experienced unfair treatment from the United
Nations, which refused to allow her to cover a "U.N. Conference for
Sustainable Development" held in Johannesburg in 2002, the reporter
said that the only reason given by the U.N. was that it does not
recognize Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Describing Chiu's experience as "unbelievable, " a former
reporter of the Xinhua News Agency and Radio France International,
who was also attending the conference, said that the U.N.'s
discrimination against Taiwan journalists is an injustice that will
eventually be judged by historians and media experts in the future.</P>
      <P>Wei Jinsheng, a renowned Chinese dissident now living in the
United States, also said at the gathering that Chinese embassies in
various countries around the world still press foreign media to
report only the news that is believed to be beneficial to the Beijing
government.</P>
      <P>ISFHR spokesman Martin Lessenthin issued a statement at the press
conference saying that the freedom of discussion is a precondition of
political and economic development and that paying proper heed to
human rights can create a more stable society.</P>
      <P>He further said that the continuous obstructions of the Chinese
government in the freedom of the press and against political
dissidents can only cause resistance and instability.</P>

      <P>The president also claimed that Soong promised during the meeting
to oppose a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow for
popular referendums on future constitutional amendments in exchange
for Beijing's approval for him to visit China, the petition says.</P>
      <P>It notes that Chen has refused to apologize or offer any
explanation, despite Soong's strong protest and the National Security
Bureau's denial of having the intelligence that Chen mentioned.</P>
      <P>Soong alleged that Chen was obviously attacking his political
reputation with the unfactual account.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said the party believes it is right
to follow a path of political reconciliation with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) but that it will not tolerate the
president's defamation of an opposition leader.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-pin, convener of the PFP legislative caucus, expressed
his support for Soong's move.</P>
      <P>As to whether the incident will affect cooperation between the
PFP and the DPP, Chen said the cooperation is based on national
interests rather than partisan gain, but he stressed that such
cooperation must not be conducted at the expense of the PFP's
dignity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ker Chien-ming, head of the DPP's policy committee,
said he did not think Chen and Soong will become enemies because of
the incident.</P>
      <P>Ker said Chen and Soong share similar views on promoting
political stability and cross-Taiwan Strait reconciliation and that
there is still room for them to work together.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, expressed
regret at Soong's decision to sue the president.</P>
      <P>Lai said he hopes the PFP will continue to pursue political
reconciliation based on the spirit of a Feb. 24 Chen-Soong meeting
and cooperate with the DPP to push through priority bills during the
upcoming special legislative session.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is willing to extend its experience
and expertise in the development of agricultural economy to Chinese
farmers to help them shake off poverty, a Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's agricultural achievements are world renowned
and that Taiwan has helped Third World countries develop agriculture
for decades, MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung said Taiwan is capable
and willing to help alleviate the poverty of Chinese farmers, who
number roughly 900 million.</P>
      <P>You called for authorities of China's agricultural sector to
contact Taiwan for talks on efforts to provide timely and effective
assistance to their farmers.</P>
      <P>At a regular press meeting, he quoted United Nations and World
Bank tallies as indicating that nearly 200 million farmers in China
are unemployed without any regular income, the bane of China's
economy.</P>
      <P>About seven out of 10 people in China live in rural areas, You
said, quoting information released by the Chinese authorities as
indicating that the Chinese farmers' annual income currently averages
2,900 renminbi (US$362.5) , representing a daily income of about 8
renminbi.</P>
      <P>However, You said, according to a survey conducted by a private
group in China, the average daily income is actually less than
one-tenth of the official figure.</P>
      <P>Despite the prevailing poverty, China's farmers have to pay
various taxes, You added.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities have also announced that the unemployment
rate in the agricultural sector stood at 7 percent as of early this
year, representing about 20 million farmers are out of work, a
dubious figure compared with the figure released by the United
Nations and the World Bank of nearly 200 million, You said.</P>
      <P>Quoting a recent saying in China: "The farmers are bitter, rural
villages are poor and the agriculture sector is endangered, " You
reiterated that Taiwan, in its capacity as a member of the
international community, is more than willing to help lift China's
farmers out of poverty.</P>

years, while the age of people coming into their first contact with
narcotics has lowered, sources from the Department of Health (DOH)
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a national anti-narcotics conference, Li Jih-heng,
director-general of the DOH National Bureau of Controlled Drugs, said
that about 1,000 kg of illicit drugs were apprehended by law
enforcement authorities in 1998, a figure that had soared eight-fold
to some 8,000 kg by 2004.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Li said, the number of drug addicts checking into DOH
psychiatric centers and related institutions to get rid of addiction
has also surged from 1,000 to 12,000 people.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Taoyuan Psychiatric Center also reported at

      <P>Among all narcotics, heroin is the most difficult to kick,
according to Li, while heroin addicts are also most vulnerable to
AIDS infection.</P>
      <P>To help these addicts get rid of their habit, the DOH has decided
to choose 50 heroin addicts who are also HIV positive to be

    <HEADLINE>APEC ATTENDANCE IRRELEVANT TO CHEN-HU MEETING: PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's desire to attend
the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum has nothing to do with the proposal of a meeting between him
and Chinese President Hu Jintao, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chou Chun-ying, deputy director of the Presidential Office's
Public Affairs Department, was responding to a media report that Chen
is striving to attend the 2005 APEC informal leadership meeting to be
held in South Korea later this year so that he can meet with Hu on
that international occasion.</P>
      <P>The 21-member APEC forum is one of the few major international
organizations that admit both Taiwan and China. Because of China's
opposition, Taiwan's top leader has been barred from attending the
annual APEC informal leadership meeting in person and has to name a
proxy to attend on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Chou said, the Presidential Office has always
hoped that Chen can attend the APEC summit in person. However, she
went on, such a desire is completely irrelevant to the proposal for a
summit meeting across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>If Chen is able to attend the APEC summit, Chou said, he would
interact with his counterparts from all APEC member economies, not
just with the top leader from any specific member economy.</P>
      <P>As to the topics of a cross-strait summit, Chou noted that this
is another issue entirely.</P>
      <P>Chen was quoted as having said during a tea party with a group of
lawmakers from his ruling Democratic Progressive Party Thursday that
he is willing to talk with Hu but not in June or July as had been
claimed by some local media.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he has not forsaken the hope of peace talks
with China and would like to meet with Hu if the talks are held
somewhere other than Taiwan or China, on an equal footing and with no
prerequisites other than those.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said Taiwan would be half-lost if he were to go
to China for talks but would get a free hand in negotiating with
China if the talks were to take place elsewhere.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper speculated that Chen's "third place" proposal
refers to the APEC meeting scheduled for late this year in South
Korea, but Chou dismissed the speculation as "off base."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
that whether a Chen-Hu meeting can become a reality hinges on China's
attitude.</P>
      <P>For years, MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung said, the DPP
administration has on numerous occasions extended olive branches in
an effort to push for cross-strait "goodwill reconciliation, active
cooperation and permanent peace."</P>
      <P>Noting that the longstanding disputes across the Taiwan Strait
could have profound impact, You said the two sides should have
meaningful dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving all
those critical disputes.</P>
      <P>In the pursuit of cross-strait peaceful development, You said,
the MAC and other relevant government agencies have made extensive
preparations for cross-strait talks. However, he went on, it takes
two to tango and high-level cross-strait talks will take place only
when China shows interest or willingness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW STRAITS EXCHANGE FOUNDATION HEAD RECOMMENDED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh recommended Friday Chang
Chun-hsiung, a former premier and former secretary-general of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, as chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , which handles daily affairs in Taiwan's
exchanges with China in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) spokesman Yu Ying-lung said the
naming will strengthen the government's "rapprochement- and
cooperation-oriented" China policy because Chang has long called for
"cooperation rather than confrontation" with China.</P>
      <P>Yu said Chang is the "best choice" for the critical and symbolic
post.</P>
      <P>The post has been vacant since the death of Koo Chen-fu Jan. 3.
It had long been rumored that President Chen Shui-bian wanted Chang
to take over the post and Hsieh finally made it official, as the SEF
board is to meet next week to formally endorse Hsieh's
recommendation.</P>
      <P>Chang, 67, graduated from National Taiwan University with a law
degree. After becoming a lawyer, he joined the legal corps defending
opposition activists arrested during the 1979 Formosa Magazine
incident. He then entered politics, serving as an opposition lawmaker
for 17 years.</P>
      <P>During the 2000 presidential election, Chang served as DPP
candidate Chen Shui-bian's campaign manager. After winning the
election, he worked as deputy premier, premier and the president's
secretary-general before becoming the DPP's secretary-general. He is
currently a senior adviser to the president.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, DPP legislative caucus secretary-general, said
that with his rich political experience, Chang will be able to win
the trust of the people in Taiwan and protect Taiwan's interests in
the handling of cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said it expects Chang to
"shed his ideology" and do more in promoting pragmatic exchanges with
China.</P>
      <P>Chen Chieh, secretary-general of the KMT's legislative caucus,
said that during his time as premier, Chang did not made too many
pro-Taiwan independence statements and that the party hopes "he will
promote cross-strait exchanges and not be bound by his party's
ideology."</P>
      <P>However, KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen accused Chang's appointment
of being "political cronyism" as he does not have any special
knowledge or experience or even interest in cross-strait affairs and
therefore will not help improve Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) said it does not expect
too much from Chang on the grounds that it is Chen who makes China
policy and who must explain it in clear terms.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-pin, convener of the PFP's legislative caucus, said
that if the president does not explain clearly to the people his
China policy, "it does not matter who is in charge of the Straits
Exchange Foundation" because cross-strait relations simply will not
change.</P>
      <P>The minor opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union's secretary-general,
Chen Chien-ming, expressed hope that Chang will be able to "reopen
the door of negotiation" between the SEF and its Chinese counterpart,
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>

gymnasts undergoing gruelling training made more than NT$2.5 million
(US$79,365) at the box office because of good reviews. Another
documentary film "Let it Be" depicting the lives of rice farmers also
made more than NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>"The Wayward Cloud," an award-winning film at the Berlin Festival
this year, also set a box office record of more than NT$20 million,
Yao added.</P>
      <P>He praised Lin for his measures and policy of assisting domestic
film workers when he was GIO head.</P>
      <P>Lin for his part said there is a national movie center in
northern Taiwan, but it mainly collects feature films, while the
central museum will focus on collecting documentary films.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF TO SEEK CROSS-STRAIT RAPPROCHEMENT: PROSPECTIVE SEF HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The prospective new chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Chang Chun-hsiung, said
Friday that the government's China policy will focus on maintaining
Taiwan's identity and seeking rapprochement and symbiosis with China.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh formally recommended Chang as SEF chairman to
replace Dr. Koo Chen-fu, who died in January. The recommendation is
expected to win approval next week from the board of directors of the
SEF, the quasi-official body that handles day-to-day cross-Taiwan
Strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Chang immediately pledged that he will show his utmost sincerity
and patience in seeking to resume cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>He said it is a great pity that the governments on the two sides
of the strait are currently stuck in a squabble over the definition
of the so-called "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>He said the "1992 consensus" comes from the Hong Kong
negotiations of that year, which he claimed resulted in both parties
agreeing not to deal with controversial issues but to respect each
other and talk about ways and means of solving practical problems.</P>
      <P>"If the two sides can try to solve all issues based on that 'Hong
Kong spirit, ' I believe it will be a good start (to a resumption of
dialogue)," he told a press conference.</P>
      <P>Turning to domestic squabbles over the direction of Taiwan's
China policy, Chang said a consensus needs to be reached for the sake
of national interest, as consensus is the "most critical support" of
policy.</P>
      <P>The success of the SEF depends on reconciliation between the
ruling and opposition parties as well as the consensus of the people,
he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he recommended Chang because the government wants to
usher in a new era for cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chang has rich experience in politics; he knows political changes
and cross-strait relations well; further, he knows President Chen
Shui-bian's basic stance with regard to China, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He said he expects Chang, with his wide experience and moderate
style, to open up a new situation and work for the well-being of the
people on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Observers said Chang has always been a "vanguard" in the
governing team, sometimes acting as a firefighter but more often as a
moderator.</P>
      <P>His appointment to the SEF position is an indication that Chen
wants to have direct dialogue with China's top leader, and Chang will
play the role of "ice breaker" in that regard, according to the
observers.</P>

      <P>The value of Taiwan's information technology
(IT) service market reached NT$58.1 billion (US$1.8 billion) last
year, according to statistics compiled by the International Data

      <P>Tsao Yung-hui, a Taiwanese analyst at the IDC, noted that the

      <P>Although the market for software maintenance is stable, profits
are dropping, with the market for system integration in big

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILL NOT BE ABSENT FROM `GLOBAL CHINESE LANGUAGE FEVER': OCAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will do its best to play a leadership
role in promoting Chinese language and culture around the world,
Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC) Chairwoman Chang Fu-mei
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in a speech at the opening of the 4th
International Conference on Internet Chinese Education being held at
the National Taiwan Science Education Center through Sunday.</P>
      <P>Describing that the traditional characters used in Taiwan as the
"orthodox" writing form of Chinese, Chang expressed her hope of
helping the people of Taiwan and those in the rest of the world to
gain a better understanding of what she claimed is "a Chinese fever
sweeping the entire world."</P>
      <P>Chang dismissed a recent media report that China has gained the
upper hand over Taiwan in the global advocacy of Chinese language,
saying that Taiwan's digital technology is far above China's levels
and that the OCAC will also kick off various programs to lure more
Chinese learners.</P>
      <P>She also denied that the United States has shifted from Taiwan's
traditional characters to China's simplified characters, claiming
that the information is incorrect.</P>
      <P>According to a recent newspaper report, China is attracting
increasing numbers of foreign Chinese learning students with its use
of simplified characters and a strong cultural promotion campaign --
setting up more than 100 "Confucius institutes" worldwide.</P>
      <P>The OCAC chairwoman said her council has been preparing to launch
various e-learning programs on its Web site in the hope of creating a
network of 3,600 Chinese language-teaching centers around the world.</P>
      <P>Quoting a recent report by Newsweek, around 2,400 high schools in
the United States will begin opening Chinese classes in 2007, she
said, adding that this is a clear indication that Chinese language
and culture will be incorporated into the U. S. higher and secondary
education systems, as a large number of U.S. colleges and
universities will also open Chinese courses from 2006.</P>
      <P>To catch up with the new trend, the OCAC and the Ministry of
Education will jointly generate US$300,000 to help finance a project
to create teaching materials and related matters, she said, noting
that relevant government agencies have agreed to consolidate
resources and policymaking mechanisms to make Taiwan a global hub and
think tank for Chinese language teaching and learning.</P>
      <P>The Global Chinese Language and Culture Center run by the OCAC
provides an E-school for Chinese teaching and learning through the
Internet, she said. In the future, the E-school will be developed
into a portal and platform responsible for online enrollment,
learning, testing and certification for overseas Chinese and
foreigners, she explained.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that Taiwan is determined to play a constructive role
in the Chinese learning enthusiasm worldwide, she said that the
government has been assisting more than 3,000 Chinese schools
offshore and has been maintaining close links with about 1,800 of
them.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope of turning the 1,800 Chinese schools
abroad into the OCAC's strongholds abroad, where Chinese learners can
enjoy high-quality software and hardware facilities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, domestic and foreign experts are slated to make public
a total of 85 papers at the three-day conference on building a
digital environment for Chinese learning and teaching through
e-learning.</P>

      <P>MOEA officials noted that representatives will be divided into
several divisions, including market access, service and investments,
as well as legal review of regulations.</P>
      <P>The two sides are expected to focus on topics that were not
agreed upon at the second round of talks, including national
treatment, rule of origin, dispute settlements, safeguard measures,
unfair trade measures, and technical trade barriers.</P>

at the third round of negotiations in regulations, the list of
agricultural and industrial products that may enjoy tariff cuts, the
negative list for the opening of the service industry, aviation and
marine transport agreements, and the rule of origin.</P>
      <P>The officials expressed hope that the free trade agreement can be
signed before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first FTA was signed with Panama, with the pact coming

      <P>The two-day event drew more than 300 educators from Taiwan,

      <P>Addressing the opening of the conference, NYUST President Lin
Tsong-ming said globalization is the trend of the 21st century and
that technological and vocational education should also follow this
trend.</P>
      <P>Lin proposed that educational institutions in Taiwan and
Southeast Asia enhance their academic exchanges and promote
multi-dimensional cooperation.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Kuo-pao, head of the Department of
Technological and Vocational Education under the Ministry of

collaboration and international exchanges.</P>
      <P>The ministry will hold exhibitions on technological and

      <P>In a keynote speech on technological talent in Taiwan's high-tech
firms, Chang Ping-heng, a human resources official at the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., pointed out that Taiwan has faced
manpower shortages in recent years because students are interested
only in getting academic degrees rather than pursuing academic
quality.</P>
      <P>To cope with the demand of corporations, personnel should be
well-trained in terms of their linguistic ability, international
perspective, professional skills, emotional management and
communicative ability, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Topics on the agenda of the conference include faculty and
student exchanges, mutual curriculum accreditation, development and
accreditation of Internet curricula and instruction, and
international research collaboration.</P>

      <P>Former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary
of State Randall Shriver said Thursday he is scheduled to visit
Taiwan in July and will meet with ROC President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Shriver made the remarks while meeting with a group of
journalists from Taiwan. The press group, headed by Mainland Affairs
Council Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng, discussed with Shriver issues
regarding relations across the Taiwan Strait and
Taiwan-U.S.-China relations.</P>
      <P>Shriver, who just stepped down as deputy assistant secretary of
state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, said he had met with
President Chen on many occasions in the past few years. Shriver said
he believes that Chen fully understands the cross-strait
situation.</P>
      <P>When he visits Taiwan in July, Shriver said he would not take the
initiative to offer any advice about cross-strait issues. "But if
President Chen asks me, I would take pleasure in offering my own
opinions," he added.</P>
      <P>Touching on the meeting in September between U.S. President
George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao, Shriver said he
believes they will focus their discussions on U.S.-China trade and
the North Korean issue. Shriver said he doesn't think anything new
regarding the Taiwan issue will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Shriver further said although China shows some "creativity" in
dealing with the Taiwan issue, it has so far not demonstrated any
"flexibility" in its stance. Since both the United States and
China have their own fundamental stances, Shriver said, they are
unlikely to come up with any new overture about the Taiwan issue.</P>

seek rapprochement with opposition parties.</P>
      <P>However, Yu would not comment on opposition People First Party

      <P>Yu said the president has many sources of information; when he
made that statement, he did not mean to hurt anybody or make anybody

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RANKS FIFTH IN BERI'S INVESTMENT CLIMATE EVALUATION FOR 2005</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's investment environment was ranked
fifth among 50 major economies by the Swiss-based Business
Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) market research firm in its 2005
investment climate risk evaluation report.</P>
      <P>Citing BERI statistics, officials of the Ministry of Economic
Affairs said Taiwan's investment climate ranking was behind that of
Switzerland, Singapore, the Netherlands and Japan. In Asia, the
island enjoyed the third-best investment climate, only after
Singapore and Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was classified at the 1A category as a country with low
risk for investments.</P>
      <P>BERI evaluates a country's investment climate based on three
major indicators -- business risk index, political risk index and
currency exchange risk index.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's business risk index and currency exchange risk index
remained at last year's level -- both at third place; however, its
political risk index dropped two places to 15th in this year's
evaluation.</P>
      <P>BERI considered Taiwan's business risk as stable, suggesting that
the island may improve its image in the world community by continuing
its reform programs.</P>
      <P>Regarding the currency exchange risk index, BERI hailed Taiwan's
progress in the legal structure governing foreign exchange reserves
and the island's ability to earn these reserves.</P>
      <P>The Swiss company also classified Taiwan's political risk as
stable, predicting that there will be no military conflicts between
the two sides of Taiwan Strait before 2008.</P>
      <P>Although China enacted the Anti-Secession Law with Taiwan as its
target, which caused some concern, in fact it might turn out to be a
turning point for the island, BERI experts noted, estimating that
cross-strait relations will improve over the next five years.</P>
      <P>BERI experts concluded that Taiwan political risk dropped due
largely to the political struggles among different parties within the
country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the BERI report, Taiwan can claim the
third-best workforce in the world, only after that of Singapore and
the United States, as the attitude of its laborers, skill level,
labor regulations and relative productivity all scored high.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. COULD BE BEST BRIDGE FOR CROSS-STRAIT SUMMIT: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday he
thinks that the United States probably could be the best bridge and
platform for an historic meeting between the top leaders from both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with New York Times Chairman
Arthur O. Sulzberger, Jr., who is currently on a three-day visit in
Taiwan at the invitation of the United Daily News Group.</P>
      <P>Even though the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have different
political systems and lifestyles, Chen said he is more than willing
to develop contacts, dialogue and consultations with China.
Nevertheless, he stressed that cross-strait talks should be conducted
without violation of the principles of "sovereignty, dignity,
security and popular wellbeing."</P>
      <P>Chen further said he looks forward to an historic handshake and
peace talks with the Chinese leader on an equal footing and with no
preconditions.</P>
      <P>"I hope this 'first meeting' can take place in a third country
and the United States could probably be the best bridge and platform
for such a rendezvous," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Touching on the recent China visits by two Taiwan opposition
leaders -- Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party
Chairman James Soong, Chen said he didn't think that their visits
could help pave the way for him to visit the mainland.</P>
      <P>"In reality, I took their visits as a litmus test for the
Chinese leadership's sincerity toward improving cross-strait
relations. My observation is that the Chinese leader didn't make any
concessions. Even so, I would not forsake the hope of forging
cross-strait rapprochement and dialogue while insisting on Taiwan's
separate identity," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president further said he feels regret that China didn't
seize the "window of opportunity" for cross-strait detente when he
first came to power in 2000.</P>
      <P>"I believe that the years of 2005 and 2006 could be another
'window of opportunity' for improving cross-strait ties. If China
misses it, the next such opportunity is not expected to come until
after 2008 or even 2010," he claimed.</P>
      <P>While he is willing to talk with Chinese President Hu Jintao in a
third country with no political strings or preconditions, Chen said
he doesn't expect that the first such meeting would result in a
conclusion to longstanding cross-strait disputes.</P>
      <P>"I believe it would take time to work out a viable solution. We
may need many rounds of difficult talks to find a solution, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>In U.S. President George W. Bush's telephone conversations with
Hu on May 5, Bush urged Hu to hold talks with Taiwan's duly-elected
leader, referring to President Chen. Chen said he looks forward to
such a moment.</P>
      <P>As the top national leader, Chen said, he is obligated to defend
Taiwan's sovereignty and protect the country from being invaded or
annexed. While China addresses the sovereignty issue from the Chinese
nationalistic perspective, Chen said his administration is dealing
with the issue based on the principle of democracy. His belief is
that Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to its 23 million people. Against
this backdrop, Chen said he doesn't think the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait can resolve this dispute any time soon. Therefore, he said, a
Chen-Hu meeting could take place only if both sides agree to talk
without any political string or prerequisites.</P>
      <P>For his part, Sulzberger said if a Chen-Hu meeting indeed takes
place, it would certainly make headlines around the world.
Sulzberger presented a collection of New York Times news clippings
regarding the 911 terrorist attacks to Chen as a gift.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Regulations governing orders for outbound
processing within Taiwan's free trade habor zones have been relaxed
to attract more international distribution and logistics businesses
to set up operational lines there, an official of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Under the Statute Governing the Establishment and Management of
Free Trade Habor Zones, only two sectors in the compounds --
manufacturing and processing -- are currently permitted to place
orders on manufacturers or processors outside the zones.</P>
      <P>However, according to some corporate sources, the official said,
logistics and transportation sectors are also expected to open
operational lines in the free trade zones in the future.</P>
      <P>If the zones want international logistics enterprises to move in,
they should give the businesses the right to seek outbound processors
to allow them enjoying sufficient sources of supplies, corporate
sources have suggested.</P>
      <P>Vice CEPD Chairman Thomas M.F. Yeh indicated that regulations
were changed to allow non-manufacturing and processing businesses in
the free trade zones to file orders to outbound processors. If their
ordered products are transported back to the free trade zones in six
months after the order is released, the goods are tax free, he noted.</P>
      <P>There are currently free-trade zones operating in Keelung,
Taoyuan and Kaohsiung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSH'S COMMITMENT TO TAIWAN'S DEFENSE UNCHANGED: FORMER U.S. OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S President George W. Bush's 2001
promise that he will do whatever it takes to defend Taiwan remains
unchanged, former U.S Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs Randall G. Schriver said Friday.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with a group of journalists from Taiwan,
Schriver said Washington tried through both private and public
channels to dissuade China from enacting its Anti-Secession Law early
this year, calling it a wrong step unhelpful for China's ties with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The backlash the law produced in the international community has
born out Washington's prediction, and the European Union has
therefore postponed a decision to lift an arms embargo against China,
Schriver went on.</P>
      <P>He denied that Washington's response to China's enactment of the
law was not as harsh as its anger over Taiwan's first national
referendum in 2004, claiming that the United States was unable to
frame its response to China's Anti-Secession Law before China made
public its contents.</P>
      <P>He dismissed concerns that the U.S. might withdraw its offer to
sell a package of arms to Taiwan if Taiwan's opposition parties keep
blocking passage of the budget for it, but warned that the
foot-dragging might drive up the price of the weapons because of arms
manufacturers' cost in re-launching their production lines.</P>
      <P>When Taiwan criticizes the United States for what it felt was a
weak response by Washington to China's enactment of the Anti-Secession
Law, it should ask itself why it drags its feet on clinching the arms
sale, Schriver said.</P>
      <P>Schriver said he is not certain whether Chinese President Hu
Jintao is amenable to the idea mulled by his predecessor Jiang Zemin
of withdrawing its missiles targeting Taiwan in exchange for a U.S.
promise to stop arms sales to Taiwan, but Washington's position on
this issue is very clear: Such an offer should be made to Taiwan
rather than to the United States, as would be Beijing's offer to
build a military mutual-trust mechanism.</P>
      <P>He dismissed the idea that China is more flexible now toward
Taiwan, pointing out that Beijing hasn't stopped trying to win over
Taiwan's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>But he admitted that Beijing has been more creative in engaging
Taiwan, citing its contacts with two of Taiwan's opposition parties
as an example.</P>
      <P>He also warned Taiwan to guard against China's trick of calling
Taiwan a troublemaker while casting itself as a troubleshooter who
bends over backwards to maintain peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Schriver suggested that Taiwan enhance its international profile
by contributing generously to international relief operations and
supporting the U.S. battle against terrorism rather than offering
grants to other countries in exchange for their diplomatic
recognition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VIGIL HELD TO MARK 16TH ANNIVERSARY OF TIANANMEN MASSACRE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Foundation for Democracy
organized a vigil and seminar Friday to mark the 16th anniversary of
the Tiananmen Square Massacre in which Chinese troops crushed a
pro-democracy demonstration in Beijing on June 4, 1989.</P>
      <P>Addressing the seminar, Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989
pro-democracy demonstration at Beijing's Tiananmen Square, who was
forced into exile in the United States after having been jailed for
several years in the wake of the massacre, said he hopes the June 4
tragedy can be portrayed in its real light.</P>
      <P>"I also hope that the spirits of those who were killed in the
notorious Tiananmen Massacre can find rest in heaven, and that China
can move toward democratic reforms and permanent peace will prevail
across the Taiwan Strait, " said Wang, who traveled from the United
States to attend the seminar.</P>
      <P>Wang said he believes that unless the names of the Tiananmen
Massacre victims are cleared, China's democratization cannot get
started.</P>
      <P>"Only when China is democratized, can cross-strait peace be
achieved," Wang added.</P>
      <P>He also urged Taiwan people to continue supporting democratic
development in China because "when your neighbors are not free, you
can't enjoy real freedom."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FREEDOM OF PRESS MORE VALUABLE THAN NATIONAL SECURITY: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Press freedoms are more valuable than
national security, President Chen Shui-bian said Friday in a meeting
with Arthur O. Sulzberger, Jr., the publisher of the New York Times.</P>
      <P>The president said newspapers are politicians' mirrors, and while
their stories might not always be palatable, politicians have to
accept them humbly.</P>
      <P>The more closely the media keeps its eye on politicians, and the
more scathingly are the criticisms, the better work lawmakers do,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>When it comes to press freedoms, Chen said it is better to err on
the side of accommodating them too much than too little.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 16th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square
Massacre in which the Chinese military put down a student-led
pro-democracy demonstration with force will fall on Saturday, the
president said China's human record has not shown any improvement and
this was proved by the European Union's recent decision to maintain
its arms embargo against China.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the president said, the Beijing authorities arrested
a New York Times' Beijing correspondent last September and a
Singapore Straits Times' correspondent in April, both on the vague
charge of espionage.</P>
      <P>The president said he is pleased that Taiwan, along with the
United States and other advanced countries, was considered to have
good press freedoms and ranked 44th among 194 countries by the New
York-based Liberty House in May, far ahead of China, which came in at
177th place.</P>
      <P>The president said he himself was a publisher before he entered
into politics and was known as a vociferous defender of the freedom
of the press when he worked as a lawyer, but he paid dearly for his
fight and had to spend eight months behind bars.</P>
      <P>The president said the experience convinced him that press
freedoms are more valuable than national security.</P>
      <P>Sulzberger arrived in Taipei Thursday at the invitation of a
local newspaper, the United Daily News, for a three-day visit. He is
scheduled to leave on Saturday.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum holds its annual summit in Busan, South Korea in
November it will be agood opportunity for President Chen Shui-bian to
meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao on the sidelines, Vice
President Annette Lu said Friday.</P>
      <P>Echoing the president's claim the previous day that any meeting
between himself and Hu should be held in a place other than China or
Taiwan, Lu said Busan would be an ideal place, if Chen could take
part in the APEC summit in person.</P>
      <P>Because of China's reluctance to rub shoulders with Taiwan
leaders, the Republic of China (ROC) president has in the past been
forced to refrain from participating in the summit. The ROC has
traditionally had a senior official attend the summit.</P>
      <P>Besides, the vice president said, China still has to accept
Chen's prerequisite for such a meeting, which is that the ROC is a
sovereign state owned by its 23 million people who have the final say
in deciding the country's future.</P>

calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred

American Revolution in 1776.

1928: Chang Tso-lin, leader of the Fengtien army in China's
northeast (Manchuria), is killed by a bomb on a train at Wangkutun
near Mukden (Shenyang). His son, Chang Hsueh-liang, succeeds him as
the ruler of Manchuria.

1940: A flotilla of naval and civilian craft complete the safe

Taipei 2001 -- kicks off at the Taipei World Trade Center, attracting
a record high of 1,071 firms from home and abroad to take part in the

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three things which a man
should beware of in the three stages of his life. In youth, when the
constitution of his body is not yet formed, he should beware of lust.
In manhood, when his physical powers are in full vigor, he should
beware of strife. In old age, when the physical powers are in decay,
he should beware of greed."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TAINAN MAYOR CONTINUES TO ATTEND WED EVENTS DESPITE CHINA'S PROTEST</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair said
Friday that he will continue to participate in the United Nations'
World Environment Day (WED) activities despite China's protest
against his presence at the events.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who is attending the June 1-5 WED activities in San
Francisco at the head of a delegation from his city, made the remarks
in response to a statement by the China consulate that
representatives from Chinese cities will boycott the activities.</P>
      <P>The statement said that Chinese city representatives will not
attend WED activities since the host city has not dealt appropriately
with matters regarding Taiwan city mayors' participation.</P>
      <P>Seventeen mayors from China who were invited to participate
decided to boycott the events because of the invitations extended by
the organizers to Hsu and to Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Yeh ching-chuan, the deputy mayor of Taipei City, is expected to
represent Ma, who is currently vying for the chairmanship of the
opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Saying that he and his city delegation's presence at the event
has nothing to do with politics, Hsu pointed out that environmental
protection is a universal value and that it is his city's
"outstanding performance" in the field that led to the invitation
from the organizers, which include the United Nations and the Bureau
of Environment of the City of San Francisco.</P>
      <P>Commenting on China's protest, Hsu said it is not wise for China
to do such things. "We just want to attend WED activities and
exchange views with mayors from other countries, " he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom expressed regret that
mayors from both sides of the Taiwan Strait are unable to jointly
attend the events and said the WED activities are issues among cities
and that he has no authority to deal with affairs related to
international relations.</P>
      <P>WED, which falls on June 5 each year, is one of the principal
vehicles through which the United Nations tries to raise global
awareness of the environment and enhance political attention and
action.</P>
      <P>The theme of this year's WED is "Green cities, " and the slogan
is "Plan for the Plant."</P>
      <P>During the five-day activities, city leaders are expected to
trade ideas on issues that will create a better environment. They
will also sign a "Green cities Declaration" June 5.</P>

      <P>It is the first time Taiwan has sponsored the international

      <P>The conference will be attended by business and environmental

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER HOPES FOR POLITICAL HARMONY IN ADDRESS AT NTU CAMPUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday that he
hopes there will be a joint effort to push for harmonious interaction
between the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks while addressing a National Taiwan
University (NTU) graduation ceremony. He was invited to be present as
an alumnus of the school.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jing-pyng took part in the
ceremony as father of an NTU graduate.</P>
      <P>The premier said that NTU has cultivated numerous distinguished
leaders and experts in a wide range of fields since its founding in
1928. Its alumni include former and incumbent presidents, Lee
Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian, as well as Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Even opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou, who also serves as the KMT vice chairman and is vying for
the chairmanship, were NTU graduates, he noted.</P>
      <P>"I think I should consider seeking the assistance of the NTU
presidet or the NTU alumni association in resolving inter-party rifts
in the future," Hsieh said. </P>

    <HEADLINE>NO NUKES ASIA FORUM BEGINS IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "No Nuke Asia Forum 2005" continued
Saturday in Taipei, with participants from around the world
exchanging opinions on the development of renewable energy and the
anti-nuclear campaigns in their countries.</P>
      <P>The forum from June 2-8, organized by the Taiwan Environmental
Protection Union (TEPU) , has attracted representatives of
environmental protection groups from Japan, South Korea, the
Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Australia, Germany,
Netherlands, Russia and the United States.</P>
      <P>The participants visited several nuclear plants Friday and had
talks with residents near the plants.</P>
      <P>TEPU Chairman Shih Shin-min noted that the Cabinet convened a
national energy conference in 1998, setting a goal that renewable
energy should account for 1 percent to 3 percent of the country's
total energy capacity. At that time, the government did not have the
idea of promoting a nuclear-free country.</P>
      <P>In 2003, the government began anti-nuclear campaigns, setting its
new goal in which renewable energy should account for 10 percent of
the total by 2010.</P>
      <P>Expressing hope that the government can fulfill its promise, Shih
complained that even the 10 percent goal will still lag behind that
of advanced countries.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of Denmark, which has efficiently developed
renewable energy such as hydro, wind, geothermal and biomass power,
Shih noted that the European country's renewable energy accounts for
40 percent of its total.</P>
      <P>With the Kyoto Protocol taking effect in February, which aims to
limit the global emission of greenhouse gases, the European Union
hopes that renewable energy can account for 22 percent of each
country's total by 2020.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan can only reach 12 percent goal by that time, Shih
added.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, Taiwan has been promoting hydro, wind, solar,
geothermal and biomass power, but with low efficiency.</P>
      <P>He urged the government and the people to show more concern for
the environment and to focus on renewable energy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LOOKS FORWARD TO CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE:  AIDE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian looks forward to
dialogue and consultations between the leaders on the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, the president's chief of staff said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the president, made the remarks
while attending the opening ceremony of an agricultural product show
at the plaza in front of the Presidential Office. </P>
      <P>Asked whether the United States will play the role of a bridge in
cross-strait dialogue, Yu said Taiwan has not discussed the matter
with the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen said Friday during a meeting with New York Times Chairman
Arthur Sulzberger that the United States is probably the best bridge
and platform for a historic meeting between the leaders on either
side of the strait.</P>
      <P>Yu noted that since Chen assumed office in 2000, he has continued
to extend a series of olive branches to the other side of the strait,
hoping for a cross-strait reconciliation to promote peace in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, Yu said, Beijing has failed to seize these
opportunities over the past five years and Taiwan has yet to see
China willing to come to the negotiating table.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as the ad hoc National Assembly will vote on a
constitutional amendment package June 7, Yu also said that if the
National Assembly invites Chen to the conference, the president will

      <P>Taiwan had more than 64,000 volunteers in
2004, with women accounting for 70 percent, the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Since the Volunteer Service Law was promulgated January 2001, the
governments of all special municipalities, cities and counties around
the country have been required to form social welfare volunteer
service corps.</P>
      <P>At the end of 2004, MOI officials said, there were 1,169
volunteer service corps, up 17.1 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>In terms of numbers, the service corps had a total of 64,822
volunteers, marking a 10.5 percent increase from the 2003 level.</P>
      <P>On average, each volunteer worked 1.6 hours in two installments

      <P>Female volunteers far outnumbered their male counterparts, 70
percent to 30 percent. In terms of education, graduates of senior

    <HEADLINE>CHEN-HU MEETING IN U.S. AN EXPECTATION OF ILLUSION: KMT SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's wishes for a
meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao in the United States will
not come true, a spokesman of opposition Kuomintang claimed Saturday.</P>
      <P>The president said Friday that 2005 and 2006 might be another
"window of opportunity" for holding cross-Taiwan Strait talks and
that if both sides miss that opportunity they might have to await
until 2008 or even after 2010 to hold negotiations. He expressed the
hope that he and Hu's first contact can be made in a "third country"
and said the United States would serve as the best bridge and
platform for such contact.</P>
      <P>But Chang, who is also director of the KMT's Department for
Mainland Affairs, claimed while responding to media question that
both Taipei and Beijing can create opportunities for resuming talks
at any time. He further claimed that "nobody knows" why Chen chose
2005 and 2006 as the best time to hold talks with China.</P>
      <P>"President Chen has said about 20 times that cross-strait leaders
should hold talks, but to no avail, " he added.</P>
      <P>Chen has said three times that he and Hu can meet with each other
in a third place after KMT Chairman Lien Chan's China visit, and this
time he clearly pointed to the United States as the place for his
first contact with his Chinese counterpart, the spokesman said,
claiming that Chen's purpose is to show that "he and the United
States are bound together closely" rather than promoting a meeting
with Hu.</P>
      <P>At Hu's invitation, Lien visited China from April 26 to May 3.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government is well aware of the Beijing government's
policy and bottom line and will not help arrange Chen to meet with Hu
in the United States, since they know such an arrangement would be
rejected by China, Chang speculated.</P>
      <P>Commenting on what he described as Chen's current "soft" attitude
in dealing with cross-strait issues, the spokesman claimed it is
society's hopes for better relations between the two sides of the
strait since Lien's visit that has pressed the president to keep a
low key.</P>
      <P>He further speculated that Washington's stance of encouraging
Chen to work on improving relations with Beijing is also a factor
that has made the president keep a low profile.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that fierce opposition by the fundamentalists in
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its ally the Taiwan
Solidarity Union to a visit to China by Chen is behind the
president's wish for a meeting in a third place.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU SUPPORTS HIKE IN DEFENSE SPENDING TO 3% OF GDP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
lawmaker expressed his support Saturday for a proposal to increase
the country's annual defense spending to 3 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, deputy convener of the TSU legislative caucus and a
member of the legislature's National Defense Committee, pointed out
that Taiwan's annual defense spending now accounts for 2.4 percent of
GDP, which he said is lower than the 4-5 percent of Japan, the United
States and European Union nations.</P>
      <P>Ho said it is unreasonable that Taiwan is spending less on
defense when it is facing the military threat from China.</P>
      <P>By raising the ratio of defense spending, the government will be
able to show the world its resolve to defend Taiwan and will
facilitate the passage of its NT$480 billion (US$15.33 billion) arms
procurement package from the United States, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Objecting to the Cabinet's plan to finance the procurement by a
special budget, lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
People First Party (PFP) have proposed hiking the defense spending
ratio in the hope that the arms procurement package can be
accommodated in the government's annual budget.</P>
      <P>Items in the package include a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft, six Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries and eight
diesel-electric submarines.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP, which between them enjoy a slim majority in the
legislature, have blocked the special budget proposal for the
procurement package for two legislative sessions, mainly because of
disagreement with the Cabinet over the budgeting method and the
amount of the procurement.</P>
      <P>Concerned about the progress of the procurement, Douglas Paal,
director of the Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan,
has invited co-conveners and certain members of the legislature's
National Defense Committee for a gathering June 9.</P>
      <P>However, only Lee Wen-chung from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , one of the co-conveners, and committee
member Shen Fa-hui, also from the DPP, have accepted the invitation
so far.</P>
      <P>Lu Shiow-yen, a co-convener from the KMT, said she will consult
her supporters' opinions before deciding whether to attend, while Lin
Yu-fang, a co-convener from the PFP, said he has turned down the
invitation to "avoid causing any misunderstanding." He did not
elaborate.</P>
      <P>Ho from the TSU, meanwhile, said he will not attend the gathering
because his party has already offered firm support for the arms
procurement package.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan will meet the party's National Assembly delegates Monday to give
them moral support and demonstrate the party's determination to
pursue constitutional reforms, according to Tseng Yung-chuan,
executive director of the KMT's central policy coordination
committee.</P>
      <P>The presidium of the ad hoc National Assembly has decided to
allow for representatives of each political party to explain their
respective positions concerning constitutional amendments June 6.</P>
      <P>On June 7, the assembly will vote on the package of
constitutional amendment proposals passed by the legislature last
August, which include reducing the number of seats in the legislature
from 225 to 113, extending the tenure of legislators from three years
to four years, adopting a "single seat, two ballots" legislative
electoral system, phasing out the National Assembly to allow for
popular referendums on future constitutional amendments, and
empowering the Council of Grand Justices to screen presidential and
vice presidential impeachment proposals.</P>
      <P>Both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the KMT are in
favor of the package of amendment proposals. However, the package can
only be approved if they are supported by three-quarters of the total
delegates.</P>
      <P>The DPP won the lion's share of the votes in the May 14 National
Assembly election, gaining 42.52 percent of the ballots, or 127 out
of the total 300 seats, while the KMT garnered 38.92 percent of the
votes, or 117 seats. Three other pro-reform parties won another five
seats.</P>
      <P>Altogether, the pro-reform parties have gained 249 seats in the
National Assembly.</P>
      <P>The KMT will mobilize its senior officials June 7 to "supervise"
the voting process of its party members to ensure that they vote
along with party lines, Tseng said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO HOLD PRIMARIES IN TAIPEI, ILAN, CHANGHUA COUNTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
hold party primaries in three counties, including the bitterly
contested Taipei County, Sunday to choose its candidates for the
year-end city and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT's Organization and Development Committee said the party
hopes to retain its present seats in the cities and counties, and
aims to regain seats in Taipei, Nantou and Changhua counties.</P>
      <P>As for southern Taiwan, which is a stronghold of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, the KMT is targeting Chiayi City and
Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said that the three-stage candidate
nomination operations are expected to be completed by June 22 at the
earliest.</P>
      <P>Under the party's nomination procedures, the party will first
coordinate a party candidate, and if coordination fails to produce a
candidate, then a primary will be held, which will include a vote by
party members coupled with public opinion polls, with the former
accounting for 30 percent and the latter accounting for 70 percent in
an overall assessment.</P>
      <P>In Taipei County, Legislator Chou Hsi-wei, who quit the People
First Party to join the KMT in April to boost his chances of winning,
Sanchung Mayor Lee Chien-lung, former Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao
and Taiwan Provincial Education Association Secretary-General Wang
Ling-hwei are vying for the party's candidacy.</P>
      <P>As Taipei County is considered a key battleground for the ruling
and the opposition parties, and victory in the county will be crucial
for the presidential election in 2008, the result of Sunday's primary
is raising a high degree of concern.</P>
      <P>In Ilan County, Ilan Mayor Lu Kuo-hua and Ilan County Speaker
Chang Chien-jung are rivals, while in Changhua County, Deputy Speaker
Hsiao Chin-tien and Legislator Cho Po-yuan are vying for the
candidacy. After the party member vote, the KMT will also unveil the
results of the public opinion polls.</P>
      <P>Under the second-stage nomination procedures, Tainan City and
Yunlin counties have no vote by members, but only public opinion
polls.</P>
      <P>Chen Jung-sheng, director of the KMT's Tainan chapter, emerged as
the party candidate in Tainan City, while in Yunlin, four hopefuls --
Legislator Hsu Shu-po, County Council Speaker Chen Chin-hsiu, former
deputy County Magistrate Chang Ching-liang, and Bureau of Public
Works Director Chang Tsung-ming -- are competing for the candidacy.</P>
      <P>Chang Ching-liang announced his decision to quit the party primary
earlier in the day. He said however that he will definately run in
the year-end election.</P>
      <P>Incumbent Hsinchu County Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin and Hualien
County Magistrate Hsieh Sheng-shan are poised to be nominated by the
KMT again.</P>
      <P>Once its candidates are decided by the end of the month, the KMT
will begin a consultation process with its allies -- the People First
Party and the New Party.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng said the year-end elections
are crucial to the political landscape, but with a "fair mechanism"
and "cooperation among the allies," the party is confident of winning
the support of the majority of people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An agricultural fair aimed at demonstrating
Taiwan's premium agricultural products and the government's results
in the promotion of agricultural upgrading, kicked off Saturday at
the plaza in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, the chief of staff to President Chen Shui-bian, and
Council of Agriculture Minister Lee Chin-lung, jointly opened the
fair and encouraged the public to visit the two-day open-air activity
to give their support to Taiwan's agricultural development.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening, Yu, who was born in a rural village, said
he has special feelings for agriculture and that he believes the
sector is one of Taiwan's most valuable assets.</P>
      <P>Since Chen assumed office five years ago, efforts have been made
to push for agricultural upgrading and transformation. The government
has been promoting agricultural research and development, assisting
farmers and traders to create brand names to boost sales, and
reducing the impact of Taiwan's market opening after joining the
World Trade Organization, said Yu.</P>
      <P>At the same time, it has also combined agricultural, cultural and
artistic resources in an effort to lift the country's agriculture
from the basic level of food supply to include tourism and leisure,
he noted, adding his belief that some day, Taiwan's agriculture will
enjoy stronger competitiveness than that of that industrial sector in
global markets.</P>
      <P>The fair has 275 booths divided into 11 districts, featuring
themes including biotech, agricultural security, premium farm
environment, disease control and quarantine, fishery,
leisure-oriented agriculture, the tea industry and rice.</P>
      <P>The activity is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.</P>

about the food they buy has become a key topic, Yu said. He noted
that because of this, major economies such as the European Union, the
United States, Canada and Japan have already made efforts to promote
the so-called production resume system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOW IS NOT OPPORTUNE TIME FOR CROSS-STRAIT SUMMIT: U.S. ACADEMICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 4 (CNA)
(By Lee Chia-fei and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Now is not an opportune time for the top
leaders on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to engage in dialogue,
two noted U.S. think tank scholars said Friday.</P>
      <P>Gary Schmitt, executive director of the Project for the New
American Century, and Dan Blumenthal, a research fellow at the
American Enterprise Institute, made the remarks while meeting with a
group of Taiwan journalists.</P>
      <P>Their comments came a day after President Chen Shui-bian said he
would be willing to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao in a third
country with no prerequisites and added that the United States could
be a possible bridge or platform for such a cross-strait summit.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Schmitt said, the U.S.
administration will not get involved in concrete
cross-strait affairs and instead looks forward to seeing direct
engagements between the Taiwan and China governments.</P>
      <P>Even though dialogue can help ease tension, Schmitt said Taiwan
should be very cautious and prudent in dealing with China. From a
long-term perspective, he said, Taiwan should wait until after China
has engaged in political reform. Before that, he predicted,
cross-strait dialogue will not achieve any major breakthroughs.</P>
      <P>Blumenthal echoed Schmitt's view, saying that cross-strait talks,
even high-level ones, can hardly achieve substantive results because
of the different political systems on either side.</P>
      <P>He further said it would be "tough and dangerous" if the United
States were to get involved in a proposed cross-strait summit
meeting. The pitfall could lie in the possibility that the United
States would pressure Taiwan to compromise in the course of
cross-strait dialogue in exchange for China's cooperation in other
fields, Blumenthal said, adding that if such a scenario does happen,
Taiwan could suffer setbacks.</P>
      <P>No matter whether a cross-strait summit could become a reality,
Blumenthal said, the United States must face up squarely to China's
ever-growing military build-up. In addition to pushing China to
dismantle its missiles targeting Taiwan, he said, the United States
should also demand that China consider Chen's proposal that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait forge a military mutual trust mechanism.</P>
      <P>Given the imbalance in the two sides' military strength,
Blumenthal said the right time has yet to come for Taiwan to hold a
summit meeting with China.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan press group, headed by Mainland Affairs Vice Chairman
Huang Wei-feng, is on a U.S. visit aimed at exploring major
U.S. think tanks' views on the development of cross-strait relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Exiled Chinese pro-democracy activist Wang
Dan said Saturday in Taipei that the conditions are not right for a
meeting between leaders from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is visiting Taiwan from his home-in-exile in the United
States, made the comment in a seminar held in Taipei about the
democratic situation and development in Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to remarks by President Chen Shui-bian Friday
that he would like to have talks with China's President Hu Jintao in
a "third country" without any preconditions, with the United States
as possibly be the best bridge for such a meeting. Chen made the
remarks at a meeting with New York Times Chairman Arthur Sulzberger,
who is in Taiwan on a three-day visit.</P>
      <P>The Chinese dissident said he is glad to see the goodwill shown
by each side of the Taiwan Strait and that he can see Taiwan's
eagerness to break the political impasse between the two sides.</P>
      <P>However, he reminded Chen that the results of the proposed talks
between Chen and Hu may result in uncertainty without any guarantee
if China does not first implement full democracy.</P>
      <P>Wang stressed that there is no mutual trust between the two sides
of the strait and that with the huge differences in their political
systems, he doubts whether the talks will lead to any concrete
breakthrough in cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>"Even if they really talk, it will be just for show," Wang
predicted.</P>
      <P>Due to the lack of press freedom in China, the Chinese people do
not have a full understanding of Taiwan, Wang said, stressing that
China's democratization will absolutely be the crucial boost to
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Kuomintang
said on another occasion that if the Chen administration still
refuses to recognize the so-called "1992 consensus" between the two
sides of the strait, he sees little chance of a Chen-Hu meeting.</P>

      <P>Yuan said Washington has maintained close contact with the KMT
and PFP since last December's legislative elections and such contact
became even closer during last month's China visits by KMT Chairman
Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>According to Yuan, Washington approached his office for Lien's
itinerary before Lien's departure for China, and after his return to
Taiwan, Washington further requested details of Lien's meeting with
Chinese President Hu Jintao to serve as background material for U.S.
President George W. Bush's May 5 phone talks with Hu.</P>
      <P>Yuan said he briefed Washington officials on everything he knew,
which includes that Lien and Hu discussed the issue of removing
China's missiles targeting Taiwan but did not touch upon Taiwan's
arms procurements from the United States.</P>
      <P>On a joint letter addressed by 33 members of U.S. House of
Representatives to Lien urging him to help expedite the passage of
the budget for a NT$480 billion arms procurement package, Yuan said
the letter has not been delivered to him yet.</P>
      <P>Yuan said the move was not activated by the administrative branch
and that he doubts if the letter represents the majority opinion of
the U.S. Congress, which has a total of 535 members.</P>
      <P>However, during a meeting with the visiting Taiwanese
journalists, Gary Schmitt, executive director of the Project for the
New American Century (PNAC) , a Washington-based think tank, said
Washington is concerned about the delay of the arms procurement
package by the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan and that the
joint letter by the 33 congressmen represents only this concern.</P>
      <P>American Enterprise Institute (AEI) resident fellow Dan
Blumenthal noted that the KMT used to support arms procurements from
the United States when it was in power and he said it is ironic that
the KMT has changed its attitude just because it is now in the
opposition.</P>
      <P>Blumenthal said it is only the KMT's hostility toward President
Chen Shui-bian that has prompted the party to block the arms
procurement package, which he said is not something a responsible
opposition party would do.</P>
      <P>Although the procurement will not immediately reverse the
military imbalance across the Taiwan Strait, it will help deter a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on Chen's claim that Soong met secretly with Chen
Yunlin, director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, in the United
States, Yuan described it as absolutely untrue.</P>
      <P>Yuan said it was impossible for them to meet each other because
Chen Yunlin left Washington, D.C. in early January, while Soong
arrived there Jan. 15.</P>
      <P>Chen has claimed that during his meeting with Chen Yunlin, Soong
promised to oppose a proposed constitutional amendment that would
allow for popular referendums on future constitutional amendments in
exchange for Beijing's approval for him to visit China.</P>
      <P>Soong filed a defamation suit Friday against Chen over the
allegation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HK FAILS TO PLAY INTERMEDIARY ROLE IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  4 (CNA)
(By C.F. Lee and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong has failed to play an
intermediary role between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, a
scholar of a U.S. think tank said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ellen Bork, deputy director of the Project for the New American
Century, made the remarks when she met with Mainland Affairs Council
Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng, who is leading a group of journalists
on a visit to the U.S.</P>
      <P>Huang also called on two other think tanks -- the American
Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Cato Institute -- to exchange
views with its researchers on such issues as Taiwan's proposed arms
procurement from the United States, U.S. policy toward Taiwan and how
to view the rising economic clout of China.</P>
      <P>Bork noted that when Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997,
China proposed a flexible approach of rule under the "one country,
two systems," which the U.S. seemed to think might serve as an option
for future cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Due to China's lack of freedom and democracy, however, the
democratic prospects of the former British colony under the formula
have grown dimmer in recent years, she said.</P>
      <P>The international community's aspiration that Hong Kong could
play an intermediary role between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
has fallen through and the experiment of "one country, two systems"
in Hong Kong has proved it is not a feasible model.</P>
      <P>After seeing what has happened in Hong Kong, the U.S. would
change its views that the model could be applied to Taiwan, Borg
predicted.</P>
      <P>Dan Blumenthal, an AEI research fellow, said that the U.S. has
grown impatient with China on such issues as North Korea and military
modernization, and will probably adopt a harsher approach.</P>
      <P>The U.S. hopes Taiwan will not take provocative action against
China, but it also hopes that the nation will not give up its
principles and bow to China's pressure, Blumenthal said.</P>
      <P>Christopher Preble, director of Foreign Policy Studies of the
Cato Institute, said the U.S. and China do not necessarily have to 
confront each other with the emergence of China's economic clout,
adding that its impact on U.S. security interests is limited.</P>
      <P>The focus should be on how to inject more economic freedom into
China's system to prompt change and allow exchanges between the
two countries moving toward stability.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Saturday
that the building of Taiwan into a "green silicon island" has the
country's sustainable development as its basis.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that "green" should take precedence over "silicon
island" and that "if there is a conflict between the two, then I
would rather choose green, as there is only one earth and only one
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received delegates to the
2005 International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE) , which
kicked off a three-day meeting in Taipei earlier in the day,
attracting more than 500 government officials and experts from 32
countries.</P>
      <P>Chen also exchanged views with the delegates on such issues as
energy policies, economic development and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>The president said that amid rising global demands for energy,
Taiwan will convene a national energy conference at the end of this
month.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Kyoto Protocol went into effect in February to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions and said that although Taiwan is
not a signatory of the protocol, it will nevertheless address the
issue seriously as a member of the global village.</P>
      <P>He said the upcoming energy conference will be attended by
business and environmental groups as well as think tanks and related
government officials, who will discuss related strategies to deal
with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
      <P>The president also expressed the hope that a more visionary
energy policy can be formulated to underscore Taiwan's determination
to work in line with the trends of international energy development.</P>

      <P>The government has not sent any group to

      <P>The officials were responding to Chinese media reports that a

      <P>The Chinese government said after opposition Kuomintang Chairman

      <P>However, President Chen Shui-bian noted that pandas are protected

prudently.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said the government will be glad to see the pandas
come to Taiwan if the procedures are in accordance with related

    <TEXT>
      <P>Respected Buddhist Master Yin Shun died at
the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation's Jing Si Abode in
the eastern county of Hualien Saturday at the age of 100.</P>
      <P>Yin Shun, known as the pioneer of humanistic Buddhism, celebrated
his 100th birthday in April. He was found dead early this morning.</P>
      <P>His widely known disciple Master Cheng Yen said Yin Shun had
inspired her to dedicate herself to glorifying Buddhism by serving
the people.</P>
      <P>Cheng Yen, founder of the Tzu Chi foundation which is Taiwan's
largest charity organization, said it was a great blessing for her to
be able to meet Yin Shun in her pursuit of Buddhist enlightenment.</P>
      <P>With Yin Shun's inspiration, Cheng Yen said, the Tzu Chi
foundation has managed to accomplish many projects in four major
fields -- charity, medical service and health care, education and
cultural development -- over the past four decades. She said she is
more than grateful for her mentor's teaching.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi foundation will organize a memorial service for Yin
Shun later this month, a spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Yin shun was born in Haining, Zhejiang province in China in 1906.
He was determined to pursue Buddhahood in his adolescence after
reading a Buddhist book. He became a monk at the age of 25.</P>
      <P>After the Chinese Communists took control of the mainland, Yin
Shun came to Taiwan to continue promoting humanistic Buddhism. He was
one of the most prolific Buddhist monks of the modern world. He had
written many books introducing Buddhist scriptures and teachings.

will not have any contacts with Chinese officials in private during
his upcoming visit to Beijing to attend an international conference.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has approved
Hu's application to visit China for the United Cities and Local
Governments (UCLG) World Council meetings.</P>
      <P>Hu said he is scheduled to leave for Beijing Tuesday as the UCLG
meetings will kick off June 8.</P>
      <P>"The main purpose of my attendance at the UCLG activities is to
introduce Taichung's major industries, cultural development and
tourist attractions, " said Hu, who once served as the Republic of
China's minister of foreign affairs and representative to the United
States.</P>
      <P>Hu ruled out the possibility of contacting Chinese officials in
private during his stay in Beijing. As a city mayor, Hu said he will
not touch on any political issues or topics related to the relations
across the Taiwan Strait during his visit.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung said earlier in the day that the
MAC has no reason to ban Hu's participation in an international event
like the UCLG meetings. You said Hu is not the first local
government chief to have obtained the government's permission to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct inbound investment in Taiwan amounted
to US$736 million in the first four months of this year, marking a
37.97 percent decline from the year-earlier level, according to
statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ou Chia-jui, director of the MOEA's Industrial Development and
Investment Center, attributed the drop to a combination of factors,
including changes in investment types and a global economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive analysis of investment activities showed that
during the four-month period, many foreign and overseas Taiwan
companies adopted indirect investment methods, such as issuing ADR or
GDR, to enter the local market, Ou said, adding that indirect
investment figures were usually not included from the MOEA's direct
inbound investment statistics.</P>
      <P>Amid the current worldwide economic downturn, Ou said, corporate
owners have become more cautious and conservative toward business
expansion, leading to a decline in the inbound investment. Likewise,
he said, Taiwan's outbound investment, including China-bound
investment, also dropped in the January-April period.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Saturday it supports
President Chen Shui-bian's proposal that the top leaders from the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait hold a summit meeting in a third place.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip William Lai was responding to Chen's remarks
a day earlier that he would be willing to meet with Chinese President
Hu Jintao in a third country with no prerequisites and added that the
United States could be a possible bridge or platform for such a
cross-strait summit.</P>
      <P>As cross-strait issues are closely related to Asia-Pacific
regional security and peace, Lai said, they have been major
international concerns. Therefore, he said, a cross-strait summit had
better take place at a destination other than Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lai said such an option can help avoid the thorny
cross-strait dispute over Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>Responding to the main opposition Kuomintang's claim that a
Chen-Hu summit meeting in the United States is just a pipe dream, Lai
said the president's statement was mainly aimed at telling the world
Taiwan's basic stance toward negotiations with China.</P>
      <P>"President Chen was reiterating our stance on cross-strait talks.
He was telling the world that Taiwan is willing to talk with China so
long as the dialogue is conducted on an equal footing and with no
premises and no preconditions. Chen's remarks can help prevent the
international community from misunderstanding that Taiwan rejects
China's offer for talks," Lai said.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three things which a
wise and good man holds in awe. He holds in awe the Laws of God,
persons in authority, and the words of wisdom of holy men. A fool, on
the other hand, does not know that there are Laws of God; he,
therefore, has no reverence for them; he is disrespectful to persons
in authority, and condemns the words of wisdom of holy men."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Report Presses Easy Ways
to Fix Airline Security.

Significant gaps in security at the United States airports could
be curtailed even at a time of rising passenger traffic by quickly
making a wide range of relatively modest changes in screening people
and bags, a confidential report by the Department of Homeland
Security has concluded. The proposed fine-tuning of airport security
includes expanding the use of devices that can detect trace amounts
of explosives and stationing more armed guards in secure areas.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chanting "No pollution! We want to survive!"
a group of college and university students led a march in downtown
Taipei hoping to enhance the public's attention to environmental
issues Sunday on World Environment Day.</P>
      <P>The students from National Taiwan University, Tung Hai University
and other universities or colleges gathered at Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall, some of them naked from the waist up, to show their
determination to protect Taiwan's environment.</P>
      <P>Wu Hung-chun of Transworld Institute of Technology, wearing a
banner reading "We want to survive! " on his bare chest, said more
than 200 students were marching to arouse society's awareness of the
importance of the government's environmental policy.</P>
      <P>Wu and schoolmate Chang Chia-sheng, also shirtless, called on the
people not to focus on their bodies. Instead, people should pay
attention to environmental issues that have long been ignored, they
said.</P>
      <P>As the students marched toward the Presidential Office, members
of the public joined them. They hoped the activity would draw 1,000
participants.</P>
      <P>They appealed for "environmentally friendly policies, " "clean
water sources, " "safe food and water, " "recyclable energy, "
"primitive mountains and forests, " and "values fashioned through
self-awareness."</P>
      <P>World Environment Day is one of the principle vehicles through
which the United Nations stimulates awareness of the environment and
enhances political attention and action.</P>
      <P>This year's World Environment Day theme is "Green Cities" with
the slogan "Plan for the Planet." The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) said World Environment Day is an event for the people,
with colorful activities such as street rallies, bicycle parades,
green concerts, essay and poster competitions in schools, tree
planting, as well as recycling and clean-up campaigns.</P>
      <P>The main international celebrations of World Environment Day 2005
will be held in San Francisco.</P>

      <P>China's bullying of Taiwan in a present
security meeting serves as a clear indication that the Chinese
communist regime has never altered its hegemonic designs against
Taiwan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lu was referring to the Fourth Asian Security Conference being

      <P>He called it a hard evidence that the names of the participants
from Taiwan, some academics, are listed at the end of the meeting's

every means to suppress it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO PUSH FOR CLEAN ENERGY: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will push for the development
and application of clean, recycled energy to alleviate Taiwan's
reliance on fossil fuels, 98 percent of which is imported from
abroad, Bureau of Energy Chairman Yeh Hui-ching said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan plans to allocate NT$3 billion (US$96.77
million) each year beginning fiscal year 2006 to finance the
research, development and application of clean, recycled energy,
which includes solar power, biomass energy, wind power and marine
energy, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks during a speech on energy policy at the
opening of the Academic Workshop on Energy Economics Across the
Taiwan Strait sponsored by the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research.</P>
      <P>Yeh said reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels is the only
way to lessen the risks regarding import sources and price
fluctuations.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that as Taiwan's self-produced energy resources are
scarce, the country's imports of fuels have increased noticeably over
the past 20 years as the domestic economy has expanded, from 88.8
percent in 1984 to 97.9 percent in 2004.</P>
      <P>In the same period, per capita electricity consumption also
surged, from 2,595 kwh in 1984 to 9,131 kwh in 2004, marking an
increase of 3.52 fold, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why Taiwan's energy consumption has increased
over the past 20 years is probably because energy prices have been
relatively lower than most of the other major economies in Asia, Yeh
said, adding that the lack of economic incentives to encourage
energy saving was another reason.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that currently the country still lacks mandatory
measures to reduce energy consumption while manufacturing industries
requiring high amounts of energy remain the backbone of Taiwan's
industrial sector, Yeh said the government and the private sector
must work in concert to increase energy resources and promote
conservation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOSPEL'S 140-YEAR HISTORY IN TAIWAN PROOF OF GOD'S LOVE: REVEREND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Christian priests introduced Western culture
to Taiwan 140 years ago, contributing to Taiwan's modernization and
proving that God loves Taiwan, a leading Presbyterian reverend said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Rev. Lo Jung-kuang, secretary-general of Taiwan's Presbyterian
Church, said in the face of moral deterioration and the dissolution
of values, Christians should work harder to spread the Gospel as a
means of averting Taiwan's moral crisis.</P>
      <P>Lo was speaking at a service worshiping God for His grace to
Taiwan over the past 140 years. The service was held simultaneously
in six cities, including Taipei, Changhua, Kaohsiung and Hualien.</P>
      <P>Taipei's service was held at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
with more than 10,000 people participating, including former
president Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Lo said since Beijing took over Taipei's seat at the United
Nations in 1971, Taiwan has become an international orphan. It was
from that time on that the Presbyterian Church devoted itself to
promoting Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>He called on church-goers to cooperate with civilian groups and
the government to spread God's justice and build a relationship
between Taiwan and China based on justice and peace.</P>
      <P>In 1856, Scottish Dr. James L. Maxwell landed in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan, the first Western priest with medical skills to
preach in Taiwan. He formally started his preaching career in Taiwan
when he moved to Tainan on June 16.</P>
      <P>Six years later, Canadian Rev. George Leslie Mackay arrived in
Taiwan to open another chapter in Taiwan's Christian history. Both
Maxwell and Mackay were Presbyterian priests.</P>
      <P>There are now 1,218 Presbyterian churches across Taiwan, with
230,000 believers worshiping God in 16 languages.</P>

      <P>Foreigners leaning Mandarin will have a new
tool at their disposal soon when a new Web site opens with special
tonal-recognition software to aid in pronunciation, according to the
Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>According to a news release issued by the ministry's Department
of Industrial Technology, the Web site will be set up by L Labs, Inc.</P>
      <P>The automatic speech analysis system developed by L Labs can
recognize and analyze the voices of those learning Chinese and report
on whether or not their pronunciation is correct.</P>
      <P>Building the Web site will cost between NT$8 million and NT$10
million ( US$255,918 to US$319,898) is expected to create
after-market revenues of around NT$800 million (US$25.6 million) for
Taiwan's publishers of Chinese- language study books, the department
said.</P>
      <P>With globalization and the emergence of China as an economic
powerhouse, the department said Mandarin has become a popular second
language for foreign students, not to mention the 1.3 billion people
who use it as a native language. The Web site will help the country
earn a leading position in the Chinese-language learning industry.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 17-year-old prodigy from National Taiwan
University (NTU) who became an NTU freshman at the age of 13 is
scheduled to leave for the United States later this month to pursue a
doctorate, education sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chien-yi from Kaohsiung County, the youngest university
freshman in memory in Taiwan, decided to pursue a Ph.D. from the
Georgia Institute of Technology because he said that Georgia Tech has
the graduate program that he likes the most. He has also been
accepted by Stanford University, Texas University at Austin and
Purdue University.</P>
      <P>Lin graduated from NTU's Electrical Engineering Department at a
commencement ceremony held in Taipei Saturday after studying at the
"top choice" department for four years -- a long time for a whiz-kid
who only spent seven years finishing his elementary through high
school education, which usually takes at least 12 years.</P>
      <P>Lin's classmates at the NTU Electrical Engineering Department did
not consider him "childish" at all. On the contrary, all of his NTU
friends said that Lin is more sophisticated than most of his
university peers, at least mentally, despite his age.</P>
      <P>Besides, according to his friends, Lin is an independent man who
has seldom relied on his parents, both of them teachers at junior
high schools in Kaohsiung, for their opinions or important decisions.</P>
      <P>Lin, however, is just like every 17-year-old in Taiwan and is
obsessed with video games in addition to his two other hobbies:
playing the game "go" and sleeping.</P>
      <P>Lin, one year shy of completing his three-year course at Tainan
First Senior High School, was allowed to take the Joint University
Entrance Examination, receiving a remarkable score of 451.7 and
earning himself entrance to NTU's Electrical Engineering Department
in July 2001, becoming the youngest university freshman in Taiwan in
the island's 48-year history of the highly competitive joint
university entrance examinations.</P>
      <P>At that time, he said that the secret to his success in his
studies was "preparing before class, concentrating during class and
reviewing after class."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China should destroy its missiles aimed at
Taiwan and open peace talks with the island as the first step toward
a peaceful solution to cross-Taiwan Strait disputes, Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) lawmaker Lo Chih-ming said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lo, a caucus whip of the pro-independence TSU at the Legislative
Yuan, made the remarks when answering questions from reporters after
U. S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said a day earlier in the
Fourth Asian Security Conference held in Singapore that China's
military expansion will not only hurt the interests of Taiwan and the
United States, but it will also affect China's other trading partners
in Asia.</P>
      <P>In recent years, China has been building its military at a
two-digit annual growth rate, Lo warned, adding that China is rising
as a military power.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's fast military buildup, Taiwan should ask
the country to renounce its military threats against Taiwan by fully
destroying its hundreds of missiles targeting the island, in an event
to be observed by the United Nations or the United States to protect
security and prosperity in the strait and the rest of the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The arms destruction precedence set up by the United States and
the former Soviet Union can serve as a good example for Taiwan and
China, he proposed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former President Lee Teng-hui, who is the spiritual
leader of the TSU, advocated a new constitution for Taiwan,
describing it as an urgent need for Taiwan in its efforts to become a
truly independent, free and democratic nation.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China, Taiwan's current formal designation, is a
laggard name for the country and the international community, Lee
said, claiming that the country must be renamed to effectively reach
out to the world.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is the promised land from God for the people in Taiwan,
and we should treasure this land and make it a nation ruled by
justice and peace and full of joy," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee issued the call during an activity held by the Presbyterian
Church at the plaza of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in downtown

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Assembly will gather to act on
a package of constitutional amendments on Monday, with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the leading opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , which control 244 out of the 300 seats between
them, vowing to ensure that their representatives vote in favor of
the amendments.</P>
      <P>Beginning from 2 p.m. Monday, the National Assembly deputies will
gather to receive a briefing from the presidium about the rules of
order, following by a discussion in which representatives of various
parties will give presentations of their parties' view on the
amendments.</P>
      <P>Chen Ta-chun, who is leader of the DPP National Assembly members,
said these discussions are not provided for by law but it wouldn't go
amiss to give the opponents of the amendments, mainly minor parties,
an opportunity to air their grievances.</P>
      <P>During the discussions, Chen said six deputies of his party will
make a strong case for the amendments which will half the number of
lawmakers in the Legislative Yuan, change the electoral system
through which lawmakers are chosen, allow for a popular referendum on
constitutional amendments, and do away with the National Assembly,
which is tasked only with voting of the constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>Claiming that all these amendments were developed from the DPP's
ideas over the past decades, Chen said the discussions will allow the
opponents to vent their anger about the proposals and thereby prevent
them from filibustering the vote the following day, which will be the
highlight of the session.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that all 127 DPP deputies are present to vote
for the amendments, Chen said that party authorities have booked a
hotel near the venue to accommodate all of them on Monday and DPP
Chairman Su Tseng-chang will show up at the venue of the National
Assembly Tuesday morning to see that party deputies have abided by
the party's policy in casting their votes.</P>
      <P>Any DPP deputies who fail to show up at the venue by 8: 50 a.m.
Tuesday will be fired and replaced by alternate party candidates,
Chen warned.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which has 117 seats, will have its secretary-general,
Lin Fong-cheng, see that every party deputies follows the party's
line in voting Tuesday, said a KMT official.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , which is the biggest party
opposing the amendments, commanding 21 seats, said they won't
filibuster to stop the vote since it would be useless to do so.</P>
      <P>Chien Lin Whei-jun, the convener of the TSU deputies, said her
party representatives will vote against the amendments and let the

    <HEADLINE>PFP POISED TO VIE FOR CITY MAYORS, COUNTY HEADS IN PROMISING AREAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) will field
candidates for December's city mayors and county magistrates
elections in various constituencies where the party stands a good
chance of winning, PFP lawmaker Lin Yu-fang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the comments during an exclusive interview with the
Central News Agency after he met PFP Chairman James Soong a day
earlier for more than an hour to exchange opinions on various key
political issues, including the party's future line.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that it is an undeniable fact that there is a
big overlapping between the PFP and the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) in their public support base, Lin stressed that his party is
set to put forth its own hopefuls in ares such as Keelung City and
Nantou County. "The PFP will no longer bow to pressure from our ally,
the KMT, this time," he claimed.</P>
      <P>He also made it clear that the PFP will stand pat on its resolve
to "walk its own way" to achieve its two major goals -- political
reconciliation and ethnic harmony amid wide speculation over its
future course -- continuing cooperating with the main opposition KMT
or aligning with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) based
on the Feb. 24 meeting between Soong and President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The KMT, the PFP and the New Party form the pro-unification "pan
blue" alliance in a polarized political wrangle against the
pro-independence "pan-green" camp of the DPP and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Liao Feng-teh, director of the KMT's
Organization Development Committee, said that the year-end elections
for city mayors and county magistrates will be a race dominated by a
competition between the "pan-blue" and the "pan-green" camps.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP must collaborate and field candidates jointly
to win over the "pan-green" competitors. Liao said, adding that such
a KMT-PFP cooperation must be across the board and not limited to
just several constituencies.</P>
      <P>However, Liao was skeptical of the PFP's stance and urged the PFP
to clarify its party line to help lead to cooperation between the two
parties.</P>
      <P>Political observers said that the PFP will face a thorny issue as
to the question of whether it should side with the KMT or the DPP,
and predicted that the PFP will have to show its hole card as the
elections approach or risk becoming an outcast.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been doing fine in terms of
reducing social and economic pressures, but this is not the case when
it comes to dealing with pollution and managing its ecological
resources, according to a government report released Sunday on World
Environment Day.</P>
      <P>"The 2004 Sustainable Development Indicators of Taiwan, " issued
by the Cabinet's National Sustainable Development Commission, tracked
the nation's performance in six areas and found that it can take
pride in only two -- institutional response and urban development.</P>
      <P>The indicators show the country has done poorly in preventing or
tackling pollution, as well as in the management of ecological
resources. To improve the situation, the government has enacted a
land rehabilitation law, the report noted.</P>
      <P>It urged the nation to pay special attention to several issues
that have been "worsening fast, " including carbon dioxide emission,
arable land, cancer death rate, passenger car ownership in urban
areas, and the share of high energy-consuming industry output in the
total production of manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chun-jung, chief executive officer of the commission, said
Taiwan is one of the few countries releasing such reports in response
to a United Nations request. Even the United States has not released
its sustainable development indicators.</P>
      <P>The indicators are good for "comparing with ourselves, " he said,
adding that the report serves as a data bank for reviewing government
policies and shows "where we should be going," he said.</P>
      <P>This was the second yearly report, which also aims to invite
public interest and participation, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 1,000 environmentalists, including
30-odd foreigners, marched in downtown Taipei Sunday as part of an
World Environment Day campaign calling for an immediate stop to the
endless economic growth and development policy.</P>
      <P>The activity culminated when all the marchers lied down on the
boulevard in front of the Presidential Office, chanting "We want to
survive! " and demanding the government to take environmental
protection seriously and to stop all inappropriate development
projects.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-hua, president of Taiwan Environmental Protection
Federation and one of the organizers, said the participants were
"environmental refugees" from across the country who did not oppose
economic development per se but wanted the government to realize that
too many ill-advised development projects and destructions of land
resources are making it increasingly difficult for people to survive.</P>
      <P>A Canadian artist, dressed in traditional Chinese dresses and
wearing wooden slippers, said Taiwan's environmental degradation is
much more serious than many other countries, and yet the people do
not seem to care very much.</P>
      <P>A Scottish woman who was working as a volunteer in Taiwan warned
that Taiwan was getting close to ecological collapse and running out
of natural resources. She called on the people to stop wasting and
unnecessary shopping.</P>
      <P>The marchers appealed for "environmentally friendly policies, "
"clean water sources, " "safe food and water, " "recyclable energy, "
"primitive mountains and forests, " and "values fashioned through

Those who are born by nature dull and yet will not take the trouble
to acquire understanding are the lowest class of people."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SENATOR CALLS FOR INCREASED CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  June  5  (CNA)
(By Chiang Chun and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) said Sunday that only by maintaining the status quo in the
Taiwan Strait and increasing cross-strait bilateral exchanges can
Taiwan and China solve their differences peacefully.</P>
      <P>Addressing the annual meeting of the Asia Society in a keynote
speech entitled "A Rising China," Feinstein said that China's rapidly
expanding military strength and the Democratic Progressive Party's
taking power in Taiwan have impacted cross-Taiwan Strait stability.</P>
      <P>Feinstein said that China has accelerated its arms build-up in
recent years, with its reported military spending rising by 16
percent over the past two years. She added that the actual figure
could be three times higher. She also pointed to the some 700 Chinese
missiles targeting Taiwan. Feinstein said that all this is upsetting
the delicate balance that has been in place in the Taiwan Strait for
decades.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, meanwhile, landmark visits to China by opposition
leaders Lien Chan and James Soong have left President Chen Shui-bian
little option to avoid the "China issue," Feinstein said.</P>
      <P>Noting that time is on China's side, Feinstein claimed that China
will soon gain the upper hand in military and economic influence
across the Taiwan Strait. In light of this, she added, Washington
should continue its "status quo" policy in the Taiwan Strait while at
the same time intensifying communications with both China and Taiwan
to prevent any undesirable situation from occurring.</P>
      <P>Feinstein said that China is expected to have huge influence in
Asia in the future, and the United States has monitored related
developments closely.</P>
      <P>She called for Washington to pay equally close attention to Asia
as it does to Europe, saying that the United States should establish
a U.S.-China crisis management mechanism to enable the United States
to effectively handle any crises that might arise.</P>
      <P>Feinstein said that the United States should increase high-level
military visits with China to reduce misunderstanding and as a way to
help solve cross-strait issues peacefully.</P>
      <P>She also said she foresees increasingly closer exchanges between
China and Taiwan in the commercial and cultural sectors in the years
to come and that China's booming economy will help push for
democratization within the country.</P>

      <P>An official of the government-funded Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy (TFD) denied over the weekend a report that
the foundation has financed a journal launched by Chinese democracy
activists overseas in exchange for their support for Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>According to the report published by a Beijing-based newspaper on
Friday, the Beijing Spring monthly receives a US$50,000 subsidy fund
per year from the Taiwan foundation under a contract established
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The report claimed that under this arrangement, members of the
journal's editorial committee are assigned by Taiwan's National
Security Bureau, and any personnel adjustments require the bureau's
approval.</P>
      <P>Chou Yi-cheng, an official with the TFD, dismissed the report as
unfactual.</P>
      <P>Chou said that the foundation did subsidize Beijing Spring last

has also sought donations from other organizations including the
U.S-based National Endowment for Democracy.</P>

      <P>The caucus of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) in the mission-oriented National Assembly said
Monday that it will explain clearly why it is determined to vote
against the proposed package of amendments to the Constitution in the
upcoming NA general session later in the day.</P>
      <P>NA deputies are gathering Monday afternoon to act on the
Legislative Yuan-approved constitutional amendment package. They will
first receive a briefing from the presidium about the procedual
rules, and then start a discussion in which representatives of the
various parties and groups will give presentations of their views and
positions on the reform package.</P>
      <P>Chien-Lin Whei-jun, the convener of the TSU caucus in the
National Assembly; Chen Wen-kuei, secretary general of the caucus;
and Chen Yi-shen, the spokesman for the caucus, will represent the
party in speaking at the gathering.</P>
      <P>The TSU, the biggest party opposing the amendments, commands only
21 seats in the 300-seat ad hoc National Assembly whose only mission
is to vote on the constitutional amendment package.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposals include reducing the number of seats in
the Legislative Yuan from the current 225 to 113, extending the
tenure of legislators from the present three years to four years,
adopting a "single seat, two ballots" legislative electoral system,
phasing out the National Assembly, holding popular referendums on
future constitutional amendments, and empowering the Council of Grand
Justices to screen presidential and vice presidential impeachment
proposals.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the National Assembly is obligated to vote on
the package of the proposed amendments as a whole instead of item by
item, Chien said that while presenting the party's view in the
upcoming discussion, they will try to make clear how unreasonable
they feel this is.</P>
      <P>She and the other two TSU representatives will make clear the
party's consistent opposition to the constitutional reforms and
explain why the proposed "single seat, two ballots" legislative
electoral system will damage Taiwan's democracy.</P>

the amendments and let the people judge which party is right on these

developments.</P>
      <P>Products and technologies that were cited at the ceremony
included OLED, LCoS, wide-angle view and low color shift technology,
active matrix full color OLED display, and low temperature poly
silicon technology.</P>
      <P>Takeyasu Murayama, head consultant to the Japanese-invested Asahi
Glass Fine Techno Taiwan, which was cited as a role model in
cross-border joint-ventures, said that Taiwan's development of LCD
technology and production has been amazing.</P>
      <P>According to Murayama, Taiwan industry's consumption of LCD glass
panels exceeded that of South Korea last year to become the world's
largest in this field and similar usage is expected to grow further
this year.</P>
      <P>The following two or three years will be crucial to find out
whether Taiwan will remain the world's No. 1 LCD country with severe
competition from South Korea, Murayama added. According to tallies
compiled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan's output of
TFT-LCDs and related products totaled NT$715 billion (US$23.06
billion) last year and the figure is expected to exceed the NT$1.37
trillion mark in 2006.</P>
      <P>Ho estimated that Taiwan's production of TFT-LCDs and related
products will exceed NT$1 trillion this year with research and
development as well as manufacturing operations in these companies
continuing to flourish.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO PUSH FOR SECOND PHASE OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will push for a second phase of constitutional reforms after
the first stage of reforms is accomplished, DPP Chairman Su
Tseng-chang said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the next phase of constitutional reforms will be
aimed at creating a "timely, relevant and viable" constitution that
will enhance the country's efficiency as President Chen Shui-bian has
promised.</P>
      <P>Su said the president will invite representatives of various
political parties and sectors to join a constitutional reform
committee to discuss reform issues such as government efficiency,
human rights and labor rights protection as well as the inclusion of
a special chapter on the well-being of aboriginal citizens in the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during a meeting of the DPP's National
Assembly caucus.</P>
      <P>The National Assembly is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a
constitutional amendment package adopted by the Legislative Yuan last
August.</P>
      <P>Major items in the package include reducing the number of
legislative seats from the present 225 to 113 and adopting a "single
seat, two votes" legislative electoral system starting with the
seventh legislature to be elected in 2007, as well as phasing out the
National Assembly to allow for popular referendums on future
constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>A three-quarters majority vote is required for the passage of any
amendments. The DPP and the opposition Kuomintang, which are in favor
of the package, together control 80 percent of the seats in the
National Assembly.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said the
second phase of constitutional reforms will not involve controversial
issues such as changes to the country's sovereignty, territorial
boundaries or official designation.</P>
      <P>The constitutional reform committee will seek a national
consensus on the reforms to smooth their passage, which requires the
endorsement of at least three-quarters of legislators and over 50
percent of eligible voters in a popular referendum, Lai said.</P>
      <P>While the existing Constitution, which was enacted decades ago in
China, provides insufficient human rights protection, improvements
are also required in the Constitution in terms of the country's
political system, which is neither a presidential system nor a
parliamentary system, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>However, opposition People First Party Legislator Chang
Hsien-yao, who also serves as director of the party's Policy Research
Center, said he does not see any possibility or necessity to carry
out a second stage of constitutional reforms in light of the
inter-party differences over the current proposed reforms.</P>
      <P>Chang said the current proposed constitutional reforms were
adopted by the Legislative Yuan without adequate discussion in
society, adding that it is very unreasonable that the National
Assembly, whose delegates were determined in an election that saw a
voter turnout rate of only 23 percent, has the power to amend the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>On the constitutional reform committee proposed by President
Chen, Chang said the president has no power to form such a committee
because he is not empowered to amend the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The tiny, serene Hakka rural township of
Hengshan in Hsinchu County seems to have Cupid's blessing as 67
couples living there have celebrated their diamond wedding
anniversary, photographer Chen Yu-shu said Monday.</P>
      <P>Compared with Hsinchu City, where there are only 20-odd couples
out of a population of 380,000 who have been married for over 60
years, the Hengshan rural township boasts of 67 such couples out of a

areas around Hsinchu as an artist-in-residence.</P>
      <P>The Hakka seniors are intriguing and they made superb models,
Chen said.</P>

their final report to press the White House for
information showing whether the government has
done enough to prevent another catastrophic

Wall Street Journal: Promotion Track Fades
for Those Starting at Bottom

Outsourcing and aggressive outside hiring
have made many enterprises more efficient and
profitable. But these trends raise the risk of
workers in low-wage jobs getting trapped there.
Annette Bernhardt, a sociologist at New York 
University Law School, studied the salaries of 
thousands of workers over nearly 40 years. She 
found that 12 percent of workers who started in
the labor market in the late 1960s and early
1970s remained stuck in low-wage jobs 10 to 15
years into their careers. But for workers who
entered the labor market in the 1980s and early
1990s, that percentage had more than doubled, to
28 percent. African-Americans have extra
difficulty making it out of poverty, according
to a 2003 study by American University economist

    <HEADLINE>PENTAGON WARNS AGAINST CHINA'S MILITARY BUILDUP: JAPANESE DAILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is increasingly growing
uneasy with China's military buildup, with the Pentagon positioning
it as one of the worst threats together with international terrorism
in an annual assessment, the Sankei Shimbun reported Monday.</P>
      <P>In a report datelined Washington, the Japanese daily newspaper
said that in its annual assessment of China's military capabilities
that will be published soon, the Pentagon lists China's fast military
expansion and international terrorist attacks as being on the same
level under "worst threats."</P>
      <P>According to the report, the Pentagon made the assessment based
on the following arguments: China increased the number of short-range
missiles aimed at Taiwan in the Nanjing military region, purchased
more advanced jet fighters from Russia, deployed a larger number of
fast-response troops to deal with contingencies in the Taiwan Strait,
and stepped up military drills to counter U. S. military planes and
ballistic missiles.</P>
      <P>China's military capabilities are expanding at a rate that
exceeds the tolerance of the U. S., the report said, adding that U.
S. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld told a group of U. S.
reporters June 1 that it is imperative to pay close attention to
China's military buildup.</P>
      <P>Rumsfeld said that the Pentagon's annual assessment of China's
capabilities shows that China is spending more than its leaders
acknowledge, expanding its missile capabilities and developing
advanced military technology, according to an Associated Press (AP)
report June 4.</P>
      <P>The AP story quoted Rumsfeld as saying that China now has the
world's third-largest military budget, behind the U. S. and Russia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PEACE, PARITY BEDROCK FOR CROSS-STRAIT ENGAGEMENTS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday that peace
and parity are Taiwan's top guidelines for promoting engagements
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks while meeting with Tadashi Ikeda, who as
head of the Taipei office of the Japanese Interchange Association
(JIA) is Japan's de facto ambassador to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Our basic attitude toward China has been that cross-strait
issues should be dealt with in accordance with the principles of
peace and parity, " Hsieh said, adding that Taiwan is more than
willing to promote peaceful cross-strait engagements under the
premise that Taiwan's present status quo is maintained and its
independent sovereign status remains intact.</P>
      <P>The premier further said the so-called "China fever" in Taiwan
fueled by media reports about two opposition leaders' controversial
visits to China was short-lived as proved by the results of the May
14 National Assembly election.</P>
      <P>In his view, Hsieh said, China's invitations to Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong
were part of its efforts to draw attention away from the backlash
that China's anti-secession law created in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This strategy has proved to be ineffective in swaying Taiwan
people's determination to safeguard their democratic way of life and
Taiwan's separate identity since the KMT and the PFP failed to do
well in the National Assembly election held after their leaders'
high-profile China visits, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said he hopes China's rise as a world power can be
peaceful and democratic. Otherwise, he said, its emergence could pose
a threat to the world.</P>
      <P>Noting that both Taiwan and Japan are liberal democracies, Hsieh
said he is hopeful that the two countries can strengthen cooperation
based on their shared values of peace, democracy and rule of law.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he is pleased to see Japan offer visa-free privileges
to prospective Taiwan visitors during the ongoing world exposition in
the central Japanese prefecture of Aichi, which will last through
September this year.</P>
      <P>"I'm hopeful that the visa-free privileges for Taiwan citizens
can become permanent, " said Hsieh, who has a master's degree in law
from Japan's Kyodo University.</P>
      <P>Japan has been the biggest source of foreign tourists to Taiwan.
Hsieh said Taiwan expects to attract one million Japanese visitors
this year.</P>
      <P>For his part, Ikeda, a retired career diplomat, said he will do
his utmost to promote bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various
fields during his tenure.</P>
      <P>Ikeda used to be Japanese ambassador to Holland and Brazil. He
also once served as chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs's Asian
Affairs Bureau and the ministry's secretary-general.</P>
      <P>JIA is a quasi-official body authorized to handle relations with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice on Monday paroled
former ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Chou
Po-lun, who was jailed in 2003 for corruption.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Justice Tang Chin-chuan said the ministry
believes Chou has repented his crime and that the likelihood is low
that he will commit the same crime again.</P>
      <P>Tang pointed out that Chou has served 46.1 percent of his jail
time and that over the past five years, most people convicted of
corruption in Taiwan have been granted parole after serving 43.1 to
48.7 percent of their terms.</P>
      <P>Chou was convicted of corruption by the Supreme Court on Jan. 29,
2003 for accepting bribes from the contractor of Taipei's Junghsing
Park development project during his term as a Taipei City councilor
in 1988.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker was sentenced to six years in prison and was
deprived of his civil rights for four years. His prison term was to
have run from Feb. 17, 2003 to Oct. 26, 2008 after deducting 82 days
during which he was kept in custody by the court, according to the
ministry.</P>
      <P>He was also sentenced to five months for obstruction of official
duties in the same case, but the term was converted into a fine and
paid.</P>
      <P>Chou first petitioned for parole in December 2004 but was turned
down by the ministry in January this year.</P>
      <P>According to Tang, although Chou had one violation last year
while incarcerated, he received two credits this year for his active
participation in community service and the arrangement of a Lunar New
Year party for prison inmates.</P>
      <P>Tang said it is still uncertain if Chou can be released before
the Dragon Boat Festival, which falls on June 11 this year, because
authorities still need some time to process the paperwork.</P>
      <P>District prosecutors in eastern Hualien County, where Chou is
imprisoned, need to report the case to the Hualien District Court for
parole supervision arrangements, Tang noted, adding that the
processing time usually takes 10 days to one month.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of leprosy patients petitioned the
Department of Health Monday not to evict them from the sanatorium
they call home even though officials say that they will be relocated
to a newer and medically more sophisticated facility.</P>
      <P>The lepers and a number of their supporters say that the
75-year-old Leseng Sanatorium in Hsinchuang, Taipei County is the
best place for the patients to live and that the health department
has forsaken them to make way for construction of part of the
Hsinchuang mass rapid transit system.</P>
      <P>Health officials say that other departments were instrumental in
deciding the fate of the Leseng Sanatorium, but added that the new
facility, located nearby, will be more modern and can provide the
more than 300 leper patients with up-to-date treatments and
facilities.</P>
      <P>However, the Leseng residents dispute this, claiming that it was
the health department that turned over the matter to the Taipei
Department of Rapid Transit Systems, which will demolish the
buildings next month.</P>
      <P>Activists of a youth organization for Leseng patients' rights
said that under the Executive Yuan's newly revised regulations
governing the implementation of the Cultural Heritage Preservation
Law, the Leseng Sanatorium should be an historic site which is
protected. They say that the authorities are reluctant to put the
regulations into effect because they want to clear the way for the
MRT project.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the lepers petitioned the health department
many times in May, asking the government to refurbish the old
facility to allow its occupants to stay where they feel is home. The
health department maintains that it is only trying to give the
patients the best possible treatment.</P>
      <P>Lending support to the lepers' cause, a Japanese activist said
that if the Taiwan government does not care about the Leseng lepers'
rights, he will try to bring the issue to the attention of the
international community by publishing articles and reporting the
situation to Japanese representatives who assist the United Nations
Human Rights Commission in its survey on lepers' human rights around

    <HEADLINE>CONVENE OR NOT, N.A. DELEGATES TO BE PAID FOR FULL SESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Delegates to the National Assembly will be
paid for as long as the session lasts, even on days that no meetings
are scheduled, Yeh Junn-rong, secretary-general of the National
Assembly, said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the session has been defined as starting on May 30
and will end when the assembly votes on the constitutional amendment
package on June 7.</P>
      <P>He said that according to the law governing the operations of the
National Assembly, delegates will be paid for each of the nine days
even if the assembly was in recess.
</P>
      <P>As of June 6, the delegates had only met twice. Delegates will
receive a transportation allowance and unconfirmed reports have said
that they will be paid NT$7,000 (US$220.8) in total for each day.</P>
      <P>Yeh stressed that the National Assembly has shortened its session
from the original plan of one month, and the public should focus more
on whether the delegates have carried out their duties in voting on
the constitutional amendment package and not just dwell on how much
the delegates are making from the assembly.</P>
      <P>However, the public will have nothing to speculate about
regarding the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) since its
National Assembly leaders passed a resolution Monday stating that DPP
participants in the assembly will not accept payment for simply doing
their duty</P>
      <P>Chen Ta-chun, DPP caucus whip, said that some media reports have
alleged that some delegates are trying to line their pockets by
taking part in the assembly and the DPP wants nothing to do with this
sort of thing; therefore, it will be requesting that an auditing team
publish the details of pay and stipends to assuage any public
misgivings.</P>
      <P>The National Assembly convened at 2 p.m. Monday and after a
report on the convening procedures, various political parties and
groups sent representatives to explain their stances on the
constitutional amendments, and the DPP, which has the most seats at
127 out of 300, decided not to deliver a report to save time,
although it will respect the wishes of minor political parties or
groups who want to elaborate on their stances.</P>
      <P>The mission of the convening delegates will be to vote on such
constitutional amendment proposals as reducing the 225 seats in the
legislature to 113, extending the tenure of legislators from the

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO CONTINUE CAMPAIGN AGAINST PIRACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday his
administration will continue its all-out campaign against commercial
piracy even though the country has registered the world's fastest
rates in lowering music and software piracy.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge while meeting with executives of a local
copyright owner association and organizers of a just-concluded pop
concert aimed at raising public awareness of the importance of
intellectual property rights (IPR) protection.</P>
      <P>Thanks to concerted efforts of relevant government agencies, Chen
said, Taiwan's commercial piracy rates have declined significantly
over the past year.</P>
      <P>Among others, Taiwan's videogame software piracy rate dropped to
42 percent last year from a high of 56 percent in 2002. The music
recording piracy rate fell to 42 percent from 47 percent in 2002 and
commercial software piracy rate declined to 43 percent from 53
percent.</P>
      <P>"All these rates were the world's fastest. In recognition of our
anti-piracy achievements, the United States has removed Taiwan from
its Special 301 'priority watch' list of countries for copyright
violation monitoring and instead included Taiwan on the less serious
'watch' list this year," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that the government will not be complacent about the
accomplishments and will continue stepping up the crackdown on
commercial piracy.</P>
      <P>During this era of knowledge-based economy, Chen said, knowledge
has replaced commodities as the most important niche for economic
development and creativity has replaced efficiency as the key to
industrial upgrading.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen went on, IPR protection is no longer
just a commercial issue but rather a pivotal event crucial to overall
national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Global Village, Chen added, Taiwan is
obligated to boost IPR protection and fight piracy. He urged the
public not to buy, sell or produce pirated products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT, DPP SET FOR TAIPEI COUNTRY MAGISTRATE SHOWDOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chou
Hsi-wei will face a showdown against Lou Wen-jia, the candidate
nominated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , in the
race for Taipei county magistrate in December's city mayor and county
magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>Chou gained the candidacy after beating three other contesters in
the party primary Sunday.</P>
      <P>Although Chou won the support of the largest number of KMT
members, observers predicted that he will have to first overcome
difficulties in forging unity within the party and mending
differences with the People First Party (PFP) , an ally in the "pan
blue alliance" led by the KMT, if he is to secure a win over Lou in
the year-end election in the Taiwan's largest county.</P>
      <P>It will be a difficult task for Chou to repair relations with KMT
competitors that have complained about what they claim was the
primary's unfairness and reach a comprise with the PFP, which has
said it will also put forth an aspirant to run in the election,
political analysts said.</P>
      <P>The situation will be made even more difficult when weighing the
key fact that Taipei county has been under DPP rule since 1989 due to
a split in the "pan blue alliance" in the last elections, they noted.</P>
      <P>December's election for Taipei county magistrate will be a
similar race -- one that the analysts said will be dominated by a
keen competition between the "pan blue alliance" and the "pan green
camp" of the ruling DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>Only a united "pan blue alliance" will be able to counter a
strong "pan green camp, " they said, adding that neither camp can
afford to lose the support of their allies.</P>
      <P>Although it seems that Lou has gained the high ground in the
campaign, sources close to the DPP said that Lou is also facing
pressure in his party due to dissatisfaction among the supporters of
Executive Yuan Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan, who was also trying
hard to gain the party's nomination. Lou was a former chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT will present the name list of five primary
winners, including Chou, for approval by the party's policy-making
Central Standing Committee (CSC) in its weekly meeting Wednesday.
The CSC is scheduled to wrap up the KMT's nomination for the December
elections Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Teh-fu, head of the KMT's Taipei county
committee, said he will do his best to negotiate with the PFP and
seek its support on fielding a common candidate that is approved by
the "pan blue alliance."</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the PFP's stance has been the focal point in the
domestic political spectrum with regard to whether it will continue
to line up with the KMT or align with the DPP, based on a foundation
built upon a meeting between PFP Chairman James Soong and President
Chen Shui-bian, or whether it will opt to take its own path by
fielding candidates at the cost of "pan blue" unity.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-fang, a well-known PFP lawmaker, said Sunday that the
party is poised to put forth its own candidates in promising
constituencies regardless of pressure from the KMT and despite the
fact that there is a big overlap in public backing between the two
parties.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the PFP stands a good chance of wining in
Keelung city, Changhua county, Nantou county, Taoyuan county and
Kaohsiung county. The party is expected to announce its nominees for
some of these constituencies in the coming days.</P>
      <P>December's elections are expected to serve as a turning point for
the PFP to determine its future course -- siding with either the KMT
or the DPP or risking being marginalized for insisting on walking the
middle road amid fierce political wrangling between the "pan blue"
and the "pan green" forces.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BREAKTHROUGH SEEN IN WASTE WATER RECYCLING EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has recently achieved a breakthrough
in ecological engineering technology developed to control river and
lake pollution, with the completion of the country's first
underground "soil absorption" system in a military base in Taipei
County.</P>
      <P>The system, built based on the theory of biodegradation, has
proved to be able to recycle around 260 tons of waste water produced
by 1,200 servicemen in the military base in Yingge township every
day, officials of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The purifying rate reached over 77 percent, allowing the military
compound to recycle its daily waste water, including that flowing
from kitchens and septic tanks, for cleaning use, the officials said,
explaining that the water purified by the system has already proved
to be good for car-washing, cleaning and watering. </P>
      <P>The underground soil absorption system works very well, according
to Wei Wen-yi of the EPA department of water quality protection.</P>
      <P>Moreover, unlike the normal wetlands used in waste water
treatment, the new pollution control-oriented facility can also offer
greenland for other public establishments because it is constructed
underground, Wei added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former U.S. White House official said
recently he could not answer the question of whether Taiwan is part
of China.</P>
      <P>Kenneth Lieberthal, a University of Michigan professor who once
served as senior director of Asian affairs under the White House
National Security Council during the Clinton administration, took the
question after delivering a speech on the Taiwan Strait issue at the
Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank, last week.</P>
      <P>A young audience member said during the question-and-answer
session that he was baffled about whether Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>Lieberthal said he could not answer such a question because he is
not a historian.</P>
      <P>Noting that there have been a myriad of discourses about this
issue politically and academically, Lieberthal said he could not
provide an answer, since he primarily deals with "political reality"
rather than historical analyses.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Lieberthal continued to advocate that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait shelve their sovereignty disputes and sign
a long-term agreement on "no pursuit of independence by Taiwan and no
use of force by China against Taiwan" to facilitate the maintenance
of the present status quo for 20 years, 30 years, 50 years or even
longer.</P>
      <P>Lieberthal reminded Taiwan and China that time is limited for
them to work out a viable framework for peaceful interaction and said
2007 could be the best timing for the two sides to complete the
establishment of a mechanism for peaceful engagements.</P>
      <P>As to whether the two sides can resume dialogue, Lieberthal said
the next six or 12 months will be an important period for any
possible developments.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After the ad hoc National Assembly votes to
pass a constitutional amendment package Tuesday, the Presidential
Office will embark on preparations for the second phase of
constitutional reforms, Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu
Shyi-kun said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks as the mission-oriented National Assembly
started to convene for the day and was scheduled to vote Tuesday on a
constitutional amendment package adopted by the Legislative Yuan last
August.</P>
      <P>Yu said that in the past, constitutional reforms were conducted
without the direct involvement of the public and that after the
passage of the constitutional amendment package, the public will be
directly involved in future constitutional amendments, which he said
is significant.</P>
      <P>Major items in the package include reducing the number of
legislative seats from the present 225 to 113 and adopting a "single
seat, two votes" legislative electoral system starting with the
seventh legislature to be elected in 2007, as well as phasing out the
National Assembly to allow for popular referendums on future
constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>A 75 percent majority vote is required for the passage of any
amendments and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
opposition Kuomintang, which are in favor of the package, together
control 80 percent of the seats in the National Assembly.</P>
      <P>If the package passes smoothly, Chen will invite the DPP
delegates to the National Assembly to a luncheon to express his
appreciation for their efforts, Yu said.</P>
      <P>He said that Chen has mentioned several times that the second
phase of constitutional reforms will involve such issues as whether
to have a three-branch or five-branch separation of power; whether to
adopt a presidential or parliamentary system of government; reform of
the national legislature and relevant articles; whether to suspend or
abolish the provincial government; lowering of the minimum voting
age; modification of compulsory military service requirements; human
rights and labor rights protection; and the inclusion of a special
chapter on the well-being of aboriginal citizens in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>On the timetable for the second stage of constitutional reforms,
Yu said that Chen wishes to hand over a "timely, relevant and viable"
constitution when he steps down in 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAYOR DEPARTS FOR HONG KONG EN ROUTE TO BEIJING FOR UCLG MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu left for Hong Kong
Monday for an overnight layover on his way to Beijing to attend the
United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) World Council meetings.</P>
      <P>Hu said prior to his departure that the UCLG meetings are
inter-city conferences aimed at promoting mutual cooperation in urban
affairs.</P>
      <P>The mayor said he will refrain from any contact with Chinese
officials in private during his stay in Beijing and will also not
accept any arrangements that would denigrate the Republic of China's
status as an independent sovereign state.</P>
      <P>"The main purpose of my attendance at the UCLG activities is to
introduce Taichung's major industries, cultural development and
tourist attractions, " said Hu, who once served as minister of
foreign affairs and as representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>As a local government chief, Hu said, he will not touch on any
political issues or topics related to relations across the Taiwan
Strait during his visit.</P>
      <P>Hu further said the central government has not given him any
directives nor has asked him to convey any message to China.</P>
      <P>"Promoting city-to-city exchanges and upgrading Taichung's
international image and profile will be my only mission, " Hu
stressed.</P>
      <P>Hu said he has brought with him a large amount of two of
Taichung's delicacies -- Sun cakes and pineapple pastries -- to be
distributed to other conference-goers and Chinese journalists.</P>
      <P>"I'll catch this rare opportunity to introduce Taichung's unique
features and development potential to Chinese people, " Hu said,
adding that the UCLG meetings have offered him a rare opportunity for
exposure to the Chinese media.</P>
      <P>The UCLG World Council meetings are scheduled for June 8-10 in
Beijing. Over 300 mayors and city councilors will meet with
representatives from the World Bank and the United Nations in a World
Mayors Forum. The agenda will include how Asia-Pacific cities plan to
cope with contingencies or crises and the status of the city in the
new millennium.</P>
      <P>Hu is the second ROC local government chief to have obtained the
government's permission to visit China. In 2000, then-Hsinchu Mayor
Tsai Jen-chien was permitted to go to China to take part in a world
technology conference held in Nanjing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`ENERGY CONSERVATION SEASON' KICKS OFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An "Energy Conservation Season" sponsored by
the Energy Bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs kicked off
Monday with the slogan of "saving one unit of electricity per person
per day."</P>
      <P>Minister of the Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said in a ceremony
marking the start of the season that the cutting of greenhouse gas
emissions has become a cause of great public concern since the Kyoto
Protocol on climate change took effect in February.</P>
      <P>Ho said cutting the consumption of electricity is the most
effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions because most
electricity is generated by burning fossil fuel, which produces
carbon dioxide, the major component of the so-called greenhouse
gases.</P>
      <P>This is all the more pressing during the summer, when the
consumption of electricity peaks, which is why the Energy Bureau came
up with the idea of the "Energy Conservation Season" from June to
August, the minister said.</P>
      <P>By saving only unit of electricity per day per capita, Ho said,
the country will save 8.4 billion units in one year, which is worth
NT$21 billion and 2.3 times the total electricity produced in a year
by the country's Linkou Thermo Power Station. This will thereby reduce
carbon dioxide emissions by 5.8 million tons, an amount that would
take 390,000 hectares of trees a whole year to process.</P>
      <P>The MOEA Energy Bureau offered some tips for saving electricity,
for example turning up the temperature of the air conditioners by one
degree Celsius, switching off the electric hot drinking water
suppliers in the summer, turning off lights when leaving a room, not
riding elevators when going up or down within three floors, and
buying electrical appliances with energy saving marks.</P>
      <P>A copy of the tips will be sent by the Taiwan Power Company to
their customers along with their next electricity bills.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage the public to cut their electricity
consumption, the power company will offer prizes to winners chosen
through a raffle for consumers who use less electricity in August and
September than they did in the same months of last year.</P>
      <P>Other activities include road racing, a trade fair of
energy-conserving products, public speeches on energy conservation, a
competition for energy conservation songs and the spread of
energy-conserving technology, according to Ho.</P>

clearly. In the use of his ears, his object is to hear distinctly. In
the expression of his look, his object is to be gracious.

"In his manners, his object is to be serious. In what he says,
his object is to be sincere, In business, his object is to be
earnest. In doubt, his object is to seek information. In anger, his
object is to think of consequences. In view of personal advantage,
his object is to think of what is right."</TEXT>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Tuesday that China, based on its "zero-sum" mentality, is using every
possible means to block Taiwan from entering the Organization of
American States (OAS).</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks following the release
of a U.S. Congressional Research Service (CRS) report that since
China became an observer in the OAS last year, it has vehemently
opposed Taiwan joining the organization as an observer. Beijing has
also taken the opportunity to develop relations with Taiwan's
diplomatic allies in the organization and to continue to suppress
Taiwan internationally, according to the CRS report.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that 12 of the 34 members of the OAS are diplomatic
allies of Taiwan and that the other members have maintained
substantial relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been actively trying to become an observer in the OAS,
and the United States is supporting its bid, but China is doing
everything possible to block the island's entry, Lu added.</P>
      <P>China's "zero-sum" mentality has led Beijing to attempt to
marginalize Taiwan in every possible way, Lu said, adding that this
has posed a great challenge to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu expressed the hope that the public will understand the
situation and that domestic businesses will come out in force to
invest in central America to help the nation cement ties with its
diplomatic allies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANCER REMAINS TAIWAN'S TOP KILLER FOR 23RD STRAIGHT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cancer kept its title as Taiwan's top killer
in 2004, remaining as the leading cause of death in the country for
the 23rd year in a row, the Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Heart disease, stroke, diabetes, accidents, pneumonia, chronic
liver disease, kidney disease, suicide and hypertension rounded out
the top 10 list in that order last year, according to DOH statistics
released Thursday.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, DOH officials said, the order of the top 10
did not change much from the previous year. The only changes were
that heart disease and stroke switched places, while pneumonia and
chronic liver disease switched spots.</P>
      <P>More than 133,000 Taiwan people died in 2004, marking a
2.9-percent increase over the figure for the previous year.
Seventy-five percent of the deaths were caused by one of the top 10
killers, according to the DOH statistics.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsu-ming, chief of the DOH's statistics department, said
that the number of the people dying from hypertension has been
gradually declining over the past ten years, with the death rate
dropping from 10.96 per 100,000 people in 1994 to 7.97 per 100,000
people last year.</P>
      <P>Over the same period, the number of suicides has been steadily
increasing, from a rate of 6.24 out of every 100,000 people in 1994
to 15.31 per 100,000 people last year, Huang said.</P>
      <P>As for the top killer, Huang said, cancer claimed one life in
Taiwan every 14 minutes and 27 seconds on average last year.</P>
      <P>A total of 36,357 Taiwan people died of cancer last year, with
liver cancer and lung cancer claiming about 40 percent of those
lives, according to the DOH tallies. Colo-rectal cancer, breast
cancer, gastric cancer, oral cancer, cervical cancer, prostate
cancer, cancer of the esophagus, and pancreatic cancer rounded out

    <HEADLINE>NO SENSITIVE POLITICAL ISSUES FOR  NEXT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS: YU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's plan to introduce
additional constitutional reforms will not touch on sensitive
political issues; rather it will deal with issues that are of major
concern to society, Presidential Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while answering questions from reporters at
the Chungshan Building in Yangmingshan, where the members of an
ad-hoc National Assembly were voting on a package of constitutional
amendments that include the adoption of "a single seat, two votes"
electoral system, reducing the number of seats at the Legislative
Yuan by almost half and granting referendum power to the public to
decide constitutional amendments proposed by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the president hopes to promote a new round of
constitutional reforms soon after the National Assembly completes its
current session which is expected to end later in the day.</P>
      <P>Instead of controversial political issues, such as changing
Taiwan's official designation, an option for independence or
unification and a redefinition of national sovereignty or territory,
issues related to the governmental system, lowering the voting age
and reforming the military conscription system will be the
centerpieces of the planned new constitutional reforms, he said.</P>
      <P>The president will do his best to seek comprehensive
understanding and communication with the opposition parties and will
fully respect their opinions to forge a consensus, the top
presidential aide said.</P>
      <P>Lin Fong-cheng, secretary-general of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , criticized the second phase of constitutional
reforms proposed by Chen as impractical.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the people of Taiwan are looking forward to better
livelihoods, Lin urged the government to focus on improving Taiwan's
economy and cross-Taiwan Strait ties. The ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) must not rashly start a fresh round of
constitutional reforms only to win political capital without having
gained a national consensus, he said.</P>
      <P>Shieh Kung-ping, spokesman for the People First Party (PFP) ,
quoted PFP Chairman James Soong as accusing Chen of violating the
Constitution by pushing for a new phase of constitutional reforms
since doing so goes against the principles in a democratic nation.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, the president and the ruling DPP must abide
by and take the lead to implement the Constitution instead of
repeatedly violating it, Shieh said. He added that the PFP will never
agree to a new round of constitutional revisions.</P>
      <P>Soong was quoted by Hsieh as saying that the president's
initiative to amend the Constitution is in violation of the law, as
constitutional amendments proposals should be put forth by the
Legislative Yuan, not the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office's proposal to set up a constitutional
amending committee under its jurisdiction is totally illegal, Hsieh
cited Soong as saying and pointing out that the PFP is firmly opposed
to the DPP's scheme to play with popularism in disguise of its
inability to effectively rule the country.</P>
      <P>The issues that the president wants to include in the next round
of constitutional reforms can be improved through the regular process
of legislation or by coordination in execution by related government
agencies, Hsieh said, claiming that it is not necessary to resort to
amending the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Su Ching-chiang, chairman of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) ,
blasted the current round of constitutional revisions as suicide that
will kill the lifeline of Taiwan's democracy, referring to the high
three-fourths majority vote by the lawmakers jointly supported by the
DPP and the KMT for future referendums on constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>Although the TSU's wish to create a new constitution for Taiwan
remains far off, Su said that the party will not give up its dream.</P>
      <P>The DPP and the KMT together hold 244 seats at the 300-member
National Assembly, that will be immediately dissolved and pass into
history following the current session.</P>

      <P>If President Chen Shui-bian's administration
has its way, overhauling the tax system will level the playing field
for taxpayers and will certainly not make poor people poorer as
former President Lee Teng-hui has alleged, Premier Frank Hsieh said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks while addressing a ceremony to install new
caucus leaders of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) at the
Legislative Yuan. Lee is the TSU's spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, the premier ordered the formation of a special
task force to work out tax reform measures in line with President
Chen's directive. He said in his address to TSU legislators that
reforms will be conducted in three major directions -- making taxes
fair, expanding the tax base and increasing the sources of tax
revenues.</P>
      <P>He said the reason the government hopes to reform the tax system
is so that everyone can share in the benefits of the nation's
economic growth, referring to the national health insurance system
and social welfare.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the new panel, which will be headed by himself,
will meet this week and begin discussing ways to define the lowest
tax rate for ordinary taxpayers.</P>
      <P>President Chen announced a six-point tax reform plan on May 30
after presiding over a meeting of the Presidential Office Economic
Advisory Panel. He said that the reform program will focus on
expanding the tax base, restructuring and simplifying the tax system

registered Tuesday to run for party chairman in the July 16 election.</P>

      <P>Wang said the encouragement of current KMT Chairman Lien Chan as

      <P>Wang pledged to rejuvenate the century-old KMT and bring about a
more optimistic future for the Republic of China, which he said has
been put to a real test over the past five years since the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) came to power.</P>
      <P>Saying cross-Taiwan Strait tensions have escalated and that
society in Taiwan has become divided, Wang said his goal after
becoming the next KMT chairman will be to push for a second
transition of power so that the KMT can once again lead the country.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT should play a positive role in the Legislative

"single district, two votes" electoral system as well as reducing the
number of legislative seats from 225 to 113.</P>
      <P>National Assembly Secretary-General Yeh Jiunn-rong said within
three days the assembly will request the president to promulgate the
amendments.</P>
      <P>Under the amendments, the National Assembly, which had powers to
vote on constitutional amendments, territorial boundary changes and
the impeachment of the president and vice president proposed by the
Legislative Yuan, ceases to exist.</P>
      <P>Future constitutional amendments and territorial boundary changes

      <P>A proposal to impeach the president or vice president that is
initiated by over 50 percent of legislators and endorsed by over

Justices for consideration. The president or vice president will be
removed from duty if the impeachment is determined valid by the
constitutional court.</P>
      <P>Starting from the seventh legislature to be elected in 2007, the
Legislative Yuan will have only 113 seats and will be elected every
four years. While 73 seats will be elected from regional districts,
there will be six seats for aboriginal representatives and 34 seats
for at-large and overseas expatriate representatives.</P>
      <P>The regional seats will be distributed among special
municipalities, counties and cities according to their populations,
with each locality enjoying at least one seat and one legislator
elected from each district. The at-large and overseas expatriate
seats will be allocated to political parties that win at least 5
percent of the votes, according to the proportion of votes they
garner, with each party required to reserve at least 50 percent of
the seats for women.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP, TSU TO FEEL IMPACT OF NEW ELECTORAL SYSTEM: OBSERVERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's smaller political parties are set
to encounter survival difficulties in future elections now that the
National Assembly has approved a "single seat, two votes" electoral
system in a constitutional revision session that took place Tuesday,
according to political analysts.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, only 113 lawmakers will be elected to the
next Legislative Yuan, a sharp reduction from the 225 seats in the
current 6th Legislative Yuan that will end early 2008.</P>
      <P>As the new system is widely viewed as more favorable to larger
parties -- namely the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- due to fiercer competition
for fewer seats in smaller constituencies, candidates of the People
First Party (PFP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) are very
likely to be crowded out in future elections, analysts predicted.</P>
      <P>However, they expressed worry that in the future, legislative
committees, which will be controlled by just a few lawmakers, will
invite intervention by vested interest groups.</P>
      <P>The analysts also expressed concern that the "one seat, two
votes" system will fuel competition between the pro-independence DPP
and the pro-unification KMT, further aggravating the polarized
political wrangling dominated by the "pan green camp" led by the DPP
and the "pan blue alliance" led by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Currently, the "pan green camp" enjoys wider public support in
southern Taiwan, while the "pan blue alliance" enjoys a noticeable
advantage in the north.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Huang Yi-jiau said candidates of smaller parties
must be devoted to serving the public to gain votes amid the
aggressive competition that will arise from the changes in the
electoral system and from a legislature that will be cut by nearly
half.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chung Shao-ho said a leaner Legislative Yuan will
create stronger pressure on both the KMT and the PFP to consolidate
to secure "pan blue" victory in coming elections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng Cheng-long, secretary-general of the TSU, the
ally of the ruling DPP in the "pan green camp, " was not so
pessimistic about the party's prospects, although he did not deny the
fact that a streamlined legislature will represent a smaller slice of
the pie for all the competitors.</P>
      <P>Saying he does not think the TSU will become a "burst bubble" in
the short term, Cheng added that the party must cement and broaden
its public support base through enhanced organization and in-depth
theoretical discourse to expound its stance and attract new blood.</P>
      <P>Various other TSU lawmakers were of the view that the KMT will
benefit the most from the electoral system changes and they called
for negotiations with the DPP as soon as possible to jointly take on
the challenges in December's city mayor and county magistrate
elections.</P>
      <P>Neither party in the "pan green camp" can afford a split if they
want to win in the year-end elections, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO START SECOND PHASE OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
he will formally start the next phase of amending the ROC
Constitution now that the mission-oriented National Assembly voted
earlier in the day to pass a constitutional amendment package.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks while receiving members of
the Asian Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The president noted that the Legislative Yuan, responding to the
aspiration of the people, adopted the constitutional amendment
package across the party spectrum last August and that he was glad to
see the ad hoc National Assembly pass the package 249-48 so that they
could formally became part of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The proposals include reducing the number of seats in the
legislature from the current 225 to 113, extending the terms for
legislators from the current three years to four years, adopting a
"single seat, two ballots" legislative electoral system, phasing out
the National Assembly, holding popular referendums on future
constitutional amendments, and empowering the Council of Grand
Justices to screen presidential and vice presidential impeachment
proposals.</P>
      <P>"This is not the end of constitutional reform, but a new start,"
the president said, adding that after the completion of the first
stage, the second phase of constitutional re-engineering will begin.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that he wants to hand over a "timely, relevant and
viable" constitution to Taiwan when he steps down in 2008.</P>
      <P>The president also said that he will base subsequent amendments
on "fairness and neutrality."</P>
      <P>He said that constitutional reform will not only be a reform of
the system, but will be the best democratic and constitutional reform
education for the people.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that he will speed up the formation of a
constitutional reform committee, inviting all political parties as
well as people from all walks of life to participate to allow the
public to be fully engaged in the constitutional reform discussion,
forge a national consensus and form a new collective sense of the
nation.</P>
      <P>Chen has mentioned several times that the second phase of
constitutional reform will involve such issues as whether to have a
three-branch or five-branch separation of power; whether to adopt a
presidential or parliamentary system of government; reform of the
national legislature and relevant articles; whether to suspend or
abolish the provincial government; lowering of the minimum voting
age; modification of compulsory military service requirements; human
rights and labor rights protection; and the inclusion of a special
chapter on the well-being of aboriginal citizens in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, who
went to the Chungshan Building on Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei to
ask DPP delegates to the National Assembly to toe the party line and
vote in favor of the package, said though various parties had
different views, the result was perfect.</P>
      <P>President Chen will host a dinner for all DPP delegates to
express his appreciation for their efforts. Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairman Su Tseng-chang also said that all 127 DPP
delegates strictly toed the party line and delivered on the party's
promise of reform to the people.</P>
      <P>Su also expressed appreciation for the Kuomintang, whose 117
delegates also voted "yes" unanimously on the package, adding that
the DPP will continue working for democratic reforms.</P>

      <P>Two mayors from Taiwan, along with
over 200 heads of cities around the world, committed themselves to
making more efforts to green the Earth by signing a "green cities
declaration" before the United Nation-sponsored World Environment Day
(WED) 2005 activities ended in San Francisco Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair and Deputy Taipei Mayor Yeh
Ching-chuan signed the "Urban Environment Accords," which designate a
number of concrete goals in the development of ecologically
sustainable urban centers.</P>
      <P>The goals include reducing their respective jurisdictions'
emissions of greenhouse gases by 25 percent by 2030, achieving zero
waste added to landfills and incinerators by 2040, ensuring there is
an accessible public park or recreational open space within
half-a-kilometer of every city resident by 2015, and increasing
adequate access to safe drinking water, aiming at access for all by
2015.</P>
      <P>World Environment Day, which falls on June 5 each year, is one of
the principal vehicles through which the U.N. tries to raise global
awareness of the environment and enhance political attention and
action in environmental protection affairs.</P>
      <P>The 2005 WED activities, hosted by San Francisco, was held June
1-5, with a total of 250 mayors from cities around the world,
including 17 mayors from China and two from Taiwan, invited to
attend.</P>
      <P>However, all the Chinese mayors boycotted the event because of
the invitations extended by the organizers to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Regarding China's protest, both Hsu and Yeh said that they came
to San Francisco to trade ideas with other cities on issues that will
create a better living environment for people, and that they had no
intention to raise political tension.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Olympic Bid Hurt as New
York Fails in West Side Stadium Quest.

New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's nearly four-year quest to
build a Manhattan football stadium that could spark the redevelopment
of the West Side and lure the Olympic Games to New York was defeated
yesterday when City Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Joseph L.
Bruno, the Senate majority leader, refused to approve the US$2.2
billion projec. The decision by the state's Public Authorities
Control Board, makes it far more difficult, if not impossible, for
the city to guarantee the construction of an Olympic stadium, a
prerequisite to its bid. Just hours earlier, the International
Olympic Committee released a report generally praising New York's
bid, but calling attention to the stadium's uncertainty. Paris's
proposal drew unqualified praise. In less than four weeks, the
Olympic committee plans to pick Paris, London, Madrid, Moscow or New
York for the site of the Summer Games.

Wall Street Journal: Virtual Battle, How a Global Web of
Activists Gives Coke Problems in India.

Amit Srivastava who runs a nonprofit, activist organization in
California has been helping shake up one of the world's biggest
corporations, Coca-Cola Co., thousands of miles away in India.
Srivastava is rallying college stude ntsin the U.S. and Europe to
take up the NGOs'cause. Under pressure from student protesters, at
least a half-dozen colleges have decided not to renew contracts with
Coke or boycott it, and other campuses are considering similar
action. Even though he lives in Northern California, Srivastava has
emerged as a key figure in Coke's travails in India. That a one- man
NGO armed with just a laptop computer, a Web site and a telephone
calling card can, with his allies, influence a huge multinational
corporation illustrates the role social activists can play in a world

    <HEADLINE>`PEOPLE POWER' WILL ENSURE SUCCESS OF NEW CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday that as long as
"people show their power," the second phase of constitutional reforms
can succeed.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, made the
remarks after the opposition parties responded in a lukewarm fashion
to President Chen Shui-bian's advocacy of formally starting the next
stage of constitutional reform after the ad hoc National Assembly
passed a constitutional amendment package 249-48 earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>The package includes reducing the number of seats in the

"single seat, two ballots" legislative electoral system, phasing out
the National Assembly, holding popular referendums on future

proposals.</P>
      <P>The legislator claimed that despite the lukewarm response from
the opposition parties, it is "urgent" to start the second phase of
reforms so that Taiwan can become a "normal and great country."</P>
      <P>He said that under the present constitutional system, Taiwan has
neither a presidential nor a cabinet system. The issue of compulsory
military service, as well as the inclusion of a special chapter in
the Constitution on the well-being of aboriginal citizens also
requires discussion, he added.</P>
      <P>"Economic issues are important, but so is the sustainable
development of Constitution," he said, referring to criticism by the
main opposition Kuomintang that people are more concerned about
improving the economy.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP legislative caucus fully supports the president's
promotion of the second phase of constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>"The opposition parties should come to terms with reality and not
try to boycott the reforms," he said, adding that Chen is resolved to
embark on the reforms and that the people will also display their
power, which the opposition should not underestimate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TOUTS TAX REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian accentuated again
Tuesday what he described as the urgency and necessity of tax
reforms, saying that the reform proposals he unveiled recently are
aimed at broadening the tax base, establishing a fair taxation
system, achieving effective use of resources and promoting
investment.</P>
      <P>Chen said the reforms will require high-income earners to
shoulder a heavier tax burden, which he said is consistent with
social justice and fairness.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a meeting with
representatives of the Asia Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that although Taiwan is ranked the world's 11th
most competitive country in the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2005
released last month by the Switzerland-based International Institute
for Management Development (IMD), its ranking in the "public finance"
criterion has fallen.</P>
      <P>This situation shows that financial reforms are imperative, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He noted that fiscal imbalance of the government has continued
for a long time and that to tackle the problem, the Cabinet finalized
in 2003 a financial reform package intended to achieve fiscal balance
in five to 10 years.</P>
      <P>The tax reform proposals that he unveiled last week are also
designed to exhibit the government's resolve to carry out financial
reforms, he said.</P>
      <P>These include raising the national tax rate to 15 percent in
three years from the current 13.6 percent and further to 18 percent
as a mid-term goal; reviewing the rates of commodity tax, stamp tax,
business tax, inheritance tax and gift tax; establishing a minimum
tax system targeting high-income earners; and simplifying the tax
system.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, these proposals were worked out after taking
into consideration the advantages and disadvantages they involve.</P>
      <P>He said the government should continue to try to increase
government and corporate investment to expand its revenue instead of
focusing the reforms on tax cuts and tax hikes.</P>
      <P>He predicted that a backlash and differences over the tax reforms
will be inevitable during the remaining three years of his term, but
he said he will endure the pressure and take the challenge in order
to fulfill his responsibility and obligations as the nation's leader.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAUDS PERFORMANCE OF PARTY NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MEMBERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan praised the performance of the party's National Assembly members
after the National Assembly approved as expected a package of
constitutional amendments Tuesday.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng told a news conference at
the Chungshan Building on Yangmingshan, venue of the National
Assembly, that Lien was pleased that all 117 of the party's National
Assembly members had toed the party line by voting for the
amendments.</P>
      <P>Although some parties had backed away from promises they made
last August to support the amendments, Lin said his party has stuck
to its guns, which he claimed shows that the KMT is a responsible
party.</P>
      <P>Calling the revisions of the Constitution only the beginning of a
long process of political reform, Lin said a lot remains to be done
and that the KMT will try to unite the followers of the "pan blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party to present a united
front.</P>
      <P>After the numerous twists and turns involved in the process of
altering the Constitution, Lin said the people need to take a break
and redirect their attention to improving their livelihoods.
Therefore, he went on, the party will not support the president's
idea of starting preparations for another phase of constitutional
reforms in 2007.</P>
      <P>KMT convener in the National Assembly Chen Chin-jang said at the
news conference that the rapid approval of the amendments proves that
the National Assembly has done what it was mandated to do and he
claimed that the media's criticism of the ad hoc group as being
inefficient and greedy is "unfair."</P>
      <P>In a related development Tuesday, KMT Legislator Cheng
Yung-chuan, who is the director of the party's Policy Coordination
Committee, said the KMT caucus in the Legislative Yuan will make the
enactment of the organic law of the Central Election Commission a
priority in the next legislative session now that the commission is
set to redraw the voting districts for lawmakers after the revised
Constitution cut the number of lawmakers by half.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that the commission does not gerrymander while
redrawing the constituencies, it is vital to shield the commission
from political influence in its organic law.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Huang Teh-fu said the party is trying to make the
commission a mirror of the legislature by having its members
nominated by various political parties in proportion to their
legislative seats.</P>
      <P>Also, Huang said, the constituencies redrawn by the Central
Election Commission should be subject to the approval of the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the commission was downgraded into a rubber stamp
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in 2004 when it agreed to
hold a national referendum along with the presidential election and
to set the legislative election day on December 11, 2004, which he
claimed favored the DPP.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, the redivision of voting districts should
take effect only one year after being promulgated. Since the next
legislative election is due by the end of 2007, the new boundaries of
the various voting district must be made public before the end of
2006.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 6 (CNA)
(By C.F. Lee and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission Chairman Richard D'Amato urged Washington Monday to review
its "one China" policy based on the new developments across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He made the call while meeting a group of Taiwanese journalists
who are visiting the United States under the leadership of Mainland
Affairs Council Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng.</P>
      <P>D'Amato said it is "unwise and mistaken" for China's leaders to
bypass the duly elected government in Taiwan and discuss cross-strait
affairs with the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing, which insists on making the "one China"
principle a precondition for government-to-government cross-strait
talks, is obviously not ready to resume official dialogue with
Taipei, D'Amato observed.</P>
      <P>He said the United States should play a more active role to help
the resumption of cross-strait dialogue and review its vague "one
China" policy to avoid misunderstandings and reduce cross-strait
tension.</P>
      <P>According to Heritage Foundation research fellow John J. Tkacik,
Washington has never recognized Taiwan as part of China, although it
"acknowledges" Beijing's claim to the contrary.</P>
      <P>Tkacik proposed that the U.S. government specify openly that its
"one China" policy does not mean it recognizes Taiwan as part of
China and said he believes China will reconsider its policy toward
Taiwan if this stand of Washington is made clear to Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT: CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS SET STAGE FOR FURTHER REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The just-passed constitutional amendments
have set the stage for another and more radical phase of
constitutional reform, President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a dinner party hosted by the president for National Assembly
members of his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , Chen said his
administration takes heart from the success of the first phase of
constitutional reforms that ended with the passage of five amendments
Tuesday, and vowed to speed up the next phase of reforms with the
purpose of giving the country a constitution tailored to its needs.</P>
      <P>When his term expires in 2008, Chen said, he hopes a constitution
suitable for the country will be in place along with a new president,
new administration, a new legislature and a new era.</P>
      <P>Chen said the first constitutional reforms, especially the
abolition of the National Assembly, has destroyed the myth that the
the Constitution, as well as the five-branch government provided for
therein, is a vital and untouchable part of the country's legacy.</P>
      <P>By doing away with this myth, Chen said, the National Assembly
has removed a political taboo against revamping the Constitution
thoroughly, and has prepared the public for more radical changes to
the Constitution, Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>"It has convinced people that the Constitution should serve their
interests rather than maintain a fictitious legacy," he said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he went on, the amendments also give people the
final say in future constitutional amendments through referendum and
thereby make them the real masters of the country, which is
unprecedented in the country's history.</P>
      <P>He thanked the opposition Kuomintang for its support for the
amendments and promised to give the country a more active leadership
in the second phase of constitutional reforms.</P>
      <P>The president's exuberance was shared by his guests at the dinner
party, with Vice President Annette Lu admiring him as "the engineer
of constitutional reform" and Chen's chief of staff Yu Shyi-kun
saying the passage of the amendments is a success for the DPP and the
Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said at the party that Taiwan's
democracy takes a big jump forward with the passage of the amendments
and will be even better when the president finishes his second phase
of constitutional reforms in 2007.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER TO SEEK APOLOGY, COMPENSATION IN JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Aboriginal Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei is
scheduled to lead a Taiwan group to Japan next Monday to seek an
apology and compensation from the Japanese government for the
Taiwanese aborigines who were killed during World War II in combat as
drafted Japanese Imperial Army soldiers.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held at the Legislative Yuan, Kao Chin, a
member of the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, said she will travel to
Japan with a group of 60 aborigines who are offspring of members of
the Taiwanese Kaosha Warriors Group who were forced to fight for the
Japanese army during World War II.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin and her group will primarily demand that the Japanese
government remove the tablets for the Kaosha Warriors Group from the
Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. Discounting Yasukuni authorities' earlier
statements that the Taiwanese aboriginal warriors have already become
"gods" and nobody has the right to decide their fate, Kao Chin said
that the Kaosha warriors are not Japanese and their "confined souls
should be released and allowed to return to their home in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Calling the "shackling of the warriors' souls" in Japan the
"saddest event in the history of Taiwan's aboriginal people, " Kao
Chin said that her people will travel to Japan one group after
another in a bid to "release" their ancestors' souls in their own
way.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin and her group will also demand an open apology from the
Japanese government for Japan's atrocities committed in Taiwan during
the war as well as compensation for the Taiwanese aborigines who were
killed in battles during the war.</P>
      <P>Documentaries showing Taiwanese telling of how Taiwan's
aborigines were slaughtered or tortured by the Japanese during the
period of Japanese colonial rule were also shown at the press
conference.</P>
      <P>The Yasukuni Shrine, situated in central Tokyo just outside the
moat to the Imperial Palace, is dedicated to the some 2.46 million
people who died in battle for Japan between 1853 and 1945, including
1,068 convicted war criminals.</P>

it was necessary that this (China's military buildup) needed to be
done."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh expressed the hope
Wednesday that the Central Election Commission will demarcate the new
constituencies fairly.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in an Executive Yuan floor meeting while
commenting on the constitutional amendments passed by the National
Assembly a day earlier, which include changing the electoral system
from the current multiple seats in one constituency to a "single
seat, two votes" format, as well as reducing the number of
legislative seats from 225 to 113.</P>
      <P>Starting from the seventh legislature to be elected in 2007, the
Legislative Yuan will have only 113 seats and will be elected every
four years. While 73 seats will be elected from regional districts,
there will be six seats for aboriginal representatives and 34 seats
for at-large and overseas expatriate representatives.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that the passing of the constitutional amendments
marked the first step of reform and that the follow-up task will be
for the Executive Yuan to amend the laws and redraw the constituency
boundaries.</P>
      <P>He described the demarcation of constituencies as "a politically
charged task" and said the issue has been controversial in the
experience of many other countries.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the CEC will solicit views from all
sides on the demarcation of the new constituencies so that the task
can be carried out in a "fair and objective" manner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER WELCOME TO OFFER '319 SHOOTING' CLUES: CIB HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
Commissioner Hou You-yi urged independent Legislator Li Ao Wednesday
to provide the police with a copy of an intelligence document that Li
claims to have acquired from the United States to help solve the
March 19, 2004 presidential election-eve shooting.</P>
      <P>Li claimed earlier in the day that he holds intelligence
information obtained from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
indicating that the real shooter in the 319 shooting is a man
surnamed Lee who remains at large even though Taiwan law enforcement
authorities have left no stone unturned in their investigations since
March 20 last year.</P>
      <P>Hou urged Li to provide relevant information to the CIB, saying
that the police hold no prerequisites or assumptions of any kind
regarding the case and that his bureau would welcome any information
that could lead to solving the case.</P>
      <P>Li also said that he will mail Vice President Annette Lu a copy
of the CIA intelligence information, which he said shows that the
shooter was targeting Lu alone in an attempt to wound her.</P>
      <P>A "319 truth investigation commission" was formed last October
under a statute passed by the opposition-dominated Legislative Yuan,
but the commission got nowhere because it encountered heavy criticism
and the Council of Grand Justices ruled the all-powerful commission
unconstitutional and the administration refused to cooperate with it.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" claims that the shooting and
the ensuing activation of a national security mechanism barred many
police and military servicemen -- traditionally supporters of the
"pan-blue alliance" -- from leaving their posts to vote, unfairly
swaying the election in Chen's favor. The alliance filed two lawsuits
to challenge the election and the result of the election, both of
which were thrown out by the courts because the plaintiffs failed to
provide any evidence to support their allegations.</P>
      <P>A grueling full recount of the votes demanded by the "pan-blue
alliance" confirmed that Chen won the election by a margin of a
little more than 25,000 votes, instead of the original figure of
29,518 votes, out of more than 13 million ballots cast.</P>
      <P>Although a number of people were questioned and investigated, and
even though the CIB claimed earlier this year that "major progress"
had been made, the shooting case remains unsolved.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICE PRAISED FOR UNCOVERING FAKE CLAIM BY TAIPEI POLITICIAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh commended the police
Wednesday for laying bare a false claim by a Taipei politician that
food offerings at funerals are being resold in the city for human
consumption.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Cabinet's weekly meeting, Hsieh said the incident
is one involving the credibility of a politician and has resulted in
widespread public distrust in the government and media.</P>
      <P>The efficient action taken by the Criminal Investigation Bureau
(CIB) has rebuilt public confidence in the government and has been
very helpful to social stability, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Councilor Wang Yu-cheng of the opposition People
First Party (PFP) released filmed images last week that he claimed
support his claim that workers at city government-run funeral parlors
are reselling funeral offerings to certain restaurants in the city
and that rice offered to the deceased is also being reused to process
preserved tofu.</P>
      <P>The claim triggered a public scare and reportedly affected the
business of many restaurants located at places insinuated by Wang as
where the funeral offerings ended up.</P>
      <P>However, CIB agents found out Tuesday that the alleged funeral
offering collectors appearing in the film were just actors, prompting
Wang to admit that the images were "simulated" and staged by his
hirelings. He apologized to the public for his sham.</P>
      <P>According to lawyer Kao Yung-cheng, the affected restaurants can
demand compensation from Wang if they can prove they have suffered
business losses as a result of the incident.</P>
      <P>Wang might also face criminal charges for making false
allegations, Kao said.</P>
      <P>Taipei city government spokesman Yu Tzu-hsiang said the city
government will not file a defamation suit against Wang because the
truth has been clarified.</P>
      <P>On offenses such as forgery and humiliating civil servants and a
government agency, in which Wang is also allegedly involved, Yu
pointed out that these are offenses subject to public prosecution and
that it will be up to prosecutors to determine if an indictment is
warranted.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, the PFP caucus at the Taipei city council
recommended that the party expel Wang over the incident. It also
apologized to the public for the panic and disturbance caused by
Wang.</P>
      <P>Caucus convener Wang Hsin-yi said using simulated images as if
they are true evidence is a serious offense that has not only
destroyed Wang's credibility but has also damaged the image of the
PFP, and that the caucus will not tolerate such behavior.</P>
      <P>A tearful Wang Yu-cheng said losing his PFP membership is "the
severest punishment" for what he claimed was his "failure to properly
supervise his assistants" and that he will consider resigning from
the post of Taipei city councilor to assume his "political
responsibility."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on behalf of the Taipei city council, speaker Wu
Pi-chu also apologized to the public for the uproar.</P>
      <P>Wu said she will advise councilors to be more careful about their
speeches and behavior in the future.</P>
      <P>Liu Yao-jen, a whip of the Democratic Progressive Party caucus at
the city council, said Wang should assume total responsibility
because his behavior has damaged the image of the city council.</P>
      <P>The councilors will discuss whether to refer Wang to the
disciplinary committee for punishment, Liu said.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: C.I.A. Is Reviewing Its
Security Policy for Recruiting Translators.

The Central Intelligence Agency of the Unites States is reviewing
security procedures that have led the agency to turn away large
numbers of Arabic-language linguists and other potential recruits
with skills avidly sought by the agency since the attacks of 2001,
Congressional and intelligence officials say. Many of those rejected,
the officials say, have been first-generation Americans who bring the
linguistic facility and cultural knowledge that the C.I.A. has been
trying to develop in seeking to improve its performance in
penetrating terrorist organizations and otherwise gathering
intelligence in the Middle East and South Asia. Among the
possibilities under review are revised standards for background
checks and the creation of new job categories subject to less
stringent requirements. But the C.I.A. is likely to resist anything
that would be perceived as a scaling back of security restrictions.

Wall Street Journal: GM Plans to Cut 25,000 Jobs By '08 in
Restructuring.

General Motors Corp., struggling with highcosts and declining
sales, unveiled plans to cut its North American work force by about
25,000 workers by 2008 as part of a broader restructuring, but the
plan drew mixed reviews from analysts and investors and skepticism
from the company's biggest union. GM's North American op erations,
which posted a loss of US$1.3 billion for the first quarter, already
have been eliminating about 8,000 jobs a year through a combination
of attrition and early-retirement programs since 2002, part of a
gradual decline in the size of its work force.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fishermen in Suao, northeastern Taiwan, will
mobilize between 60 and 70 fishing boats to an area off the coast of
northern Taiwan Thursday to stage a protest against Japanese patrol
ships.</P>
      <P>Suao fishery official Lin Kuang-hui noted that Taiwan's economic
zone overlaps that of Japan's and that when Taiwan fishing ships are
operating in waters off northern or northeastern Taiwan, they are
often chased away by Japanese patrol ships.</P>
      <P>A large number of Taiwan fishing boats have been seized by the
Japanese authorities and the boat owners or families of the fishermen
have to pay for their release, seriously undermining the operating
rights of the fishermen, Lin pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lin said the government has yet to address the problem of the
overlapping economic zones.</P>
      <P>To express their anger, he said, a large contingent of fishing
boats will converge in waters between the Tiaoyutais, a tiny group of
islets lying about 75 nautical miles northeast of Keelung, and
Pengchiayu, about 25 nautical miles off Keelung harbor, and he did
not rule out the possibility that the vessels will deliberately go
into the overlapping part of the economic zones to confront the
Japanese patrol boats.</P>
      <P>Coast guard authorities in Suao said that to prevent conflicts
between Taiwan fishermen and Japanese patrol ships, they will send a
ship to escort the protest ships.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) reported
Wednesday that it has sent three ships to handle the situation after
receiving reports that four Taiwanese fishing ships were being chased
away by Japanese patrol boats while operating in waters 60 nautical
miles northeast of Suao that day.</P>
      <P>CGA officials stressed that to protect the rights of Taiwan's
exclusive economic zone and the safety of its fishermen, they send
ships regularly to waters north, east and south of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As long as the fishermen operate within the legal boundaries,
their safety and rights will be fully protected, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AGRICULTURAL BIOTECH PARK IN PINGTUNG TO BE COMPLETED IN MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The construction of an agricultural biotech
industrial park in Pingtung, southern Taiwan, is expected to be
completed in March next year, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that 21 manufacturers have passed the
screening and will enter the park, with three others still being
assessed.</P>
      <P>To cope with the impact on agriculture caused by Taiwan's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2002, the COA, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development and other related
government agencies have been heavily promoting the agricultural
biotech park.</P>
      <P>Agriculture-heavy Pingtung County was chosen as the location of
the park because its agricultural, forestry, fishery and poultry
production sectors have ranked among the top among the 23 cities and
counties in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The park will cover around 233 hectares and the total cost of
construction will be around NT$2.46 billion (US$78.09 million).</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 7 (CNA)
(By C.F. Lee and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An American scholar urged China Tuesday
not to misinterpret the constitutional reforms in Taiwan as
representing a move toward independence.</P>
      <P>Richard C. Bush, senior fellow and director of the Center for
Northeast Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, told a
group of visiting Taiwanese journalists that Beijing's attitude and
reaction to Taiwan's constitutional reforms are important signals
that will indicate China's bottom line.</P>
      <P>Bush said the U.S. government has no reason to oppose
constitutional amendments that are aimed at enhancing government
efficiency in Taiwan and strengthening the country's democratic
development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's National Assembly passed a constitutional amendment
package Tuesday to abolish the assembly to allow for popular
referendums on future constitutional amendments, to reduce the number
of legislative seat from the present 225 to 113 and to adopt a
"single seat, two votes" electoral system starting with the seventh
legislature to be elected in 2007.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said the success of the constitutional
reforms has paved the way for a second phase of reforms, which
officials said will be designed to enhance government efficiency and
will not involve sensitive issues such as changes to the country's
sovereignty, territorial boundaries or official designation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BLUEPRINT FOR 2ND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS DUE IN A WEEK: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office will hammer out a
blueprint for the second phase of constitutional reforms in one week,
Presidential Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The conclusion of a week-long constitutional amendment session by
the ad-hoc National Assembly Tuesday means that the second phase
reforms can kick off immediately, and the Presidential Office has
been working on a blueprint detailing its form and the steps that can
be taken, Yu said.</P>
      <P>As the Constitution represents the fundamentals of a nation's
laws, a new round of constitution revision needs to be conducted
based on a national consensus obtained through comprehensive
participation by people from all walks of life, the top presidential
aide said, adding that this will be a time-consuming task.</P>
      <P>To honor the promise made by President Chen Shui-bian to put
forward a new constitution before he steps down in May 2008, the
constitutional amendment proposals must be approved by the
Legislative Yuan before the end of the first half of 2007 to allow
for a public referendum to decide the fate of the issues, Chen's
aides said.</P>
      <P>The results of various public opinion surveys carried out by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) show that most of the
people in Taiwan favor amending the Constitution, which is widely
viewed as out of date, they claimed, adding that it is why the DPP
feels it necessary to introduce a second phase of constitution
reforms.</P>
      <P>Chen said a day earlier that he hopes to create a "timely,
appropriate and tailor-made" constitution for Taiwan in 2008 and that
he will invite the opposition leaders to join forces in the task.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he had already asked Yu to quickly form a
constitution amending committee under the Presidential Office to
promote public awareness and understanding of the course of Taiwan's
democratization.</P>
      <P>Despite the president's claim that he hopes for across the board
participation by the opposition camp and the whole of society,
various opposition parties have voiced disagreement with his plan.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, head of the Central Policy Committee of the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , said Chen should not seek a new
round of constitutional revision at present, since the latest round
has just ended. The government should instead concentrate on creating
a better livelihood for the people, he said.</P>
      <P>He made it clear that the KMT is opposed to a new phase of
constitutional amendments or any attempts to write a new
constitution.</P>
      <P>Chin Ching-sheng, secretary-general of the second-largest
opposition People First Party (PFP) blamed the DPP and the KMT for
adding new uncertainties to the cross-Taiwan Strait situation and for
putting Taiwan's future at greater risk by endorsing the package of
the just-concluded round of constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>Chin was referring to one of the amendments that grants the right
of referendum to the public to decide constitutional amendments
proposed by the Legislative Yuan. The PFP views it as an approach
that could invite moves toward "de jure" Taiwan independence, a
situation that he claimed will lead to a catastrophe for the country.</P>
      <P>Chien Lin Whei-jun, a former legislator and a National Assembly
member of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
questioned the possibilities of a second round of constitutional
reform that the DPP wants.</P>
      <P>The amendment that requires a three-quarters majority vote by the
Legislative Yuan has actually killed the chances for any new
constitutional revisions in the future, she claimed, pointing out
that under these circumstances, the TSU will continue to advocate a
new constitution for Taiwan through a public referendum that requires
a lower approval threshold.</P>
      <P>The mission-oriented 300-member National Assembly was
automatically dissolved and passed into history Tuesday after
deputies voted 249 to 48 in favor of a package of constitutional
amendments put forward by the Legislative Yuan last August.</P>
      <P>Reducing the number of seats at the Legislative Yuan to 113 from
225, adopting a "one seat, two votes" electoral system and providing
the public with the right of referendum to decide future
constitutional amendment proposals raised by the Legislative Yuan
were among the key issues in the package.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lee Yung-teh officially took the helm of the
Council for Hakka Affairs Wednesday, saying that he will highlight
Hakka culture so that the entire cultural spectrum in Taiwan can be
enriched.</P>
      <P>At a news conference, Lee, who has been acting chairman of the
council for the past three months, said because of the efforts of the
council over the last four years, Hakka culture, which was on the
wane, has rebounded.</P>
      <P>Citing a survey conducted by the council, Lee said the number of
people using the Hakka dialect has fallen by 2 percent every year
because of the "unfavorable political climate."</P>
      <P>In 2002, Lee said, only 11.6 percent of Hakka children under the
age of 13 could speak their mother tongue, but in 2004 the percentage
rose to 13.8 percent, thanks to the establishment of the Council of
Hakka Affairs and the launch of a TV channel that exclusively uses
Hakka.</P>
      <P>People concerned with the preservation of Hakka culture have been
delighted by this change because if Hakkas cannot speak their own
dialect they will lose their unique cultural identity, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee promised to keep promoting Hakka culture by encouraging not
only Hakkas but also other people to learn the Hakka dialect to
enrich the country's diverse culture.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was the council's vice chairman, took the place of
former chairman Lo Wen-chia in March when Lo quit to assembly a

share with the public the first family's delight.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung, who obtained a master's degree in law from the
University of California at Berkeley in May, will be married June 18.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsung stressed that the president has kept a low-profile

Thursday in an online weekly bearing his nickname A-bian that he
hopes his two children can learn to adopt a business-as-usual

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S PLANNED LEGISLATION WOULD FURTHER HURT TIES: MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations across the Taiwan Strait will
suffer yet another setback if China goes ahead with its reported plan
to legislate a so-called "emergency law" in connection with its
anti-secession law targeting Taiwan, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu made the remarks
while meeting with a visiting delegation of state legislatures from
the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region, which covers Delaware, Maryland, New
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Wu said, China will work on its
so-called "emergency law" this year. If the planned legislation is
indeed a complementary act to its anti-secession law enacted in March
of this year, Wu said, the move would definitely deal yet another
severe blow to cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Such an act would also have a grave impact on Taiwan's policy
toward cross-strait ties, Wu added.</P>
      <P>China's anti-secession legislation, which codifies the use of
non-peaceful means against Taiwan, has drawn a strong backlash from
the people of Taiwan and serious concerns in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Wu told his guests that cross-strait relations have remained grim
because China has continued to increase the number of its missiles
and has added new types of submarines.</P>
      <P>"China's accelerated military buildup has not only escalated
cross-strait tensions but has also made Japan feel uneasy," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wu said, China has continued its efforts to squeeze
Taiwan out of the international arena. In May, he recalled that China
used its diplomatic clout to block Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Assembly (WHA) -- the governing body of the World Health
Organization -- as an observer.</P>
      <P>For their part, the leading state assembly members from the
Mid-Atlantic region said they will continue to speak for Taiwan's
cause to join the WHA and other major international organizations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. OFFICIAL CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States looks forward to
seeing the two sides of the Taiwan Strait engage in any for of
dialogue with no political strings or preconditions, a State
Department official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Christopher R. Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs, made the remarks during a hearing on the
"Emergence of China Throughout Asia: Security and Economic
Consequences for the U.S., " organized by the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific.</P>
      <P>"We believe that recently stated positions on both sides of the
Strait incorporate elements of flexibility that could form the basis
of substantive dialogue," Hill said.</P>
      <P>While the recent trips to Beijing by Taiwan's two opposition
leaders -- Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong -- have the potential to be helpful, Hill
said it is crucial that China take the important next step of
reaching out to duly elected representatives on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We encourage any form of cross-Strait dialogue and believe that
the unofficial KMT and PFP visits have the potential to serve as an
important first step in the resumption of a dialogue between Beijing
and Taipei. It is crucial, however, that China take the important
next step of reaching out to elected representatives on Taiwan, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Hill also pointed out that Beijing's strategy on Taiwan is based
on a refusal to renounce the use of force while simultaneously
encouraging economic integration by making itself attractive to
Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>"China also seeks to leverage its economic influence with
countries of the Asia-Pacific region and beyond to generate support
for the PRC's stand on Taiwan. We saw this recently when a number of
countries like Burma, Cambodia and Laos issued statements in March
welcoming China's unhelpful Anti-secession Law," Hill said.</P>
      <P>He further said the longstanding U.S. position, based on its one-
China policy and commitments under the three U.S.-China joint
communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act, has been that cross-Strait
differences must be resolved peacefully through dialogue in a manner
that meets the aspirations of people on both sides of the Strait.</P>
      <P>To that end, Hill said the U.S. government strongly encourages
cross-Strait dialogue of all forms. He added that the anti-secession
legislation adopted by China's National People's Congress was an
unfortunate and unhelpful step that did not contribute to
cross-Strait stability.</P>

      <P>If an ad hoc agency is set up to do this, Lee said political
parties should refrain from interfering with its work by having as
few as possible party representatives in it, and members of the
agency appointed by political parties should not exceed half of the
total.</P>
      <P>As the lawmakers will bear the brunt of the redistricting, the
legislature should not be given the right to approve it, Lee argued.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip William Lai said that legislators can hardly be
expected not to interfere with the process and giving them the right
to approve the redistricting is to give them the power to pull the
strings behind the scenes.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, who is the chief of the party's
Policy Coordination Committee, said his party's idea is negotiable;
the first thing to do is to enact a law governing the organization of
the Central Election Commission to ensure its independence from
political influence.</P>
      <P>But the KMT's proposal to give the Legislative Yuan the final say
in reforming voting districts has won applause from the People First
Party (PFP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , the two other
opposition parties in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Yung-ping of the PFP said the Central Election
Commission has already been controlled by the ruling DPP and could
not be trusted to do redistricting without bias.</P>
      <P>She suggested the Legislative Yuan form a commission to do the
work by itself.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Huang Shih-cho shared Lee's view of having the
Legislative Yuan preside over the redistricting, saying that the
Central Election Commission is sure to gerrymander to give the ruling
party an unfair advantage in elections.</P>
      <P>Only the Legislative Yuan, which keep its fingers on the pulse of
the people, can redraw the constituencies to the public's
satisfaction, Huang claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FISHERMEN MOBILIZE NEARLY 50 VESSELS IN PROTEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Suao fisherman mobilized nearly 50 Taiwan
fishing boats to stage a protest against Japanese patrol vessels in
waters off northeastern Taiwan Thursday.</P>
      <P>The fishermen mobilized fishing boats operating off Suao,
northeastern Taiwan at 4 a.m. to stage the protest.</P>
      <P>White banners that read "Are fishermen second-rate citizens? "
"Encroachment on our traditional fishing grounds! " and "Attach
importance to the rights of fishermen!" were tied on the boats.</P>
      <P>To avoid possible confrontation between the fishing boats and
Japanese patrol boats, the Coast Guard Administration sent seven
ships, led by a 917-ton vessel, to escort the Taiwan fishing boats.</P>
      <P>The fishermen wanted to confront Japanese patrol ships, which are
often in the area to chase them away, so as to arouse international
attention, but no patrol ships showed up.</P>
      <P>Japan only sent several reconnaissance planes to monitor the
situation, and the protest ended peacefully at 6:30 a.m.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's economic zone overlaps that of Japan's, the Ministry
of the Interior at the end of 2003 drew a provisional line within the 
Republic of China's 200-mile exclusive economic zone at the mid-point
between the overlapping zones.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fishermen generally stay within this boundary, but
Japanese patrol boats have chased away Taiwan fishing boats several
times recently, leading the fishermen to complain that their legal
fishing grounds are being encroached upon.</P>
      <P>In addition, a total of 13 Suao fishing boats have been seized by
Japan while operating in Taiwan's economic zone since 2001, and the
boat owners or families of the fishermen have had to pay for their
release.</P>
      <P>Suao fishery official Lin Kuang-hui noted that the fishermen
staged the "spontaneous" protest to vent their long-term anger and
misgivings.</P>
      <P>Lin said the fishermen hope that the large-scale protest will
drive home their call that the government step up protection of
fishermen that stay within the legal boundaries, and that the
government embark on negotiations with Japan on the problem of
overlapping economic zones.</P>
      <P>Another fishery official, Chen Chien-chung, said overlapping
economic zones and fishing rights being encroached upon have been
long-term problems, and if the government is unable to solve them,
the fishermen could stage an even bigger protest next time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ASKS OLYMPIC COMMITTEE TO CORRECT NAME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  9 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan asked the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) on Thursday to correct the mistaken designation of
Taiwan as "Taiwan, Province of China" appearing on an IOC Web page.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee President Huang Ta-chou said
that his committee protested to the IOC and asked for a correction as
soon as it discovered the error and that the IOC has promised to
change the name to "Chinese Taipei" -- the one Taiwan registered with
the IOC -- as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Huang said he believes the matter to be a simple technical error
that is not related to politics.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu,
this is not the first time that the IOC has made similar errors.</P>
      <P>The error in question appears in the country list of the on-line
registration form for the 117th IOC session, which is set for July
6-9 in Singapore.</P>
      <P>In Geneva, an IOC spokeswoman, Sandrine Chappuis, told the CNA
that the error is the result of the IOC using the standard country
names established by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO).</P>
      <P>Chappuis stressed this is a purely technical problem and does not
represent any changes in the IOC's decision or position.</P>
      <P>She said that she understands this is a very sensitive issue for
Taiwan and that the IOC will deal with the matter, but added that it
is still uncertain when the correction will be made as most IOC
personnel are now busy preparing for the Singapore session.</P>
      <P>The ISO country name codes are established according to the
United Nations' format. Despite its opposition, Taiwan, which is not
a member of the United Nations or ISO, can do nothing about being
called "a province of China."</P>

relations now 30 years

The Philippines and China will commemorate today
the 30th anniversary of their diplomatic relations,
vowing to further strengthen their ties for the next
20 years towards a "golden age of partnership."

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: 'Jueteng' bagwoman
says she paid off Arroyo in-law 

THE FIRST direct statement implicating President
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's family in the raging illegal
gambling controversy emerged yesterday in a television
news report when a confessed "bag lady" claimed she
collected P1 million a month for the Chief Executive's
son and brother-in-law.

The Philippine Star: Bagwoman tags Mikey, Iggy

Presidential relatives implicated in the jueteng

Arroyo of Negros Occidental, the President's

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush said
Wednesday he believes that time will heal the political dispute
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"My attitude is that time will heal this issue. And therefore
we're trying to make sure that neither side provokes the other
through unilateral action, " Bush said in an interview with Fox News
TV Channel.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the United States would uphold its promise to
defend Taiwan if the island were ever invaded, Bush said: "Yes, we
do. It's called the Taiwan Relations Act."</P>
      <P>Bush explained that the the U.S. stance is that it supports a
"one China" policy based on the three Washington-Beijing communiques.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Bush said, the United States adheres to the Taiwan
Relations Act, which means it is against either side of the Taiwan
Strait unilaterally changing the status quo.</P>
      <P>"In other words, neither side will make a decision that steps
outside the bounds of that statement I just made to you. If China
were to invade unilaterally, we would rise up in the spirit of Taiwan
Relations Act. If Taiwan were to declare independence, it would be a
unilateral decision that would then change the U.S. equation, " Bush
added.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's
recent criticism of China's rapid military buildup despite not facing
any threats in the region, Bush said the U.S.-China relationship is a
complex one.</P>
      <P>"It is complex because we deal with each other on a variety of
fronts. One front, of course, is our defense posture," Bush said.</P>
      <P>When asked whether he trusts China, Bush said: "So far, I do.
We'll see."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The largest opposition party, the Kuomintang
(KMT) , hopes to work closely with its ally the People First Party
(PFP) to set up a mechanism to produce candidates agreed upon between
them to run in the year-end city and county elections, a KMT official
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liao Feng-teh, director of the KMT's Organization and Development
Committee, made the remarks one day after PFP Secretary-General Chin
Chin-sheng said that consultations between the two parties on
cooperation in the year-end elections is scheduled to start after
June 22, when both parties will have decided upon their nominees.</P>
      <P>The PFP is suggesting that a "coalition government" be created as
a way of cooperation, and that the mechanism of producing candidates
will "be mainly based on consultations and public opinion polls as
complementary measures, " Chin said. The PFP also wants to have a
cooperative agreement signed between the two parties, he added.</P>
      <P>Liao noted that the KMT has prepared its own integration
mechanism for the two parties, and will consider whether to conduct
public and party opinion polls or consult opinion leaders. The top
leaders of the two parties will decide on this matter.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the PFP held a press conference Thursday to drum up
support for the party's first group of seven nominees for the city
and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>Most of the seven nominees -- Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung for
Keelung mayor, Legislator Sun Ta-chien for Taoyung County magistrate,
Shen Chi-hui for Taichung mayor, former Legislator Hsieh Chang-chieh
for Changhua County magistrate, Legislator Chen Chih-ping for Nantou
County magistrate, incumbent Lienchiang County Magistrate Chen
Hsueh-sheng and PFP Police Center Deputy Director Lee Yun-chieh for
Chiayi mayor -- said a victory of the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
of the KMT and the PFP is the goal.</P>
      <P>But they also pointed out that "the KMT is not equal to the
'pan-blue alliance, '" and that the two parties should consult to
produce a "fair and transparent" mechanism in finalizing only one
"pan-blue" candidate for each city and county.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA CLARIFIES CIECA INVITATIONS OF U. S. LAWMAKERS TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The visits of U. S. Congressmen to Taiwan at
the invitation of the Chinese International Economic Cooperation
Association (CIECA) were aimed at booting two-way trade ties,
activities that have nothing to do with political lobbying, Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lu's comments came after the Washington-based Capitol Update, a
weekly review of the newest legislative and regulatory news, reported
in an edition published earlier the same day that from 2000 to 2004,
a total of 34 U. S. Congressmen were treated by two Taiwan-based
trade organizations -- the CIECA and the Chinese National Association
of Industry and Commerce (CNAIC) -- to trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the weekly, the two trade organizations that
maintain good relations with the Taiwan government failed to abide by
the U. S. law that stipulates that lobbying groups must register with
the U. S. Congress and the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the CIECA is a non-profit group engaged
exclusively in strengthening Taiwan's economic links with the rest of
the world, Lu said that its invitations to U. S. lawmakers to visit
Taiwan were not in violation of the law either in Taiwan or in the
United States as the visits were not involved with any lobbying or
political activities.</P>
      <P>Lu further dismissed the notion that it was not the CIECA that
had issued the invitations. The CIECA was called the CNAIC prior to
2002, he elaborated.</P>

the implementation of a "single seat, two votes" electoral system in
Taiwan, an MOI official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-chi, deputy director of the MOI's Department of Civil
Affairs, said during a seminar hosted by opposition Kuomintang
Legislator Lai Shyh-bao that the ministry plans to submit its draft
revisions to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law to the
Cabinet in July and send the draft to the Legislative Yuan for review
in the next legislative session set to start in September.</P>
      <P>The National Assembly passed on Tuesday a constitutional
amendment package under which the number of legislative seats will be
reduced to 113 and a "single seat, two votes" system will be adopted
starting with the next legislature to be elected in 2007.</P>
      <P>While 73 seats will be elected from regional districts, there
will be six seats for aboriginal representatives and 34 seats for
at-large and overseas expatriate representatives.</P>
      <P>The regional seats will be distributed among special
municipalities, counties and cities according to their populations,
with each locality enjoying at least one seat and one legislator
elected from each district. The at-large and overseas expatriate
seats will be allocated to political parties that win at least 5
percent of the votes, according to the proportion of votes they
garner.</P>
      <P>Yu Ming-hsien, an official at the Central Election Commission
(CEC) , said the CEC will maintain the integrity of administrative
regions while re-demarcating the constituencies in line with the new
electoral system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai proposed that a CEC organic law be enacted to
ensure the CEC's impartiality in conducting constituency
re-demarcation.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the members of CEC should be appointed by
proportional representation, and a constituency demarcation review
committee should be set up under the CEC to protect its independence
and objectivity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN URGED TO NEGOTIATE WITH TAIWAN ON OVERLAPPING ECONOMIC ZONES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Thursday urged Japan to negotiate with Taiwan as soon as possible on
the problem of overlapping economic zones of the two countries.</P>
      <P>Lin Song-huann, director of MOFA's Department of East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, made the remarks after nearly 50 Taiwan fishing
boats converged in waters between the Tiaoyutais, a tiny group of
islets lying about 75 nautical miles northeast of Keelung, and
Pengchiayu, about 25 nautical miles off Keelung harbor earlier in the
day to protest against Japanese patrol ships, which are often in the
area to chase them away.</P>
      <P>The fishermen wanted to confront Japanese patrol boats, but the
protest ended peacefully as no patrol boats showed up, only several
Japanese reconnaissance planes were monitoring the situation.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that at issue was the formulation of a law regarding
its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf by Japan in 1996,
which includes Taiwan and Matsu into its 200-mile economic zone.</P>
      <P>Because of the unreasonable demarcation, both countries started
negotiations in 1996.</P>
      <P>Both sides have conducted 14 rounds of fishery negotiations as of
the end of last year, but couldn't reach consensus, Lin said. He
urged Japan to attach importance to the long-term friendship between
the two countries and deal with the problem pragmatically.</P>
      <P>The government has asked its representative office in Japan to
convey the fishermen's anger and exasperation, hoping that Japan
could address the issue squarely and conduct the 15th round of
negotiations with Taiwan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>He said the government can understand the feelings of the
fishermen, but he urged rationality, saying that the issue involves
the sovereignty and laws of the two countries, and protesting will
not solve the problem.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the fishermen will provide related
information of being unfairly treated, such as where their ships were
being chased away and seized, so as to be used in future negotiations
with Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC ZONE ISSUE SHOULD BE SOLVED DIPLOMATICALLY: CGA HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Controversial economic zone issue should be
solved diplomatically and international fishing disputes should be
settled via fishery talks, Syu Huei-you, minister of the Coast Guard
Administration (CGA), said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Syu reiterated that the CGA is resolutely firm in protecting the
safety and interests of the country's fishermen, particularly in
light of the fact that four Taiwanese fishing boats were driven away
by Japanese patrol boats while operating in waters 43 nautical miles
northeastern of Keelung Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Syu stressed that while doing its best to safeguard fishermen's
safety and rights when Taiwanese fishing boats are operating within
the Republic of China territorial waters, the CGA believes firmly
that controversies arising from disputed economic zones, such as the
area in the East China Sea and south of Okinawa, where China, Taiwan
and Japan all claim sovereignty, should be redressed via diplomatic
means or through negotiations.</P>
      <P>According to CGA authorities, another nine Taiwanese fishing
boats were facing off against Japanese patrol boats in the area
around 7 p.m. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's incidents -- only the latest two of many --
prompted more than 40 fishing boats from Suao, northeastern Taiwan,
to sail out in concert Thursday to the area to stage a protest
against the Japanese patrol ships' bullying.</P>
      <P>To avoid possible confrontation between the fishing boats and
Japanese patrol ships, the CGA dispatched seven ships, led by a
917-ton vessel, to escort the Taiwan fishing boats.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's economic zone overlaps that of Japan's, the Ministry
of the Interior at the end of 2003 drew a provisional line within the
ROC's 200-mile exclusive economic zone at the mid-point between the
overlapping zones.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fishermen generally stay within this boundary, but
Japanese patrol boats have driven away Taiwan fishing boats several
times recently, leading the fishermen to complain that their legal
fishing grounds are being encroached upon.</P>
      <P>A total of 13 Suao fishing boats have reportedly been seized by
Japan while operating in Taiwan's economic zone since 2001, and the
boat owners or families of the fishermen have had to pay for their
release.</P>
      <P>A Suao Fishermen's Association official said Thursday that
overlapping economic zones and fishing rights being encroached upon
have been long-term problems, and if the government is unable to
solve them, the fishermen could stage an even bigger protest next
time.</P>

(By Y. F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has requested Japan to speed
up bilateral talks with Taiwan to seek a resolution to fishery
disputes triggered by an overlap of the exclusive economic zones of
both countries, Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh proposed that both countries refrain from taking expulsion
actions against fishing boats from the other side before the
negotiations come to any conclusions.</P>
      <P>The premier was responding to a conflict breaking out a day
earlier off Taiwan's northeast coast between Taiwanese fishing boats
and the Japanese coast guard following an expulsion by the Japanese
side.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that the problem exists because both Taiwan and
Japan claim that their exclusive economic zones extend 200 nautical
miles out from their coasts, which overlap at some points.</P>
      <P>The premier said the process of negotiations with Japan involves
much difficulty because Taiwan maintains no diplomatic relations with
Japan, but he promised that the government will make an all-out
effort to protect the country's sovereignty and the rights of
Taiwanese fishermen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AND U.S. WILL TEAM UP TO PROBE ECSTASY AND THE BRAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will cooperate with Taiwan
in studying whether the use of ecstasy, also known as MDMA, damages
the brain, a Department of Health (DOH) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Under the cooperative program, the U.S. government will provide
US$300,000 over two years for the DOH's National Bureau of
Controlled Drugs (NBCD) and the Tri-Service General Hospital to study
the impact of MDMA on the human brain.</P>
      <P>NBCD Director Lee Chih-heng said the cooperative research program
has just begun. Under the program, researchers will collect cases
involving people who have used MDMA more than five times. Fifty MDMA
users in the study will receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
examinations so that researchers can look into whether their brain
cells have undergone any changes after using the drug.</P>
      <P>Barry Hoffer, director of the U.S. National Institute on Drug
Abuse (NIDA) , who is currently in Taipei to attend an international
conference on neural transplantation and regeneration, said the NIDA
has initiated the cooperative program mainly because both Taiwan and
the United States face MDMA abuse problems.</P>
      <P>As the United States is a multiracial country, Hoffer said,
hereditary factors may hinder the study of MDMA's possible damage to
the brain. In comparison, he said, Taiwan people's genetic
backgrounds are believed to be simpler and thus helpful to the study.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, Lee said some local physicians have reported cases
involving MDMA users suffering from strokes or dementia. However, he
said, those reports lacked MRI support. Moreover, he said, local
addicts usually like to use a mix of ecstasy and other drugs, making
it hard for researchers to judge whether their symptoms or mind
disorders were caused purely by MDMA.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lee said the ongoing Taiwan-U.S.
cooperative research program will require looking into the addicts'
drug abuse history.</P>

      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i said Thursday that he
is cautiously optimistic about Taiwan reaching an economic growth of
more than 4 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while commenting on the current economic
situation and strategies when he attended a congress of the Importers
and Exporters Association of Taipei.</P>
      <P>To achieve this goal, he said that government needs to use a
two-pronged approach.</P>
      <P>The first is to relax regulations and he thinks that it is most
helpful to economic growth if the spending of the private sector can
grow.</P>
      <P>The second is to expand government spending, Wu said, adding that
the budget for the 10 New Major Construction Projects only passed the
Legislative Yuan last month, although the Executive Yuan proposed it
last year and is hoping to use it this year.</P>
      <P>Wu said that businesses should pressure legislators so that
urgent bills could be passed soon.</P>
      <P>He said world economic growth should reach over 3 percent this
year, compared with 4 percent last year.</P>
      <P>Though the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics recently adjusted Taiwan's economic growth downward to
3.6 percent, Wu said Taiwan's economy has been quite resilient, and
it could rebound quickly.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government is usually conservative in its
predictions, citing the figures by such institutions as the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund which have predicted that
Taiwan will have no problem in reaching an economic growth of 4
percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP SETS UP CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ASSESSMENT TASK FORCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) decided Thursday to set up a constitutional amendment
assessment unit in its weekly Central Standing Committee (CSC)
meeting to compliment President Chen Shui-bian's call for a second
round of amendments.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang will serve as convener of the
15-member task force, with the 14 others coming from the government,
the party and representatives from the academic sector, such as
Presidential Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, lawmakers Trong Chai and
Chao Yung-ching and various scholars.</P>
      <P>Su hailed the latest round of constitutional amendments that
concluded Tuesday and expressed his belief that the constitutional
changes will help Taiwan develop into a sound country, where politics
can become more even-handed over the long term.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsan, director of the DPP's culture and communications
department, said earlier the same day that the party will begin to
craft a blueprint for the second phase of constitutional reforms
after an assessment panel has been set up.</P>
      <P>The DPP will invite representatives from a wide spectrum to take
part in the panel to forge a consensus based on popular support,
Cheng said, adding that the panel may consider setting a timetable
for the second round of constitutional reforms and include certain
key amendment proposals in the blueprint.</P>
      <P>In response to the opposition parties' cold shoulder to the DPP's
plan to conduct a second round of constitutional revisions, DPP
Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang claimed that a second phase of
constitutional reforms will not hobble the government's efforts to
improve Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Working out a "tailor-made, timely and appropriate" constitution
for Taiwan will help sharpen the country's competitiveness and the
opposition parties should fully throw their support behind the DPP
instead of standing in the way, Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the next round of constitutional amendments
will focus on revisions regarding the governmental system and the
fate of the now vestigial Taiwan Provincial Government, among other
issues.</P>
      <P>The latest round of a weeklong constitutional revisions session
ended Tuesday, with ad hoc National Assembly deputies voting 249 to
48 in favor of a package of amendments approved by the Legislative
Yuan last August.</P>
      <P>While the ruling DPP and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
fully endorsed the amendments contained in the package, smaller
parties such as the People First Party and the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) said that it would spell disaster for Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>The PFP and TSU will face even more aggressive competition in
future elections, as the amendments will allow for the adoption of a
"one seat, two votes" electoral system in newly demarcated but
smaller constituencies and with the seats at the next legislature to
be cut by nearly half to 113 from 225 when it opens in early 2008.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT is widely assumed to benefit the most from the
new electoral system, the party has made it clear that it would be a
big mistake for the DPP to initiate a new round of constitutional
reforms at a time when the people in Taiwan are looking forward to
a better livelihood.</P>
      <P>KMT officials urged the ruling party to focus its energy on
issues of major public concern, such as improving the economy and
social order, and accused it of intending to shift public attention
from its inability to rule the country by a new wave of political
moves.</P>

A U.S. Justice Department decision to seek US$10 billion for a
stop-smoking program in its suit against the country's leading
tobacco companies, instead of the US$130 billion suggested by one of
its expert witnesses, set off a firestorm on Wednesday. Several

motivated decision, as did public health groups. The payments are
intended to finance a stop-smoking program that a government witness

Wall Street Journal: Side Effects, In Treating U.S. After Bubble,
Fed Helped Create New Threats.

By many yardsticks, the Federal Reserve's response to the
bursting of the stock and tech- spending bubbles in 2000 has been a
remarkable success. The 2001 recession was mild and economic growth
since has been brisk. Employment is up and inflation remains within
the Fed's hallowed zone of price stability. But five years after the
s tock market's peak, the economy faces other threatening imbalances:
a potential housing bubble, rock-bottom personal saving rates and a
gargantuan trade deficit. And the Fed's post-bubble prescription
bears some responsibility for all three. By slashing short-term
interest rates to 45-year lows, the Fed encouraged Americans to
borrow more, gave them little reward for saving and helped ignite a
surge in housing prices. President Bush and Co ngress joined in with
steep tax cuts that boosted household purchasing power. All that
spending contributed to a growing U.S. economy, a steady increase in
imports and -- given that Americans are so eager to borrow and
foreigners so eager to lend -- a mountain of foreign debt.</TEXT>

      <P>The U.S. government is resolute in its
desire to help Taiwan beef up its self-defense capabilities but
Washington is also concerned as to whether Taiwan is determined to
protecting itself militarily, an American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>David J. Keegan, deputy director of the Taipei office of the AIT,
the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic relations, expressed U.S. concerns over the fate of an
arms procurement budget bill that has been stuck in Taiwan's
opposition-controlled legislature for two legislative sessions.</P>
      <P>Keegan made the remarks during a lunch with two legislators from
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) at the official
residence of Douglas Paal, director of the AIT's Taipei office.</P>
      <P>According to Shen Fa-hui, one of the legislators who attended the
luncheon, Keegan expressed serious concern over Taiwan lawmakers'
attitudes toward the arms procurement bill, which involves the
purchase of important weapons systems including eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>Keegan, however, did not say anything about the U.S. bottom line
on the deadline for these orders, according to Shen.</P>
      <P>On May 24, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said at the
Legislative Yuan that the window of opportunity is closing for Taiwan
to purchase a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the
United States, claiming that the U.S. "has given Taiwan till the end

      <P>Keegan also said that the U.S. will pay close attention on how

Assembly Tuesday will impact the outcome of the year-end mayoral and
county chief elections.</P>
      <P>Paal was absent from the luncheon because he had another

      <P>Paal extended an invitation at the end of May to the leaders and

      <P>Two Taiwan-based groups clarified their role
Thursday in a report by a Washington-based weekly alleging that they
treated over 30 U. S. lawmakers to visit Taiwan over the past four
years and said there was nothing illegal in the matter.</P>
      <P>Lin Tien-kuei, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce (CNAIC), said that his group has
nothing to do with the story published by the Capitol Update that
same day and added that it has never invited any U.S. lawmaker to
Taiwan since 2002, when incumbent chairman Huang Mao-hsiung assumed
the post.</P>
      <P>Capitol Update reported that a total of 34 U. S. congressmen,
including some who have been involved in political contribution
scandals, were invited to Taiwan from 2000 to 2004 by two trade
groups that maintain good relations with the Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>The report alleged that spending on the trips totaled more than
US$230,000 and that the congressmen who accepted the invitations
might have violated U. S. law, as the two Taiwan groups failed to
register with the U. S. Congress and the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the non-profit Chinese International
Economic Cooperation Association (CIECA) , a splinter group of the
CNAIC, said that the CIECA is not a political lobbying body and
claimed that it has never done any political lobbying in the United
States.</P>
      <P>According to CIECA Deputy Secretary-General Lin Chi-sung, the
group invited some U. S. congressmen to visit Taiwan to help them
better understand Taiwan's democratic and economic development.
Private sector exchanges are very important in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties between the two countries, he added.</P>
      <P>As to the claim that the U. S. congressmen might have broken
U. S. law if they did not report their Taiwan trips to Congress prior
to departure, Lin said that the CIECA is unaware of U. S. legal
restrictions.</P>
      <P>The CIECA was established in 2000 to take charge of CNAIC's
international exchange affairs, Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LODGES PROTEST WITH JAPAN OVER FISHING DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June  9 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's deputy representative to Japan
lodged a formal protest with the Japanese Interchange Association
(JIA) Thursday over a fishing dispute.</P>
      <P>Chen Hung-chi, deputy head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Japan, presented the protest letter to the JIA, a
quasi-official organization authorized to handle exchanges with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>A senior JIA official accepted the petition and promised to relay
it to the relevant Japanese authorities.</P>
      <P>Chen told the official that four ROC fishing vessels were
dispersed by Japanese patrol ships Wednesday while they were
operating in the overlapping area of the two countries' 200-mile
exclusive economic zones.</P>
      <P>"We solemnly protest such an act, " Chen said, adding that Japan
should exercise self-restraint toward Taiwan fishermen's operations
in disputed waters.</P>
      <P>He also urged Japan to hold a new round of bilateral fishery
talks as soon as possible to resolve longstanding disputes over
fishing operations in the overlapping economic zones.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, about 60 Taiwanese trawlers converged in waters
about 80 nautical miles east of northern Taiwan, near a number of
small, uninhabited islands known as the Tiaoyutais, which are claimed
by Taiwan, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>Fish abound in the waters surround the Tiaoyutais and Japan often
impounds Taiwanese fishing vessels that enter the waters, fining
their owners. The absence of formal diplomatic ties has made it
difficult to resolve the disputes.</P>

via Hong Kong Thursday to witness the christening of a Taiwan bulk
carrier built by the Taipei-based Chinese Maritime Transport (CMT).</P>
      <P>Lien, accompanied by her sons and daughters, kept a low-profile

from the Shanghai city government and public security authorities.</P>
      <P>She has been invited to co-preside at the christening ceremony
slated for Friday for the "China Peace, " which was commissioned by
the CMT and built at the Waigaoqiao Shipyard in Pudong, Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The 75,000-ton "China Peace" is a Cape-sized bulk carrier
designed to carry coal, iron ore, or wheat across oceans, according
to a CMT spokesman.</P>
      <P>Cape-sized is a term that denotes a vessel that is too large to
navigate the Panama or Suez canals and must therefore sail around
Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, respectively.</P>
      <P>Lien's last trip to China was April 26-May 3 when she accompanied
her husband on a visit to Nanjing, Beijing, Xian and Shanghai. During
that visit, the KMT chairman met with Chinese President Hu Jintao,
marking the first meeting between the leaders of the KMT and the
Communist Party of China (CPC) since the KMT fled China after being
defeated by the CPC in 1949. Hu doubles as CPC general secretary.</P>

billion in the first five months of this year, up 10.5 percent from
the previous year's level, according to customs statistics released
Thursday by the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>During the January-May period, the tallies show, Taiwan exported
goods worth US$74.81 billion and imported goods worth US$74.26
billion, up 7.6 percent and 13.5 percent over the figures recorded a
year ago, respectively, leaving a trade surplus of US$550 million in
Taiwan's favor.</P>
      <P>In May alone, foreign trade increased by 7.5 percent year-on-year
to US$32.46 billion, of which exports totaled US$16.32 billion and
imports accounted for US$16.14 billion, leaving a trade surplus of
US$180 million in the country's favor.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Foreign Trade officials said the foreign trade surplus
has been dwindling since the beginning of this year due to the sharp
increase of oil prices and the slowdown of global economic growth.</P>
      <P>They said, however, that economic performance remained strong in
light of export orders received in May, worth US$20.81 billion.</P>
      <P>Also, they went on, export reliance on China has been alleviated
as exports to China and Hong Kong accounted for 36.3 percent of the
total in May, down 1.6 percentage points from the previous year's
level.</P>
      <P>The officials said the government will continue to help exporters

      <P>The overall output from Taiwan's integrated
circuit (IC) manufacturing industry totaled NT$235.8 billion (US$7.6
billion) in the first quarter of this year, the Taiwan Semiconductor
Industry Association (TSIA) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The NT$235.8 billion figure represented a decline of 3 percent

decline of 16.4 percent from Q4 of 2004, TSIA officials said.</P>

first-quarter production of NT$57.5 billion and NT$127.7 billion,

      <P>The government's policy toward relations
across the Taiwan Strait is to maintain the peaceful status quo and
resolve any cross-strait dispute by no other than peaceful means, the
Presidential Office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office issued the statement after U.S. President

Taiwan nor China "provokes the other through unilateral action" but

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is grateful for U.S.
President George W. Bush's reaffirming his commitment to helping
defend Taiwan if the country is invaded, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
spokesman Michel Lu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lu's remarks came after Bush said in an interview with Fox News
TV Channel Wednesday that the United States adheres to the Taiwan
Relations Act, which means it is against either side of the Taiwan
Strait unilaterally changing the status quo.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the United States would uphold its promise to
defend Taiwan if the island were to suffer an invasion, Bush said:
"Yes, we [would]. It's called the Taiwan Relations Act."</P>
      <P>Responding to Bush's statement, Lu said Taiwan has no intention
of altering the Taiwan Strait status quo. On the contrary, he said,
Taiwan has been a staunch supporter and defender of the peaceful
status quo in the region.</P>
      <P>Lu said President Chen Shui-bian has on numerous occasions
announced that Taiwan will continue to uphold the universal values of
peace, freedom and democracy and is willing to dialogue with China
under the principles of "peace, democracy and parity."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said the government is
hopeful that Bush's reaffirmation of the U.S. commitment to help
defend Taiwan in the event of an invasion could help deter any
attempt to use "non-peaceful means" to alter the Taiwan Strait status
quo.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Bush's remarks reflect closer Taiwan-U.S. ties, Cho
said that since China enacted its anti-secession law in March,
codifying the use of "non-peaceful means" against the nation,
Taiwan-U.S. ties have "become an important integral part of
international relations."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS OF 2ND ROUND OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  9  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed
confidence Thursday in getting success in the second round of
constitutional reforms.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with a group of ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislators at the Taipei Guest House, Chen said the second
round of reforms is aimed at increasing the government's efficiency,
which he said is part of the government's efforts to improve the
economy, according to William Lai, DPP legislative caucus whip, who
was present in the meeting.</P>
      <P>Lai quoted Chen as saying that the constitutional reforms do not
contradict the opposition camp demand that the government should
focus its efforts on improving the economy.</P>
      <P>Many issues related to the people's livelihood will be involved
in the second phase of revisions, particularly issues with regard to
the interests of laborers, youth, women and aboriginal people, Chen
went on.</P>
      <P>The reforms will be successful because they will forge a national
consensus, the president claimed while rebutting concerns about a
high threshold imposed by the now-defunct National Assembly for
future constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>According to the revised Constitution, future constitutional
amendments will require a three-quarters majority vote by the
Legislative Yuan and be endorsed by a referendum.</P>
      <P>Chen announced Tuesday the start of the second phase of
constitutional reforms shortly after the National Assembly approved a
package of constitutional amendments adopted by the Legislative Yuan
last August.</P>
      <P>Referring to cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Chen said it is clear
Taiwan should take its own path, given that Beijing still insists on
its "one China" principle after Lien Chan, chairman of the main
opposition Kuomintang, and James Soong, chairman of the People First
Party, visited China last month and claimed there are different
interpretations of "one China" by the two sides of the strait -- the
so-called "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>"There is no consensus," Chen reiterated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LEADERS' VISITS TO U.S. CONDUCIVE TO CROSS-STRAIT TIES: PFP</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visits to the United States by Taiwan's
democratically elected leaders would be conducive to the development
of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, an opposition People First Party
(PFP) whip said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-pin, convener of the PFP caucus at the Legislative
Yuan, made the comments when expressing welcome to the passage by the
International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives Thursday of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act
for 2006 and 2007 (H.R. 2601) with an amendment (Section 806) in
support of high-level visits to the United States by Taiwan's elected
leaders.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan leaders being allowed to make official
visits to the United States will also help the Taiwan people grasp
their leaders' ideas and the government's policy on cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>"At least the president wouldn't dare lie to the U.S. president
during such a visit, and what he would say would count, even if he
lies to the people and lawmakers back home," Chen said mockingly.</P>
      <P>Chen added that since the United States is committed to
protecting Taiwan based on its Taiwan Relations Act, it is essential
and imperative for the president of the Republic of China on Taiwan
to visit the United States.</P>
      <P>The amendment that the International Relations Committee passed
on Thursday was submitted by the House International Relations
Subcommittee on Africa, Global Human Rights and International
Operations on May 26 this year.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment says that "it is in the national interests
of the United States to communicate directly with democratically
elected and appointed officials of Taiwan, including the president of
Taiwan, the vice president of Taiwan, the foreign minister of Taiwan,
and the defense minister of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"The Department of State should, in accordance with Public Law
103-416, admit such high level officials of Taiwan to the United
States to discuss issues of mutual concern with the U.S. officials, "
the amendment further says.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LU CALLS FOR CROSS-PACIFIC GROUPING TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY, PROSPERITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Friday that
the development of a regional, cross-Pacific organization to promote
the values of democracy, peace and prosperity is not only an urgent
present matter, it is also important in terms of helping secure
long-term stability in the world.</P>
      <P>Addressing via teleconference the Asia-Pacific Regional Meeting
of the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) held in Tokyo Friday, Lu, the
founder of the union and chair of its International Preparatory
Committee, said that although she was not able to attend the meeting
in person, she still feels privileged to join the meeting via
teleconference and meet so many distinguished leaders from countries
throughout the Asia-Pacific region gathered in Tokyo to build a
better future for the world.</P>
      <P>Quoting a line from Charles Dickson's "The Tale of Two Cities, "
namely "it was the best of times; it was the worst of times," Lu said
the 21st century is certainly "a century of paradox, a time marked by
incredible peace and serious conflict, where contentions and
compromises coexist."</P>
      <P>"It is a time of hope and a time of crisis. It is also a time
when we must soberly examine the past while we plan our future course
with enthusiasm and optimism," she said.</P>
      <P>While the dual forces of globalization and the information
revolution have resulted in much prosperity and economic success,
these forces have also deepened the economic divide between the North
and the South, Lu continued.</P>
      <P>She said that the integration of the East and the West is not
only a strategic alliance, but also a fusion of cultures and values
-- resulting in a new "Blue Civilization focused on the development
of the ocean as well as the land."</P>
      <P>The integration of the North and the South is not just an
economic partnership, but also an effort to promote prosperity by
sharing development experiences among the members and to foster
understanding through the inclusion of South Pacific cultures in the
formation of the "Blue Civilization," Lu noted.</P>
      <P>Lu said that globalization and the information revolution have
also posed new challenges for the Pacific Rim area, prompting her to
initiate the concept of a Democratic Pacific Union, which started in
2001 with the preparatory meeting of a Democratic Pacific Assembly.</P>
      <P>The goal of the DPU is to gather the democracies around the
Pacific Rim region to promote democracy, ensure peace and spread
prosperity throughout the Pacific Rim region, she added.</P>
      <P>Lu stressed that in the DPU Asia-Pacific Regional Meeting, the
topics of civilization and technology are especially important. "This
region contains a diverse group of civilizations that are both
ancient and modern. Yet it is also a region that has the most
communist states in the world. The region has the fastest growing
economy in the world today, primarily driven by technological
progress and world-renowned information technology industries, " she
said.</P>
      <P>"Yet it is also a region that faces old and new threats, ranging
from the remnants of conflicts during the Cold War to the rise of
terrorist groups."</P>
      <P>"Through the discussion and presentation today, I hope that the
participating countries will have a better understanding of each
other as well as the issues that face the Asia Pacific community, "
she added.</P>
      <P>Lu said that in March of this year, the DPU held its first
regional meeting in the Americas, where delegates from 12 countries
gathered in Guatemala to discuss the issues of development. Delegates
from Taiwan shared Taiwan's economic, technological and agricultural
development experiences with the participants from the Americas. The
panel sessions, titled "The Taiwan Experience," received overwhelming
responses from those participating. The success of the first regional
meeting also laid a solid foundation for the Asia-Pacific Regional
Meeting today, she said.</P>
      <P>Lu also noted that the DPU International Preparatory Committee
and the International Secretariat have started some initial projects
for the DPU operations, including the Taiwan Scholarship and a
Visiting Fellowship Program.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Scholarship program is aimed at developing future
leaders by promoting academic exchanges between Taiwan and other
members of the DPU. Recipients of the scholarship are given three
years to study in Taiwan and to learn about the Taiwan economic
development and democratization experiences.</P>
      <P>The Visiting Fellowship Program provides prominent leaders in the
political, academic, non-profit and private sectors a chance to visit
Taiwan. It is designed to strengthen the ties among DPU members and
to provide a platform for professional exchanges, she noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to these two programs, she said, the DPU
International Secretariat is also planning three institutes: the
Institute for Democracy, the Institute for Peace, and the Institute
for Prosperity; and three centers: the Center for Women's
Development, the Center for Marine Development, and the Center for
Disaster Prevention; as well as a Pacific Internet University.</P>
      <P>More than 100 distinguished leaders from countries around the
Asia-Pacific region participated in Friday's meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS URGE JAPAN TO HOLD TALKS WITH TAIWAN ON FISHING RIGHTS ASAP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two legislators of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Friday urged Japan to conduct talks with
Taiwan over fishing rights in the disputed overlapping economic zones
as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislators Wang Tuoh and Hsu Kuo-yung made the appeal one
day after Taiwan fishermen mobilized nearly 50 fishing vessels to
stage a protest in waters off northeastern Taiwan against Japanese
patrol boats, which are often in the area to chase them away.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the fishermen's move shows that they can no longer
tolerate "the pirate acts of the Japanese patrol boats" and that they
have become desperate regarding the government's lack of resolve to
protect them.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he has asked the Fisheries Administration under
the Council of Agriculture to resort to confrontation with Japanese
patrol boats as a way to pressure Japan to come to the negotiation
table.</P>
      <P>If Japan still won't talk in goodwill, Wang said, he will not
rule out the possibility of mobilizing fishermen to stage a protest
at the Interchange Association, Japan's de facto embassy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsu stressed that Taiwan and Japan could consult over
the overlapping economic zones, but Japan has turned a deaf ear to
Taiwan's appeal for talks for fear of pressure from China.</P>
      <P>Hsu asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Coast Guard
Administration and the Fisheries Administration to form a task force
to review the issue.</P>
      <P>Coast Guard Administration Vice Minister Chung Tung-sheng said
the administration will protect the fishing boats based on the
principles of sovereignty and peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Sha Chi-i, deputy head of the Fisheries Administration under the
Council of Agriculture, said Taiwan and Japan have conducted 14
rounds of talks since Japan in 1996 demarcated its 200-nautical mile
economic zone, which includes parts of Taiwan's exclusive economic
zone.</P>
      <P>Sha said the issue of the overlapping economic zones involves
sovereignty and the distribution of interests, which he termed as
highly complex issues. He added that the 14 rounds of talks focused
on the development and regeneration of the fisheries stocks in the
zones.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said that the
government should study the overlapping economic zones based on the
facts, history, and the international situation to work out the
government's stance and then express that stance firmly to the
international community.</P>
      <P>Lee Sheng-feng, secretary-general of the opposition New Party,
said that the government should rigorously enforce its authority in
protecting the fishermen, and only by doing so can Japan be pressured
to come to the negotiation table.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsao Shou-ming of the opposition Kuomintang said
countries should deal with bilateral issues based on the principles
of equality and mutual benefits. If Japanese patrol boats chase away
or seize Taiwan fishing vessels, then the Taiwan government should do
the same to Japanese vessels, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
hopes to convene a 15th round of fishery negotiations with Japan to
resolve the problems incurred as a result of their overlapping
exclusive economic zones, a foreign ministry official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Song-huann, director of MOFA's Department of East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, made the remarks one day after nearly 50 Taiwan
fishing boats converged in waters northeast of Taiwan to protest
against Japanese patrol ships, which chase them away from the
disputed area.</P>
      <P>The fishermen initially wanted to confront the Japanese patrol
boats but the protest fizzled out when no patrol boats showed up and
only several Japanese reconnaissance planes monitored the situation.</P>
      <P>Lin said that before Taiwan and Japan negotiate a provisional
boundary, Taiwan fishermen should stay within the patrol line of
Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration patrol boats.</P>
      <P>He said that following the protest, the ministry has on one hand
lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities urging them to
exercise self-restraint, while on the other hand asking for a 15th
round of talks.</P>
      <P>At issue is the formulation of a law regarding its exclusive
economic zone and continental shelf by Japan in 1996, which includes
parts of Taiwan's exclusive economic zone within its 200-mile
economic zone.</P>
      <P>Because of this demarcation, which Taiwan feels is unreasonable,
the two countries have conducted 14 rounds of talks on the issue
since 1996.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC WELCOMES CHINESE MEDIA POSTED IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) welcomes more media from around China to station staff in
Taiwan to help improve bilateral understanding across the Taiwan
Strait, MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung said Friday.</P>
      <P>The MAC is at present assessing the possibility of allowing
Taiwan press accreditation for two Chinese local dailies -- the First
Financial Daily of Shanghai and the Guangdong Nanfang Daily -- You
said at a regular press meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan would like to see more local Chinese media stationed in
Taiwan so long as the Beijing authorities do not "interfere
intentionally," You said.</P>
      <P>You reiterated that the MAC is opening Taiwan's doors wider to
more local Chinese media, mainly out of consideration that more and
more local media around China have shown dynamism and professionalism
since China's opening and reform policies have taken root.</P>
      <P>Saying that the MAC's opening policy has no ulterior motives, You
added that as long as Beijing does not interfere "on purpose, " it
will be no problem allowing both central- and local-level Chinese
media to cover news in Taiwan in the near future.</P>
      <P>The MAC halted press accreditation for China's official Xinhua
news agency and People's Daily newspaper in April this year on the
grounds that "their coverage of Taiwan was not conducive to enhancing
understanding between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said at that time that the purpose of
allowing Chinese media organizations to station staff in Taiwan -- a
practice that began in 2000 -- was to help the two sides better
understand each other.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Wu said, some Chinese media groups have focused
only on the most extreme or radical opinions in Taiwan's political
spectrum, which is not helpful to efforts to strengthen cross-strait
understanding.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu said, the Chinese authorities have blocked news
reports about Taiwan in all media channels, including Websites,
another move that does not help Chinese people to gain better
understanding of Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu noted that the government will not cease media
exchanges with China across the board and that other unofficial
Chinese news media organizations will still have the opportunity to
come to Taiwan to cover news.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added, any media, cultural or educational
exchanges should be strictly assessed if they are found unhelpful to
efforts to cement cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>At least five Chinese media organizations, including Xinhua,
People's Daily, China National Radio, China Central Television and
China News Service, have stationed journalists in Taiwan since the
country first allowed Chinese news media organizations entry to
Taiwan Nov. 10, 2000.</P>
      <P>All these arrangements have been on a trial basis, with each
visit lasting for only two months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL LEADERS PAY HOMAGE TO LATE DHARMA MASTER YIN SHUN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu  City,  northern  Taiwan,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen
Shui-bian, Premier Frank Hsieh, Minister of the Interior Su
Jia-chyuan and other government officials traveled to Hsinchu Friday
to pay homage respectively to the late Dharma Master Yin Shun, who
passed away June 4 at the age of 100.</P>
      <P>They offered incense to a picture of Yin Shun and paid their last
respects to his remains in a ceremony held at the Fu Yan Monastery,
where Yin Shun had resided for several decades and where his ashes
will be kept permanently.</P>
      <P>Born in Haining, in China's Zhejiang Province in 1906, Yin Shun
became a Buddhist monk at the age of 24. As one of the most venerable
Dharma masters in the Buddhist world, Yin Shun is remembered the most
for his core philosophy of "humanizing Buddhism and bringing
bodhisattvas into the world."</P>
      <P>Known to his followers as the "savior of the world, " Yin Shun's
teachings include the espousal of "benefiting others is the priority
of all deeds and thoughts."</P>
      <P>Yin Shun received an doctorate from Japan's Taisho University for
one of his many books, named "The Zen History of China," published in
Taipei in 1971.</P>
      <P>His concept of "humanized Buddhism" has been devoutly undertaken
by Master Cheng Yen, founder of Taiwan's largest charity organization
the Tzu Chi Compassionate Relief Foundation, and her millions of
followers.</P>
      <P>Like her mentor, Master Cheng Yen is also a practitioner of
Buddhism who encourages her disciples to take what they have learned
from Buddhist philosophy and practice it in daily life.</P>
      <P>Yin Shun had a simple and spartan lifestyle, so his disciples
decided to keep his funeral simple but solemn, said a Fu Yan
Monastery spokesman.</P>

      <P>Two staff members at Taiwan's

missing while on a mountain-climbing trip, an official said Friday.</P>

Tsai Wan-ting, a Taiwan citizen in her 20s, was reported missing
during a recent climbing vacation on the northern Japanese island of

      <P>Japanese police have launched an all-out search over the past few

fallen into a ravine.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When Greek fugitive Apostolos Vavilis was
arrested April in Italy after a 10-week international manhunt, most
people might not have been aware that the Taiwan police played a
crucial role in the operation leading to his arrest.</P>
      <P>It was the first time the Taiwan police had taken part in a
operation jointly launched by Interpol and the Greek and Italian
authorities. It was also its first participation in the hunt for a
criminal wanted by the European Police Office (Europol).</P>
      <P>According to the International Criminal Affairs Section of the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) , the representative of Greek
police to Interpol, George Vanikiotis, requested Taiwan police in
late February to assist in tracing Vavilis.</P>
      <P>A key figure in a string of scandals involving the Orthodox
Church of Greece, Vavilis was believed to have fled to Taiwan or
another country with the help of his Taiwanese friends.</P>
      <P>The CIB was told that Vavilis maintained close links with the
church and political communities in Greece, Europe and the Middle
East and used at least six different identities.</P>
      <P>Based on information provided by Greek police, the CIB discovered
that Vavilis had departed for Thailand and had made hundreds of
flight reservations to try to shake off the police.</P>
      <P>After an analysis of the flight information, the CIB concluded
that Vavilis could have headed for Rome via Bangkok and Athens using
one of his aliases, Antonios Aivaliotis, and passed the information
to Greek police.</P>
      <P>Greek police later spotted him in Italy by monitoring his e-mail
and credit card use, and he was arrested in the Italian city of
Bologna April 22, holding a fake Greek passport under the name of
Antonios Aivaliotis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA TO OFFER AID TO JAPAN-BOUND ABORIGINAL PROTESTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
offer all necessary assistance to an aboriginal delegation that will
travel to Japan June 13 to protest Japan's atrocities during World
War II, a senior official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Song-huann, director of the MOFA's East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Department, made the remarks after meeting with aboriginal
Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei, who will head the delegation.</P>
      <P>In response to Kao Chin's complaint that the nation's
representative office in Tokyo has asked her delegation to keep a low
profile during the visit, Lin said the MOFA has already directed the
representative office to offer all necessary aid to ensure her
group's safety.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin said her delegation will mainly be composed of offspring
of the Kaosha Warrior Group, a band of indigenous Taiwan people
drafted by the Japanese authorities to fight for Japan during World
War II, when Taiwan was still under Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker from the opposition Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
said her mission will demand a Japanese apology for its forcing
Taiwan aborigines into war and compensation for bereaved members of
the Kaosha Warrior Group.</P>
      <P>Another major purpose of the visit is to push Japan to remove
tablets dedicated to Kaosha warriors' souls from its controversial
Yasukuni Shrine in downtown Tokyo, Kao Chin said.</P>
      <P>The Yasukuni Shrine commemorates and worships those who died in
war for Japan. However, the shrine has become a symbol of Japan's
militant past, since the tablets of more than 1,000 convicted war
criminals, including 14 Class-A war criminals, were installed there
in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin said the offspring of the Kaosha Warrior Group do not
want to see their ancestors' souls worshipped at the controversial
shrine any longer.</P>
      <P>During Kao Chin's visit to the MOFA office, Lin promised her that
the representative office in Japan will offer her group technical
assistance to ensure their trip is a safe and smooth one.</P>
      <P>"We have directed our representative office in Tokyo to keep
close contact with the Japanese police to ensure that your delegation
will not be harassed by any Japanese rightwing nationalistic groups
during its stay in Japan," Lin told the actress-turned-lawmaker.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GRAND JUSTICES FREEZE APPLICATION OF FINGERPRINTING ON NEW ID CARDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices passed a
provisional ruling to temporarily freeze the application of an
article of the Household Registration Law that requires
fingerprinting when claiming national identification cards.</P>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices announced the provisional ruling
after discussing a request filed by the legislative caucus of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) May 30 to invalidate the
fingerprinting provision in the Household Registration Law.</P>
      <P>Article 8 of the law stipulates that people claiming new national
identification cards must be fingerprinted, which critics say
encroaches upon their basic human rights.</P>
      <P>The ruling states that establishing files on fingerprinting will
consume a large amount of human and material costs and that if the
files later have to be destroyed because of the unconstitutionality
of the law upon which such files are built, it will be a tremendous
waste of administrative resources.</P>
      <P>In addition, whether or not the fingerprinting encroaches on the
basic rights of the public enshrined in the Constitution is a
controversial issue.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the provision requiring fingerprinting will be
suspended, the justices said in the provisional ruling.</P>
      <P>The provisional ruling will only be invalidated when the grand
justices make a constitutional interpretation on Article 8 of the
Household Registration Law or six months after the promulgation of
the temporary ruling at the latest.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman of the Executive Yuan said the Cabinet
will work with the provisional ruling of the grand justices, and that
the renewal of ID cards, which was scheduled to begin July 1 for one
year, will be put on hold.</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai said that people over the age of 14 claiming their
ID cards for the first time will be issued the old type of ID cards
and will not be fingerprinted. After the grand justices make their
interpretation, these people will have to go through the entire
process again for new ID cards.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKER SUGGESTS GOVERNMENT HELP IN FISHERY DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    June   10   (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Joanna Lei urged the government Friday to seek to
participate in relevant world bodies as "an entity" in order to speak
for the people in Taiwan in fishery disputes and other international
issues.</P>
      <P>Addressing a recent fishery dispute between Taiwan and Japan, Lei
said that it is extremely important for the government to seek
participation in international organizations to voice the interests
of the Taiwan people and she called on the government to clearly
underline Taiwan's stance on the issue in order to protect the
interests of Taiwan fishermen.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is unable to join the United Nations and other
international organizations as a result of pressure from Beijing, Lei
prodded the government to do so as "an entity" on the grounds that
protecting the people's interests is the top and the most urgent
issue for the government.</P>
      <P>Citing a notion advocated by Myres S. McDougal, a renowned
authority on international law and the co-founder of the New Haven
School, the KMT lawmaker explained that McDougal's method is oriented
toward an attainable policy that respects human dignity, in contrast
to the purely analytical forms that preceded it.</P>
      <P>She contended that the government must seek a greater
international presence to help the people of Taiwan reach out when
facing difficulties in the international arena, despite the country's
diplomatic isolation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has already joined several regional fishery organizations
thanks to its key role in the international deep-sea fishing
industry, she noted, but added that it is worth noting whether the
matter will develop into an international incident.</P>
      <P>Nearly 50 Taiwan fishing vessels from Suao tried Thursday to
encircle a Japanese petrol boat which had chased Taiwan vessels out
of an area about 86 nautical miles off Taiwan's northeastern coast
where the 200-mile exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan
overlap.</P>
      <P>In the last two years, Taiwan fishing ships operating in the area
have been dispersed or detained by Japanese patrol vessels, fanning
resentment among the Taiwan fishermen whose livelihoods have been
seriously affected.</P>
      <P>Lin Yueh-ying, a chief delegate of the Suao Fishermen's
Association in Ilan County, pointed out that the interests of
domestic fishermen were greatly hurt after Japan readjusted and
expanded its exclusive economic zone to as close as some 20 nautical
miles off the coasts of Ilan and Hualien counties.</P>
      <P>"Japan has gone too far and has been detestable, " Lin said,
complaining that "Taiwan fishermen are so unfairly treated that they
do not want to keep silent and swallow their anger any more."</P>
      <P>In the face of the fishery dispute arising from the overlap in
the exclusive economic zones of the two countries, the government
must send more patrol ships to step up protection of Taiwan fishermen
in the short term, industry sources said, arguing that on the other
hand, Taiwan must try to ink a mutually recognized accord with Japan
to secure the long-term interests of Taiwan fishermen.</P>
      <P>Resolving the issue through diplomatic approaches may be a
time-consuming task, but it is a more practical and secure way to
achieve the aim, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's fishery authorities have actually held unsuccessful
negotiations with Japan 14 times in the hope of settling the dispute.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>To encourage local youths to get a deeper
affinity with their nation during the approaching summer vacation,
the National Youth Commission (NYC) has organized a series of Taiwan
study tour packages to allow young people to see, feel and touch the
land where they live.</P>
      <P>A total of 13 theme camps are included in the NYC "Youth
Study-Travel Taiwan" project. The camps are designed with an
itinerary including tourist visits, physical training, public
discussions, tours to national establishments and experience-oriented
learning, according to the NYC.</P>
      <P>Of the theme camps, perhaps the weirdest is what the NYC is
calling an "experience camp in jail" in Chiayi, southern Taiwan.
Participants will be handcuffed, chained and fed prison food in jail
to "let them feel what it's like if a person loses freedom, " an
official said.</P>
      <P>Besides the jail camp, there is also a baseball camp in which
participants will visit a series of baseball fields around the
country, as well as learn about the sport and play.</P>
      <P>NYC Chairwoman Chen Li-chun noted that study tours do not have to
be in a foreign country. The innovative "Youth Study-Travel Taiwan"
program could not only allow students to travel, but also gain an
in-depth knowledge of Taiwan, she claimed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to make Taiwan a tourist destination for foreign
youths, the theme camps will also be open for them. According to the
NYC, each theme camp will have three vacancies for foreign students.</P>

special task force to review the steps, method and strategy to
promote a second phase of constitutional reforms, a top presidential
aide said Friday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun said the review

constitutional reform committee should be established to facilitate
the reforms.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, President Chen Shui-bian is very happy about the
successful passage of a constitutional amendment package early this

      <P>Yu said it remains the government's goal to upgrade the country's
competitiveness through the reforms and to have a new constitution
implemented in 2008 together with the inauguration of the new
president, legislature and administration.</P>
      <P>Issues to be addressed in the second phase of reforms will
include the introduction of a voluntary military service system,
civil rights, labor rights and human rights protection, as well as
the enhancement of welfare for the country's aboriginal population.</P>
      <P>The mission-oriented National Assembly passed on Tueday a
constitutional amendment package to scrap the assembly to allow for
popular referendums on future constitutional amendments, to reduce
the number of legislative seats from the present 225 to 113 and to
adopt a "single seat, two votes" electoral system starting with the
seventh legislature to be elected in 2007.</P>
      <P>Officials have promised that the next phase of reforms will not
involve sensitive issues such as changes to the country's

      <P>The Repulic of China's (ROC's)

government has begun to deny him access to a restricted area of the
Hong Kong airport.</P>
      <P>Pao Cheng-kang, head of the Bureau of Hong Kong Affairs under the

exclusion began on April 18 when he was not allowed to enter the
off-limits area to welcome opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan.
The incident was described at the time by Hong Kong authorities as a
case of poor coordination.</P>
      <P>His application to enter the same area to welcome Taichung
Mayor Jason Hu on June 6 was also rejected, Pao said.</P>
      <P>It is uncertain if the measure is temporary or permanent, but
political analysts said if it is permanent, it will be a major

      <P>The representative of the ROC did not enjoy the privilege of
entering the restricted area of the airport until the handover of

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian issued a decree
Friday promulgating a package of constitutional amendments passed by
the ad hoc National Assembly Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The package comprises amendments to Articles 1, 2, 4, 5 and 8 of
the Additional Articles of the ROC Constitution plus adding Article
12, the presidential decree said.</P>
      <P>The new amendments will affect five aspects of the government:</P>
      <P>-- Legislative downsizing: Beginning with the next Legislative
Yuan to be elected in 2007, the number of legislators will be cut to
113 from the current 225 and their terms will be extended from three
years to four years.</P>
      <P>-- Legislative electoral system: The next legislature will be
elected through a "single-seat constituency, two ballots" system
instead of the current "single vote, multiple-seat constituency"
system. Voters will cast two ballots, one for the constituency and
another for political parties in at-large proportional
representation.</P>
      <P>-- Abolishment of the National Assembly: The National Assembly's
powers to ratify future constitutional amendments and impeach the
president or vice president will be transferred to other institutions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 10-volume collection of color comic books
in English and Chinese on the history of Taiwan was published Friday,
with an online version also released.</P>
      <P>The collection called, "A History of Taiwan in Comics, " was
published by Third Nature Publishing Company under the commission of
the Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC) and the
Council for Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>A number of historians double-checked the accuracy of the
information in the comics, said the editor in chief of the project,
Wu Mi-cha, a professor of history at National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>The collection took two years and more than NT$10 million
(US$320,000) to finish. It features the changes that have occurred in
politics, culture and society in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said that although they may only be comic books, the set
contains more information than current history textbooks, adding that
the books provide an insight into the fascinating lifestyles and
values of the numerous ethnic groups that have lived in Taiwan over
the years.</P>
      <P>Since the collection is also in English, it can help foreigners

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER LOOKING FORWARD TO TAIWAN-U.S. FREE TRADE PACT BY NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday he is
looking forward to entering into a free trade agreement (FTA) with
the United States by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>At a meeting in his office with Tom Johnson, president of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, the premier said negotiations
on the FTA, which began in 2002, have had some bumpy patches because
of the complexity of the issues involved.</P>
      <P>However, since an FTA between Taiwan and the United States would
boost bilateral trade, especially U.S. exports to Taiwan, it would be
beneficial for both sides, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the premier said, such an agreement would encourage
other nations to follow the lead of the U.S. in signing similar
agreements with Taiwan, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He thanked the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei for its
backing of an FTA and for its sound advice, which was spelled out in
its 2005 White Paper on Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LI AO'S SMOKING GUN DOCUMENT SHOOTS BLANKS: PROSECUTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The alleged CIA report that independent
Legislator Li Ao says is the smoking gun that shows that the
president set up his own assassination attempt is a dud, prosecution
authorities said Friday.</P>
      <P>The document that Li produced as genuine to back his claim that
the shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette
Lu on March 19, 2004 was staged is in the hands of the Tainan
Prosecutors' Office in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors who have examined the document said that it is
riddled with errors -- including calling the vice president by the
surname of Lee -- and is written entirely in Chinese.</P>
      <P>Li claimed Wednesday that the document is a bone fide
intelligence report from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).</P>
      <P>Initial examinations indicated that the source of the document is
unlikely to be the CIA, officials said, adding that the task force
investigating the presidential election-eve shooting will check the
authenticity of the document via normal channels.</P>
      <P>Li claimed earlier this week that he had obtained a CIA report
saying that President Chen staged his own election-eve shooting to
win sympathy and ensure his re-election. Quoting the document, Li
alleged that Chen employed two snipers to kill or injure Lu so that
he would get sympathy votes.</P>
      <P>The alleged CIA document identified one sniper as Chen Yi-hsiung
and the other as someone surnamed Lee.</P>
      <P>The investigative team announced earlier this year that it had
discovered that the likely shooter was Chen Yi-hsiung, who allegedly
committed suicide by drowning himself in a canal in the southern city
of Tainan shortly after the March 20 presidential election in which
the Chen-Lu ticket won by a slim margin.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the task force said the document in question did
not give additional details on the full name of the person surnamed
Lee and gave no supporting evidence for any of the other claims.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Presidential Office official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the document uses a great deal of emotionally
charged and biased phraseology.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, the official said, CIA reports
are known for their objectivity, neutrality and cautiousness. It
would be out of character for a CIA report to use emotional or
radical wording, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CGA SHIPS COULD  SAIL TO 'OVERLAPPING AREAS' TO PROTECT FISHERMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh has ordered coast guard
patrol ships to sail, if necessary, to the overlapping areas of
Taiwan's and Japan's exclusive economic zones to protect local
fishermen's legitimate fishing rights, Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Cho made the remarks a day after about 60 Taiwanese trawlers
converged in waters about 80 nautical miles east of northern Taiwan
to protest Japanese coast guard ships' chasing them from their
traditional fishing grounds on many occasions.</P>
      <P>The waters near a number of small, uninhabited islands known as
the Tiaoyutais, which are claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China, have
been Taiwan's traditional fishing grounds. However, Japan demarcated
the area as part of its 200-mile economic zone in 1996 and has since
often impounded Taiwanese fishing vessels that enter the region and
have fined their owners. The absence of formal diplomatic ties has
made it difficult to resolve the disputes.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Premier Hsieh is concerned about local fishermen's
well-being, Cho said the premier has demanded that the Coast Guard
Administration (CGA) take necessary steps at appropriate time to
defend the nation's sovereignty and fishing rights.</P>
      <P>"The premier has asked that CGA patrol ships, if necessary, to
sail to the overlapping areas of the economic zones to protect our
fishermen's fishing rights," Cho said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Cho said, the government will endeavor to prevent
the issue from becoming an international dispute.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cho said, the premier has directed diplomatic agencies
to work closely with fishery authorities in negotiating with Japan
over the issue.</P>
      <P>Fishery officials from Taiwan and Japan have held 14 rounds of
talks on the Tiaoyutai fishing rights issue, but have failed to reach
an agreement because of the sovereignty dispute. Taiwan is pushing
Japan to open a 15th round of talks as soon as possible.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Legislator
Chang Chun-hsiung was sworn in Friday as chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) which is charged with the country's
dealings with China in the absence of formal ties between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Chang, who had served as premier between 2000 and 2002, called
for resumption of exchanges with the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), the SEF's Beijing counterpart, after his
new post was approved by the board of SEF directors, saying that
exchanges should not stop because of the controversy over whether or
not there is a consensus between the two sides about the meaning of
"one China" in their meeting in 1992.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which believes there was a consensus reached on the
issue in its favor at the time, refused to resume exchanges after
Taiwan said no such consensus was reached.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the spirit of 1992 meeting between SEF and ARATS is
"sidestepping controversies, respecting each other, talking and
negotiating", the new SEF chief said it will bode well for bilateral
ties if both sides of the strait can engage with the other based on
this spirit.</P>
      <P>However, he admitted the resumption of exchanges between the SEF
and ARATS involving a lot of factors, many of which are beyond the
control of the SEF.</P>
      <P>Before the resumption of exchanges, Chang said the SEF will focus
its attention on serving Taiwan businessmen working on the mainland
especially those who are embroiled in legal disputes there.</P>
      <P>He disputed critics' challenges about the legality of his double
role as a lawmaker and the SEF chief, arguing that he is not the only
legislator who serves concurrently as head of a non-governmental
organization, and in any case, he is not being paid for working with
the SEF.</P>
      <P>Chang will serve out the remaining term of his predecessor, Koo
Chen-fu, who died on Jan. 3 before his term ends on Dec. 1.</P>

Wall Street Journal: New Orders, After Four Years in the Rear,
Boeing Is Set to Jet Past Airbus

The European jet maker Airbus had already surpassed Boeing Co. as
the No. 1 builder of jetliners. Last year, it trounced Boeing in
every key sales campaign. Since Boeing replaced its chief salesman,
Boeing is on track this year to win more new orders than Airbus after
four years in second place, both companies say. At the heart of
today's race is the market for the industry's workhorses: the midsize
planes used on transcontinental and transoceanic flights. Propelling
Boeing back into the lead is the 787, the first plane to be designed
from scratch since the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the first to fully

      <P>Top health officials on Saturday denied
reports that the self-payment ratio for outpatients and emergency
patients under the national health insurance system will be raised
July 16.</P>
      <P>Both Department of Health Deputy Minister Chen Tzay-jinn and
Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) President Liu Chien-hsiang
denied the reports.</P>

      <P>Liu said that if the self-payment ratio is raised, it is
estimated that about 20 percent of patients will be affected.</P>
      <P>Liu said that most of the patients will not feel the extra burden
if they are transferred to other hospitals, adding that chronic

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will invite mayors
and magistrates from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as
well as the heads of the DPP chapters in cities and counties around
the country to a tea party next Tuesday, a lawmaker said Saturday.</P>
      <P>William Lai, a DPP legislative whip, said the informal meeting at
the Taipei Guest House is aimed at forging intraparty consensus on
strategy for the year-end local government chiefs elections.</P>
      <P>President Chen has organized four similar meetings with DPP
legislators since May 18 to explore lawmakers' views on major policy
issues.</P>
      <P>"All those meetings have proved effective in forging intraparty
consensus on important public issues, " Lai said, adding that
President Chen attaches great importance to opinions and counseling
offered by DPP lawmakers at those closed-door meetings.</P>
      <P>As the year-end local government chiefs elections are expected to
have a great impact on the future domestic political development and
the DPP administration's power base, Lai said, President Chen wants
to learn more about incumbent DPP mayors and magistrates' opinions on
the party's platform and campaign strategy for the year-end
elections.</P>
      <P>Lai said Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Frank Hsieh, DPP

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE DENIES REPORT OF CONTACT WITH CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Presidential Office spokesman denied
Saturday a media report that some Beijing messengers have offered to
help establish direct contact between Chinese President Hu Jintao and
President Chen Shui-bian to pave the way for a cross-Taiwan Strait
summit.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the report as mere speculation, Chen Wen-tzung,
director of the Presidential Office's Department of Public Affairs,
said the Presidential Office has never received any such information
and has no plan to assign any presidential aides for the mission.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that President Chen has mentioned on many
occasions that cross-strait differences must be resolved through
dialogue and that a government-to-government format is inevitable in
conducting such talks.</P>
      <P>The president welcomes a meeting with Hu as long as it is not
subject to any preconditions and believes cross-strait talks must be
based on a national consensus and the best interests of the Taiwan
people, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Also, Chen said the Hong Kong visit by Presidential Office
official Chao Lin from May 18-20 was only a private trip.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the Beijing messengers have proposed
that contact be established through presidential aides of both sides,
with the possible choices being Hu's premier aide, Ling Jihua, and
Chen's close aide, Ma Yung-cheng.</P>
      <P>The report said that Chao might have been assigned with the
mission of meeting with some Beijing representatives during his Hong
Kong visit.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the report, William C.T. Lai, a whip of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislative caucus, urged the
media to stop circulating rumors that are not based on facts.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that President Chen has said he is not afraid to
negotiate with China provided that Taiwan's sovereignty, democracy
and peace are secured and that he is willing to meet Hu in a third
country.</P>
      <P>But this scenario will only be possible through the mediation of
the international community, and the visits to China by opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and opposition People First Party
Chairman James Soong have proven futile in changing Beijing's mind
concerning its desire to annex Taiwan, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIEMENS FACTORY WORKERS CONCERNED ABOUT BENQ'S RECENT ACQUISITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  June  11 (CNA)
(By Y.L.Lin and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many of the more than 1,800 employees
working at the mobile phone factory of Siemens AG in Kamp-Lintfort, a
small town of just over 40,000 people in Germany, have expressed
concerns about their fate following BenQ's recent acquisition of the
factory.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-based BenQ Group announced June 7 the acquisition of
Siemens AG's Mobile Devices Business and said that the acquisition
will create the world's fourth largest handset maker as well as the
largest mobile phone technology company in Greater China, bringing
BenQ's combined annual revenue to US$10.9 billion.</P>
      <P>However, George Nassauer, president of the Union of Siemens AG,
told the Central News Agency bluntly in a telephone interview that
the workers do not want to join BenQ Group because they do not know
the new owner of the factory. The workers are also worried about job
security, he added.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that BenQ Group is currently comprised of ten
companies and five main business groups and units to produce various
products in the fields of display and imaging, networking and
communications, digital computer and storage business, and so on, in
the eyes of German consumers, the group is only a LCD panel maker and
is not a familiar brand to them.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, many Germans expressed surprise at
hearing that the renowned Siemens AG's mobile phone device business
had been acquired by an unknown company from Taiwan as they take
great pride in Siemens-made mobile phones, just like Leica cameras
and Agfa films.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Michael Leuker, president of the factory's union,
also criticized Siemens AG's executives, saying that they are all
inexperienced in running the factory and admitting that under Siemens
leadership, there will be no future for the factory's employees.</P>
      <P>The headquarters of Siemens AG had planned earlier to move the
factory to Hungary due to high labor costs in Germany. In order to
prevent it from doing so, the factory employees agreed to an increase
in work hours from 35 hours per week to 40 hours without a
corresponding salary increase.</P>
      <P>However, the factory's average daily losses of 1.5 million euros
in the first quarter of this year led Siemens Group to decide to sell
the factory in order to avoid harming the group's reputation,
ignoring the union's appeals that the group first try to save the
factory with its partners.</P>
      <P>A German weekly reported recently that the factory is brimming
with an atmosphere of fear, anger and sadness over news of the sale
to BenQ.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the factory workers no longer trust their old
bosses, Leuker said that the urgent need for Benq Group is to
eliminate the employees' feelings of fears and uncertainty.</P>
      <P>He also said that the group should not only establish mutual
trust with their German employees, it should also work on boosting
German consumers' confidence in Siemens-made mobile phones.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that despite an increase of 9 percent in global
mobile phone production in the first quarter of this year,
Siemens-made mobile phone market share registered a decline of 2.5
percent.</P>
      <P>Another concern of the factory employees is that German media
have reported that BenQ just wants to use the Siemens AG's brand to
gain a foothold in markets in Europe and Russia and that mobile phone
products with the Siemens brand will eventually disappear once the
Taiwanese group achieves its goal.</P>
      <P>A German daily also revealed recently that the name of Siemens
AG's Mobile Devices Business will be changed to BenQ Mobile Devices
in the future, showing that the Taiwanese group is not interested in
the German electronics giant's brand name.</P>
      <P>As to questions regarding the future of the factory, many believe
that it all depends on whether the new owner can reduce production
costs and that it is unavoidable for BenQ Group to lay off employees.</P>
      <P>Declining to give a response to a question relating to the
possibility of the new owner laying off workers at the factory with
severance pay, Leuker said that his union is planning to take the
necessary steps to deal with this possibility. "You can imagine our
feelings," he added.</P>
      <P>Siemens AG is a global powerhouse in electrical engineering and
electronics and has roughly 440,000 employees.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AGRICULTURE MINISTER WELCOMES PROPOSED TAX CUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Lee
Chin-lung on Saturday welcomed the premier's announcement Friday that
the business tax on household, medical and agricultural products will
be reduced in the future.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the council will be happy to see the proposed tax
cut implemented, saying it will not only lower the burden of taxation
on farmers and fishermen, but also encourage consumers to purchase
domestically-produced farm goods.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh announced the policy after he ordered the
formation of a special task force June 5 to flesh out tax reform
measures in line with President Shui-bian's directives for taxation
reform last week.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said that some of the items in the three major
categories will not be subject to business taxation in order to help
disadvantaged people.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the tax cut will help farmers and fishermen, whose
earnings are normally less than those employed in other sectors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, David Huang, the convener of the legislative caucus of
the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union, praised the new policy as the
right way to go, saying that taxes on items concerning people's basic
needs should be lowered, while those on luxury or other consumer
products should be hiked to properly reflect economic growth.</P>
      <P>Huang added that all details concerning the tax reform plan
should be put on table to allow all relevant parties to discuss them
and give their input. A national consensus on the tax reform
proposals is definitely needed before the government implements them,
he stressed.</P>
      <P>At the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's caucus office at the
Legislative Yuan, a party whip, Chen Chin-jun, urged the public to
"have a healthier attitude" toward the government's tax reform
proposals, which include raising the national tax rate to 15 percent
from the current 13.6 percent, as well as hiking business tax rates
and those of some other categories.</P>
      <P>Many critics misinterpreted the proposal as an across-the-board
tax hike.</P>
      <P>Defending the president's six-point tax reform plan unveiled last
week, the legislator explained that the plan is aimed at broadening
the tax base and establishing a taxation system that is based on the
principles of fairness and social justice.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Department of Health (DOH)
official said Saturday that a self-payment ratio hike for outpatients
and emergency patients is scheduled to be announced June 15.</P>
      <P>DOH Secretary-General Lai Chin-hsiang also said the hike is
expected to be put into effect July 16.</P>
      <P>His words came after Department of Health Deputy Minister Chen
Tzay-jinn and Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) President
Liu Chien-hsiang earlier in the day denied such reports.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the DOH and the BNHI are hoping for a
hike in the self-payment ratio, they will respect the decision of a
national health insurance supervisory committee on when to put it
into effect.</P>
      <P>However, Lai said that the self-payment amount for outpatients
and emergency patients will be raised, while the self-payment amount
for those visiting Chinese medicine doctors or dentists will not be
raised.</P>
      <P>Lai said a national health insurance supervisory committee is not
opposed to the hike, but it has expressed the hope that the DOH will
prepare complementary measures.</P>
      <P>According to the fee hike plan envisaged by the BNHI, the
self-payment amount for outpatients for district, regional and
national medical center hospitals will be raised to NT$80 (US$2.54) ,
NT$240 and NT$360, respectively, from the present NT$50, NT$140 and
NT$210, while the self-payment amount for emergency patients for
regional and national medical center hospitals will be raised to
NT$300 and NT$450, respectively, from the current NT$210 and NT$420.</P>
      <P>A double hike of health insurance premiums and the self-payment
ratio was put into effect in September 2003 despite opposition from

      <P>A Kuomintang (KMT) official suggested
Saturday that the nominees of the KMT and its "pan-blue alliance"
ally People First Party (PFP) for the year-end city and county chief
elections first coordinate among themselves to produce only one joint

      <P>Liao Feng-teh, director of the KMT's Organization and Development

candidates of the KMT and the PFP.</P>
      <P>Both parties have decided to start to talk about cooperation in
the year-end elections on June 22, when the two parties will have
decided their candidates for the elections.</P>
      <P>Liao said that the KMT has prepared its own integration mechanism
for the two parties and that it will consider whether to conduct
public and party opinion polls or consult opinion leaders among the
candidates of the two parties. The top leaders of the two parties
will decide on this matter, he added.</P>
      <P>He said the city and county chief elections concern local affairs

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR PROPOSES EXPANDING FUNCTION OF 'MINI THREE LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Taiwan,  June  11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on
Saturday proposed that the government expand the function of the
"mini three links" as an interchange between Taiwan and China before
direct cross-Taiwan Strait transportation links are opened up.</P>
      <P>Ma, who also serves as a vice chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and is a candidate in the party's upcoming
chairmanship election, put forth the proposal during a campaign stop
on the frontline island of Kinmen, which has maintained ferry service
to China's Xiamen port since 2001.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that while only around 20,000 people took trips
between Taiwan and China via Kinmen in 2001, the figure is expected
to top 500,000 this year, which he said shows that Kinmen can play a
more positive role as a cross-strait interchange to enhance exchanges
of people between both sides.</P>
      <P>Ma said related facilities in Kinmen should be improved to make
it more convenient for people, especially China-based Taiwanese
businesspeople, to use Kinmen as a transit to travel across the
strait.</P>
      <P>With the Kinmen airport enjoying a tourist capacity of five
million a year, Kinmen should have no problem becoming a transit
alternative to Hong Kong and Macau for cross-strait travelers, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>On his KMT chairmanship bid, Ma pledged that if he is elected, he
will integrate the "pan-blue alliance, " stabilize cross-strait
relations, reject Taiwan independence as a possible option for
Taiwan's future and lead the party back to power in 2008.</P>
      <P>Ma said he will also fight for the rights of Kinmen residents in
order to reciprocate for their sacrifices over the past decades.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS SHOULD ONLY BE HELD FOR URGENT BILLS: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Facing the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) administration's call for an extra legislative session, the
legislative caucus of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Saturday
that extra sessions should only be held to deal with urgent bills for
the benefit of the people.</P>
      <P>Chen Chieh, the KMT legislative caucus whip, told reporters that
he is willing to hold talks with his counterparts of other parties on
the issue of holding an extra session. However, he stressed that
extra sessions should only be held to deal with urgent bills that
concern the well-being of the people.</P>
      <P>He said that if the DPP wants the extra session simply to address
bills for its own benefit, then the KMT is against it.</P>
      <P>Referring to a special budget bill for the Executive Yuan's
long-stalled arms procurement plan, the lawmaker suggested that the
Ministry of National Defense rearrange the planned spending for the
procurement by including it in its annual budgets, instead of calling
for an extra budget bill.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tzeng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT's
Central Policy Coordinating Commission, claimed that the ruling DPP
sees the holding of extra sessions as part of the Legislative Yuan's
normal operations, warning that such an attitude could damage the
system.</P>
      <P>Besides, he added, the Legislature has just concluded its first
session and there are still five to go before it finishes its current
term in 2007. The KMT doesn't believe it is urgent at present for the
Legislative Yuan to call an extra session, Tzeng said, adding that if
the DPP legislative caucus proposes an extra session, then the KMT
may oppose it.</P>
      <P>Upon the end of the last legislative session May 31, Premier
Frank Hsieh expressed the hope that an extra session would be called
to screen bills that he described as "critical, " which include those
related to the arms procurement package and Executive Yuan
restructuring, revisions to the liquor and tobacco taxation law, a
special statute on flood control, and a statute on the establishment
of a labor pension fund supervisory commission, as well as to review
President Chen Shui-bian's list of Control Yuan member nominees.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, one
of the two candidates in the upcoming main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) chairmanship election, presented his first round of campaign
ads in the print media Saturday in search of support from KMT
members.</P>
      <P>Wang is running against Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou in the election
slated for July 16. Both Wang and Ma are KMT vice chairmen.</P>
      <P>In the ads, Wang stressed his capability to integrate the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" to win the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wang has said that the new KMT chairmen should strengthen
reforms, resolve problems within the party, such as the party's
assets and the retirement of its cadres, and integrate the "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT, People First Party and New Party in order to
present a single ticket for the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Noting that the year-end city and county elections will play a
pivotal role in determining who will win the 2008 presidential
election, Wang said the new KMT chairman should assume all the
responsibility for how the party performs in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Wang said he has been supportive of using the "pan-blue
alliance's" majority clout in the legislature and even some rational
street protests as ways to fight against what he claimed the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's frequent resorting to populism,
stressing that "special times require special measures."</P>
      <P>He stressed that he does not consider the KMT chairmanship as a
bridge to the presidency, but instead sees it as an opportunity to
help the KMT and the "pan-blue alliance" to win the 2008 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Wang on Saturday began his "around the island" tour to seek
support, with his first stops being in the counties of Tainan, Chiayi
and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>During a stop in his home county of Kaoshiung, Wang expressed
gratitude to Kaohsiung residents who mobilized some 18,000 KMT
members to endorse his registration as a candidate for the party
chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Although admitting that it is still too early to tell whether he
will win the election, Wang said that he is becoming more and more

      <P>Aboriginal Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei said
Saturday that she will leave for Japan next week to demand the
removal of tablets for a group of Taiwan aboriginal soldiers forced
to fight for the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II from a
controversial shrine for war dead in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin from the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union said she will
also demand an apology and compensation from the Japanese government
for the persecution of indigenous residents during its colonial rule
in Taiwan. She will lead a 60-member delegation made up of family
members of the deceased aboriginal soldiers.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin said it is absurd that the aboriginal soldiers, whom she
calls victims of Japanese persecution, are honored together with
their persecutors at the Yasukuni Shrine.</P>
      <P>Although the protesters will not be allowed to enter the shrine,
they will perform rites of their respective tribes outside the shrine
and sing songs to comfort the spirits of their ancestors, she said.</P>
      <P>The Yasukuni Shrine is dedicated to 2.5 million soldiers who died
fighting for Japan, including more than 28,000 from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin sued Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi two years

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) cannot cooperate with its smaller "pan-green camp" ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , then the TSU will not rule out the
possibility of asking former President Lee Teng-hui's daughter to run
for Taipei County magistrate in the year-end election.</P>
      <P>Cheng Cheng-lung, TSU secretary-general, made the remarks while
commenting on possible cooperation in the "pan-green camp" in the
year-end city and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>Cheng stressed that the party "absolutely has the sincerity to
cooperate, " but if the DPP refuses "to budge any inch," the TSU will
consider inviting Lee An-ni, daughter of the former president, who is
the spiritual leader of the TSU, to run for Taipei County magistrate.</P>
      <P>Taipei County is generally considered a big prize as the party
whose candidate wins the heavily-populated county is expected to have
a better chance of winning the presidential election in 2008. The DPP
has held the Taipei County magistracy for the last 16 years.</P>
      <P>Cheng noted that DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang and TSU Chairman Su
Chin-chiang held a meeting recently during which neither touched on
matters of substantial cooperation, but they promised to keep in
touch via hot line. The DPP also said that it would respond to the
TSU on the extent of cooperation after sorting out the matter, Cheng
added.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Su has suggested a model of cooperation for the
year-end "three-in-one elections, " namely the elections for city and
county chiefs, city and county councilors, and village and township
chiefs.</P>
      <P>Under the model, the TSU would support the DPP's candidates in
certain cities and counties, while the DPP would support the TSU
candidates for village and township chiefs, according to Su. In other
cities and counties, the DPP would support the TSU's candidates, he
added.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that the two parties could target city and county
chief, and village and township chief elections for cooperation, and
that both sides could talk about city and county chief cooperation
first.</P>
      <P>He said that the TSU has already nominated its former
Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming to run for Keelung City mayor,
while the DPP has yet to choose a candidate, and the TSU couldn't
possibly withdraw from the Keelung mayoral election.</P>
      <P>The DPP also has yet to name a candidate in Hualien County, which
is also a county where both parties could cooperate. In Tainan
County, incumbent DPP mayor Hsu Tien-tsai is seeking a new term, and
the TSU is mulling whether to put forward its own candidate.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday he
has no more personal worries now that his son has become engaged and
will soon marry.</P>
      <P>"From now on, I'll concentrate my full energy on reinvigorating
our economy and accelerating political reform, " Chen said at his
son's engagement party held in the central city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he is very pleased that his son Chen Chih-chung
will soon marry a pianist who he believes will bring music into his
family life.</P>
      <P>Chen's daughter-in-law-to-be, Huang Jui-ching, has a master's
degree in piano performance from the Taipei National University of
the Arts.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung, who obtained a master's degree in law from the
University of California at Berkeley in May, will marry his fiancee
June 18. The couple will then travel to the United States to continue
their studies.</P>
      <P>The engagement ceremony took place at Huang Jui-ching's home in
Taichung City, while the engagement party was held at Evergreen
Laurel Hotel. Most of the party guests were Huang's relatives and
family friends. Only a few political figures were invited to the
party, including Changhua County Magistrate Wong Chin-chu, Taichung
Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi and Cabinet Secretary-General Lee
Ying-yuan.</P>
      <P>Expressing his feelings about his son's marriage, President Chen
wrote in an article published in an online weekly bearing his
nickname A-bian earlier this week that he hopes his two children can
learn to adopt a business-as-usual attitude toward the limelight
shone on them due to their status as members of the first family.</P>
      <P>In the article, the president also expressed his hope that his
two children and all other local young people can learn to "be
themselves and be responsible."</P>
      <P>The president's daughter, Chen Hsing-yu, a mother of two young
sons, just obtained a master's degree from National Taiwan
University's Graduate Institute of Clinical Dentistry last Sunday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONCERNED ABOUT DELAY IN TAIWAN'S ARMS PROCUREMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has expressed a high
degree of concern over the delay in Taiwan's latest arms procurement
plan and the challenge posed by this situation to Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>During recent meetings with a group of visiting Taiwanese
journalists, most of the U.S. officials, members of Congress and
scholars raised similar questions regarding what they see as Taiwan's
inability to reach a consensus on the arms procurement plan to show
the United States its resolve to defend itself while at the same time
expecting U.S. soldiers to fight for the island in the event of an
invasion by China.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-proposed NT$480 billion arms procurement package to
buy a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, six Patriot
PAC-III anti-missile batteries and eight diesel-electric submarines
has been blocked by the opposition-controlled legislature for two
consecutive sessions.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang and People First Party have picked at
the high price tag of the procurement and the way the procurement is
budgeted.</P>
      <P>Washington officials have pointed to what they call the absurdity
of the fact that Taiwan is decreasing its annual defense spending,
which now accounts for only 2.5 percent of its gross domestic product
(GDP) , despite the rapid yearly increase in China's military
spending.</P>
      <P>The officials have also warned that the continued delay of the
procurement package might draw a negative response from the U.S.
Congress and cost Taiwan the chance to acquire the weapons.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) officials said
Saturday that all dioxin-contaminated duck eggs in Changhua County
are destroyed as soon as they are confirmed to be contaminated and
that no such eggs are circulating in the market.</P>
      <P>The officials made the reaffirmation after reports that some of
the contaminated eggs may have entered the market.</P>
      <P>Duck eggs produced in Changhua County's Hsienhsi village were
confirmed in March by National Cheng Kung University to have been
contaminated by dioxin</P>
      <P>According to COA and Department of Health (DOH) officials, they
have destroyed more than 2 million ducks and 93.34 tons of duck eggs
contaminated by dioxin since March, and have been conducting tests to
determine the source of the contamination.</P>
      <P>Huang Hung-yiao, Hsienhsi village chief, noted that the villagers
suspect that the village's approximation to the Changhua Coastal
Industrial Park may be the reason behind the duck eggs' being
contaminated with dioxin.</P>
      <P>They suspect that dust from metal products burned in the park
settles on nearby land and water and eventually makes its way into
the stomachs of the ducks.</P>
      <P>They urged the DOH to determine as soon as possible the source of
the contamination so that they won't have to live in worry any
longer.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Professor Ko Chen-en of National Taiwan
University said Saturday that Taiwan businesspeople have concentrated
on mainland China too much and that they should consider Southeast
Asia as a place to invest.</P>
      <P>Ko made the remarks while attending a seminar on the situation in
the Asia-Pacific region which was sponsored by the Thailand chapter
of the Global Alliance for Democracy and Peace.</P>
      <P>Ko noted that Taiwan businesspeople flock to the mainland mainly
because of language and geographic proximity, adding that their
investment in the mainland has exceeded US$100 billion.</P>
      <P>However, he said, the economy in Southeast Asia is developing
rapidly, and Taiwan businesspeople shouldn't overlook this point.</P>
      <P>He stressed that an international company should not only look at
language factors when considering where to expand and that Taiwan
businesspeople should not confine themselves to China and hinder
their becoming internationalized.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has been unable to join the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations because of political factors, he suggested
that Taiwan, based on its model of using the "Separate Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu" to enter the World
Trade Organization in January 2002, join a proposed common market of
the Southeast Asian countries.</P>

      <P>Residents in the central Taiwan city of
Taichung set a new Guinness world record Saturday by making 30,000
glutinous rice dumplings, known locally as "tzongtze, " in one hour.</P>
      <P>The Taichung City Government mobilized 3,000 citizens to make

ingredients wrapped in bamboo leaves, as part of Dragon Boat Festival

    <HEADLINE>WORLD VISION TAIWAN, STARBUCKS COOPERATE IN SUPPORTING ABORIGINAL KIDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 11 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In its seventh straight year of cooperation
with World Vision Taiwan (WVT) in supporting education for aboriginal
children, Starbuck Coffee has recently kicked off a three-month
charity sale at all its coffee shops around the island to raise money
to subsidize needy kids' school fees.</P>
      <P>Mugs and pen holders with the picture of an "A-nai" doll on them
are on sale at the coffee shops for the fund-raising drive. Customers
can also donate directly by placing cash in the charity fund boxes
set up at the coffee shops.</P>
      <P>The annual WVT-Starbuck charity drive was first held in 1999 with
the goal of providing disadvantaged indigenous children living in
remote mountainous areas with access to knowledge and facilities for
learning. The latest campaign, which will run through Aug. 31, aims
to raise NT$5.5 million (US$176,000) to support 1,500 needy children
living in the Jenai, Hsinyi and Hopin townships in Nantou County,
according to WVT.</P>
      <P>WVT hosted a party in Taipei on Saturday for 20 children from
Honghsiang village in Jenai Township to celebrate the Dragon Boat
Festival.</P>
      <P>A volunteer worker for the international organization, which has
been supporting disadvantaged children around the world, said that
access to the remote village has been blocked on many occassions in
recent years due to heavy downpours. The rainy season, which started
last month, has led to the closure of the only road leading into the
village for two weeks.</P>
      <P>This not only affects the transport of supplies to the
mountainous village, but also impacts key businesses, such as
tourism, resulting in economic losses to the residents of the
village. With most of the families in the village struggling just to
make enough to eat, there are few resources left over to support the
education of children, the WVT worker said.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that about half of the children in the village
come from poor or broken families that are unable to provide for
their education, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES CONDUCIVE TO POLITICAL STABILITY: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday increased
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait will be conducive to domestic
political stability and reduce risks for business people with
interests in China.</P>
      <P>Addressing a meeting of a business association in the central
city of Taichung, Hsieh said he doesn't think that increased
cross-strait exchanges would adversely affect Taiwan's separate
identity distinct from that of China.</P>
      <P>"The results of a series of public opinion polls show that more
than 60 people of the respondents identify themselves as
Taiwanese. Therefore, cross-strait civilian exchanges will not
affect Taiwan's national identity," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He also took the opportunity to clarify some misunderstandings of
the government's tax reform plans.</P>
      <P>The premier said the tax reform proposals unveiled by President
Chen Shui-bian recently will by no means lead to an across-the-board
tax hike.</P>
      <P>"The reform plan is aimed at establishing a fairer, 
healthier and more balanced taxation system," Hsieh explained.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, the proposed minimum taxation measure is
targeted at those who earn more than NT$10 million annually. At
present, many rich families could legally avoid tax payment.
Under the minimum tax scheme, high-income taxpayers will
have to pay a minimum percentage of income tax. At any rate, Hsieh
said the proposed new tax scheme is not aimed at increasing
everybody's tax burden.</P>
      <P>Touching on public order, Hsieh said the government has decided
to recruit more police officers to maintain law and order and fight
crime. With a national junior police college resuming recruiting
students this year, he said, the police manpower shortage problems
will be resolved gradually.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>About 3,000 unemployed teachers were
expected to turn out in a march Sunday to vent their frustrations
caused by their long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>Some of the marchers were expected to come from Kaohsiung and
Pingtung cities in southern Taiwan, said Chen Chun-hao, convener of
the private Saving Compulsory Education Alliance, which has collected
signatures from some 10,000 teachers islandwide in the six-day period
from June 1.</P>
      <P>The teachers, who hold official teaching licenses, but most of
whom have never had the opportunity to teach since graduating, were
to walk the streets of Taipei to demand that the Ministry of
Education face squarely the issue of licensed teachers' right to
teach, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The unemployed teachers will also ask the Ministry of Education
to consider increasing the number of teachers in elementary and
junior high schools and to implement small-class programs to create
more openings for qualified teachers, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The rally-goers will also express their opinion that elementary
school and junior high school teachers should be taxed and that the
revenues collected should be used for education; that the Ministry of
Education should promulgate standards for teachers pedagogical
performance and ethical principles so that bad teachers or those who
have constantly exhibited "uncalled for behavior or remarks" during
their careers can be replaced; and that the number of openings for
elementary school and junior high school teachers should be published
in each year's general regulations bulletin for the teacher's
examinations, Chen added.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, colleges and universities around Taiwan are
churning out qualified teachers, but with 180 graduates this year for
each opening, the number of unemployed teachers is growing.</P>
      <P>There are currently about 60,000 college graduates and masters
degree holders who have a teaching license, but fewer than 100
openings nationwide for teachers in elementary and junior high
schools this year.</P>
      <P>Since many colleges and universities in Taiwan have education and
teaching courses in their curriculums, about 18,000 individuals
qualified teach elementary or junior high matriculate each year, said
Chen, adding that the number has been snowballing for several years,
posing an increasingly serious problem in the education sector.</P>
      <P>Taking Taipei City as an example, he said, more than 1,000
licensed teachers are vying for only 30-odd openings this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH WATCHING U.S. MAD COW REPORTS CLOSELY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is watching carefully reports that
an older animal on a U.S. ranch is suspected of having mad cow
disease and that tests in Britain may take up to two weeks to confirm
the disease, a Department of Health (DOH) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Lu-hung, director of the DOH Bureau of Food Safety, said
that the suspect animal, the species of which was not disclosed and
which was first tested in November, did not enter the human food or
livestock feed supply because it was unable to walk when delivered
for slaughter.</P>
      <P>It did not have any chance of entering the Taiwan market, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>Chen noted, however, that if the animal is confirmed to have the
brain-wasting bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) , also known as
mad cow disease, Taiwan will suspend imports of U.S. beef
immediately.</P>
      <P>If that is the case, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
will have to produce epidemiological documents proving that no such
cases existing in the United States before Taiwan will reconsider
reopening its doors to U.S. beef, Chen added.</P>
      <P>U.S. beef just arrived back on the menu in Taiwan in April
after being banned for a year and a half because of the discovery of a
single case of mad cow disease in Washington State in 2003.</P>
      <P>The DOH announced in late March that Taiwan would conditionally
reopen its market to U.S. boneless beef from cattle under 30 months
old beginning April 16.</P>
      <P>Meat from U.S. cattle under 30 months old that is clear of bones,
offal and specific risk materials, including brains, trigeminal
ganglia, dorsal root ganglia and spinal marrow, and with certificates
issued by the USDA, can now be imported into Taiwan. Ground beef is
not included in the opening list, bureau officials added.</P>
      <P>The DOH Bureau of Food Safety, meanwhile, has asked the USDA to
provide Taiwan with a list of the names of legal, contracted U.S.
slaughterhouses to be used as a reference to compare with the sources
of the newly imported beef.</P>
      <P>Taiwan health and agriculture officials have traveled to the U.S.
to conduct on-site inspections of the implementation of U.S.
safeguards against mad cow disease and have recently completed the
necessary reviews for resuming the beef trade.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased US$325 million-worth of U.S. beef and beef
products in 2003 and was the sixth-largest importer of U.S. beef
before Taiwan imposed the ban in December 2003. Since then,
Australian beef has replaced U.S. beef in the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>More than 40 countries, including Japan, the largest importer,
banned U.S. beef in the aftermath of the mad cow disease scare,
seriously affecting the U.S. beef export trade, which is worth at
least US$3.8 billion a year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER CAMPAIGNS FOR KMT CHAIRMANSHIP ON KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  June  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
visited the frontline island of Kinmen Sunday and vowed to build
Kinmen into an "island of gold," using its huge potential for tourism
and direct flights with China.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while giving a speech during a ceremony to
mark the establishment of the Kinmen chapter of Wang's supporters
endorsing his bid for the chairmanship of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) through a direct vote by party members set for July
16.</P>
      <P>Saying he has an idea of opening a "Kinmen policy study center"
if he is elected KMT chairman to help push for relevant legislation
at the Legislative Yuan, Wang said that Kinmen has huge potential for
tourism and cross-Taiwan Strait transport and added that he hopes to
develop the island into a tourist resort and transit hub to help
improve its economy.</P>
      <P>Should he be elected KMT chairman, Wang went on, he will do his
best to make Kinmen a cargo and passenger transport center, turning
it into an exchange area and interaction platform for Taiwan
businessmen operating on the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Cargo transport links between Kinmen and the Chinese cities of
Xiamen, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou in nearby Fujian province should be
set up before passenger services in a blueprint for a cross-strait
transport network, according to a press release made public by Wang's
office.</P>
      <P>In efforts to implement the consensus obtained by incumbent KMT
Chairman Lien Chan during a landmark "journey of peace" to China from
April 26 to May 3, Wang firmly supports direct flights between Kinmen
and Fujian so as to attract Chinese tourists to Taiwan and help
Taiwan farm produce to be sold in China, the press release said.</P>
      <P>Kinmen has maintained shipping services with Xiamen since the
beginning of 2001, commonly known as the "mini three links" that also
sees ferry links between the Taiwan-controlled island of Matsu and
the port of Mawei in Fujian.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Chih-kang, a former minister of economic affairs
who serves as the chief delegate in Wang's campaign team, claimed
that Wang's chairmanship will help the KMT boost its chances in the
2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-kang called on the KMT members to back Wang on the
grounds that it is "necessary" to vote for Wang for the sake of the
KMT and the 2008 presidential race to secure the maximum interests of
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Wang will follow Lien's anti-independence line in
terms of cross-strait relations, Wang Chih-kang said that the KMT
needs Wang to help resolve the many problems facing the party, adding
that "helping the KMT win is to help the ROC win."</P>
      <P>The legislative speaker ran a prominent ad in print media
Saturday soliciting support from KMT members and describing himself
as the "right person" to lead the KMT at a juncture when the party
has to consolidate the "pan blue alliance" to counter the "pan green
camp" in December's city mayo and county chief elections.
</P>
      <P>Wang is set to compete against Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou in the
KMT chairmanship election. Both Wang and Ma are party vice chairmen.</P>
      <P>Wang said Saturday in his native Kaohsiung County in an
endorsement campaign that he is confident of winning the election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL PARTIES AT ODDS OVER EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  12  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The four political parties in the
Legislative Yuan were at odds Sunday over whether the Legislative
Yuan should gather for an extraordinary session to work on bills
considered urgent by the government.</P>
      <P>Legislator William Lai, the legislative whip of ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , said he hopes the legislature will gather
for an extra session after the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has
chosen its new chairman July 16.</P>
      <P>Citing a special budget for arms purchases and the confirmation
of the president's nominees for members of the Control Yuan as
examples, Lai said several bills and proposed revisions to some
existing laws are urgently needed by the Executive Yuan and have to
be enacted immediately.</P>
      <P>Lai said his caucus will move before July 16 for an extra
legislative session after July 16 and he expressed hope that
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who is running for the KMT
chairmanship, will convene inter-party negotiations to decide the
exact date.</P>
      <P>His opinion was supported by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU), which is a political ally of the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Shih-cho, the TSU deputy convener at the
Legislative Yuan, said the just-concluded session that ran from
February to May enacted 46 bills, which is the lowest number since
1999 and has seriously hindered the administration's agenda.</P>
      <P>In order to address the problem, Huang said, an extra legislative
session is needed, with the bills to be debated not necessarily
limited to the budget for arms purchase and the confirmation of the
Control Yuan nominees.</P>
      <P>The KMT and its political ally the People First Party (PFP) ,
however, do not see the necessity for any extra legislative meeting.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, the KMT whip at the legislature,
said his party believes an extraordinary session should be called
only for dealing with constitutional issues, of which none are
pending in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Ordinary bills can be dealt with during regular sessions, Tseng
said.</P>
      <P>The PFP concurred with the KMT, with its legislative convener,
Legislator Chen Chih-ping, claiming that the arms purchase has
already been rejected by voters in a national referendum March 20,
2004. He added that he does not see any urgency which would require
the legislature to deal with it during an extra session.</P>
      <P>As to the president's nominees for the Control Yuan, Tseng went
on, their names were presented to the previous legislature that was
dissolved when the terms of its members ended in January.</P>
      <P>The current legislature has not been asked by the president to
confirm his nominees for the Control Yuan, so the legislature is not
in a position to exercise its right to approve these nominees,
whether or not there is an extra session.</P>
      <P>The president presented his 29 nominees to the legislature in
December 2004 but was asked to withdraw the list on the grounds that
some of those nominated did not live up to public expectations.</P>
      <P>The president refused to retract his list and the legislature
refused to act on it. The political impasse continued after the new
legislature gathered for its first session in February and has made
the Control Yuan be without members after the terms of its original
members expired at the end of January.</P>

      <P>An armed forces' psychological warfare
drill week is scheduled to kick off Monday to help the military
better understand the threats from enemies and allow the armed forces
to know more about modern warfare and strengthen their ability to
discern China's non-military warfare.</P>
      <P>The psychological warfare week, primarily to be conducted via

    <TEXT>
      <P>About 1,800 unemployed teachers turned out
in a march Sunday to vent their frustrations caused by their
long-term unemployment, according to Ministry of Education (MOE)
officials.</P>
      <P>The teachers, who hold official teaching licenses but most of
whom have never had the opportunity to teach since graduating, walked
the streets of Taipei to demand that the Ministry of Education face
squarely the issue of licensed teachers' right to teach.</P>
      <P>They made a six-point appeal and demanded that the Education
Ministry deliver on them, including that the MOE should consider
increasing the number of teachers in elementary and junior high
schools; that the MOE should implement small-class programs to create
more openings for qualified teachers; that the number of professional
teachers trained should be cut at least by 50 percent on a yearly
basis; that elementary school and junior high school teachers should
be taxed; that the MOE should promulgate pedagogical standards for
teachers and ethical principles to regulate bad teachers; and that
the number of openings for elementary school and junior high school
teachers should be published in each year's general regulations
bulletin for the teacher's examinations.</P>
      <P>Responding to the teachers' requests, Chen Yi-hsing, director of
the MOE Department of Secondary Education, said the ministry will see
to it that the number of professional teachers trained each year will
be reduced by 51.2 percent in three years.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, stressed that the ministry's determination to
maintain a diverse source of teacher cultivation will not change.</P>
      <P>Dissatisfied with Chen's response, the marchers gave the MOE
three days to provide a response they like better. Otherwise, they
said, more unemployed teachers will be mobilized to launch a sit-in
in front of the MOE.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chun-hao, convener of the private Saving
Compulsory Education Alliance, colleges and universities around
Taiwan are churning out qualified teachers, but with 180 graduates
this year for each opening, the number of unemployed teachers is
growing.</P>
      <P>There are currently about 60,000 college graduates and masters

qualified teach elementary or junior high matriculate each year, said
Chen, adding that the number has been snowballing for several years,
posing an increasingly serious problem in the education sector.</P>
      <P>Taking Taipei City as an example, he said, more than 1,000
licensed teachers are vying for only 30-odd openings this year.</P>
      <P>In response to the teachers' rally, William Lai, a convener of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party at the Legislative Yuan, said
that the teachers' appeal is "constructive" and he called for the MOE
to respond favorably.</P>
      <P>Lai said taxing elementary school and junior high school teachers
would enlarge the base on which the government can impose more taxes
and it is also a policy for which the Executive Yuan is planning.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators' demand that the MOE should promulgate
standards for teachers so that bad teachers or those who have
constantly exhibited "uncalled for behavior or remarks" during their
careers can be replaced is also commendable, Lai said, adding that by
doing so, the standards of the country's teachers can be raised.</P>

      <P>An expert called on the government Sunday
to work out a law to protect sensitive technology.</P>

S. protection, underlining the U. S. notion of "residual security
value."</P>
      <P>Gary Schmitt, executive director of the Project for a New
American Century, pointed out that they have found the
procrastination over the procurement bill in Taiwan's parliament is a
result of domestic political wrangling.</P>
      <P>For instance, Schmitt said, the opposition People First Party
(PFP) has vowed to block the bill at the legislature unless President
Chen Shui-bian apologizes for an allegation against PFP Chairman
James Soong</P>
      <P>Soong sued Chen June 4 for defamation after Chen alleged that the
PFP chairman had met Chen Yunlin -- director of the Taiwan Affairs
Office under Beijing's State Council -- in the U. S. to seek
permission for a visit to China in early May.</P>
      <P>Adequate screening by the parliament is necessary, but such a
boycott is rather a product of political strife, Schmitt said.</P>
      <P>Dan Blumenthal, a researcher at the American Enterprise
Institute, described the Kuomintang's (KMT's) opposition to the arms
purchase bill as "absurd, " pointing out that the party was very
supportive of such bills when it was Taiwan's ruling party.</P>
      <P>The KMT's turnaround in attitude toward the issue is very
cynical, Blumenthal said, noting that such a change only represents
the KMT's hostility toward Chen and that it is something in which a
responsible opposition party would not engage.</P>
      <P>Richard D'amato, chairman of the U. S.- China Economic and
Security Review Commission, and John J. Tkacik, Jr., a senior
researcher at the Heritage Foundation, contended that the U. S. is
not expected to take countermeasures against Taiwan, despite the 
bill's failure to clear the legislature.</P>
      <P>But they expressed the view that Taiwan must stage a firm
determination to safeguard itself before turning to the U. S. for
help.</P>
      <P>Some U. S. government officials have warned that Taiwan might
lose the opportunity to purchase the weapons if it continues to
remain indecisive, now that some other countries have emerged as
potential buyers for the equipment in question.</P>
      <P>If the issue remains unresolved in the coming months, it might
upset support for Taiwan within the U. S. Congress, the officials
said, arguing that Taiwan's decreased military spending -- only about
2.5 percent of its GDP (gross domestic product) -- is extremely low
compared to China's continued military expansion.</P>
      <P>Randall G. Schriver, a former U. S. deputy assistant secretary of
state, said that the U. S. is not very likely to rescind its approval
for selling the weapons to Taiwan, but he urged the Taiwan
authorities to view the matter more practically, such as the
possibility that production lines might close.</P>
      <P>In view of the grave concern from the U. S., the Executive Yuan
has called on the Legislative Yuan to open an extraordinary session
in July to exclusively screen the major military procurement bill,
stalled during the last two legislative sessions and now valued at
NT$480 billion (US$15.4 billion) after being cut by the opposition
camp from its original estimate of NT$610.8 billion.</P>

modern warfare and strengthen their ability to discern China's
non-military warfare.</P>
      <P>The psychological warfare week, primarily to be conducted via

military intelligence security; boosting patriotic morale; and
streamlining military discipline, said Wang Ming-wuo, a section chief
with the General Political Warfare Bureau (GPWB) under the Ministry
of National Defense.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 60 indigenous people from Taiwan, led
by aboriginal Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei, departed Monday for Japan
to demand the removal of tablets for a group of Taiwan aboriginal
soldiers forced to fight for the Japanese Imperial Army during World
War II from a controversial shrine for war dead in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin's group is made up of 60 Taiwan indigenous residents who
are offspring or family members of the deceased aboriginal soldiers,
known as the Taiwanese Kaosha Warriors Group.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin, who is from the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, said
that while in Japan, her group will also demand an apology and
compensation from the Japanese government for the persecution of
indigenous residents during its colonial rule in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The legislator said it is absurd that the aboriginal soldiers,
whom she calls victims of Japanese persecution, are honored together
with their persecutors at the Yasukuni Shrine.</P>
      <P>Although the protesters will not be allowed to enter the shrine,
they will perform rites of their respective tribes outside the shrine
and sing aboriginal songs to comfort the spirits of their ancestors,
she said.</P>
      <P>The Yasukuni Shrine is dedicated to 2.5 million soldiers who died
fighting for Japan, including more than 28,000 from Taiwan and 1,068
convicted war criminals.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin sued Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi two years
ago for violating Japan's constitution by paying a visit to the
shrine, but the suit was rejected by an Osaka district court. Kao
Chin later appealed, and the high court of Osaka is expected to
announce its ruling on the appeal June 17. The ruling will be final
as no further appeals are allowed according to Japanese law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMIA SINICA FORECASTS TAIWAN'S 2005 GDP GROWTH AT 3.74%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica researchers forecast Monday
that Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by 3.74 percent
for 2005, lower than the 4.05 percent figure that was previously
predicted for the year.</P>
      <P>Researchers from Academia Sinica's Institute of Economics said
that Taiwan's economic performance for the first half of this year
will not be as brilliant as previously predicted mainly as a result
of high crude oil prices and the rapid appreciation of Taiwan's
currency against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Wu Chung-shu, one of the institute's researchers, said that the
global economy has turned sluggish since the last quarter of 2004
mainly as a result of rising bank interest rates. At the same time,
he said, crude oil prices have not declined to reflect the slowing
economy, creating a further drag on economic growth.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports of goods and services rose by only 1.23 percent
in the first quarter due to the double pressures of a stagnant world
economy and an appreciating New Taiwan dollar against the greenback,
Wu said, adding that GDP growth for Q1 was consequently only 2.54
percent.</P>
      <P>Wu forecast that this flagging trend will continue into the third
quarter before things start to turn around. GDP growth is expected to
hit 4.83 percent for Q3 and 5.05 percent for Q4, for a growth of 3.74
percent for the whole of 2005, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PINEAPPLES HIT MACAU MARKET IN RECORD TIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Macau,   June  13  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A shipment of fresh, mature Taiwan
pineapples was delivered to Macau Monday in a record-breaking 13
hours, trade sources reported.</P>
      <P>It took only 13 hours to allow fresh and tasty pineapples to be
put on a Taiwan Agricultural Products Exposition table in Macau
around 9 a.m. Monday after farmers in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan
began to pick and pack the fruit around 8 p.m. Sunday upon receiving
a telephone order from the Macau expo authorities, said Wu
Wen-hsiung, vice president of the Taipei-based China Times Evening
News, one of the private organizations co-sponsoring the expo.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan Agricultural Products Expo authorities in
Macau, the Taiwan pineapples on display were all sold out on the
first day of the expo Sunday. They placed another order with the
Chiayi pineapple farmers around 4 p.m. the same day in the hope that
a new shipment could make it when the expo reopened the next day at 9
a.m.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi farmers did not fail them -- they began to pick and
pack the pineapples around 8 p.m. Sunday and delivered the cartons at
4 a.m. Sunday, enabling the shipment to reach the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport at 7 a.m. the same morning.</P>
      <P>The transportation companies as well as the Macau customs
authorities have also been cooperative -- the pineapples were flown
over the Taiwan Strait and passed Macau's customs and quarantine
checks to hit the expo table in two hours, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Normal transportation of agricultural products from Taiwan to
Macau takes at least 20 hours if the products are transported by air.
It usually takes three to seven days if the shipments are delivered
by sea, Wu added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POPULATION WHITE PAPER HAS YET TO BE FLESHED OUT: MOI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has yet
to flesh out a white paper on the government's future population
policy, a ministry official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Su Ching-chao, deputy director of the MOI's Population
Administration Department, was responding to a newspaper report that
the government will offer tax incentives to encourage childbirth,
including offering tax deductions for children born out of wedlock.</P>
      <P>According to the media report, the decision was made during an
interministerial meeting called by the MOI last week.</P>
      <P>Su said the MOI indeed invited officials from the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) and other relevant
government agencies as well as representatives of private
associations to discuss the contents of a proposed white paper on
population policy last Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The meeting focused discussions on general policy directions
regarding population quality, number and distribution and has yet to
touch on specific measures for encouraging childbirth," Su said.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that the meeting was held with a view to
addressing worsening population trends, including declining birth
rates and a greying population.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Su said, no consensus has yet been reached on any
specific measures.</P>
      <P>"The media report about an initial consensus on offering tax
deductions for children born to unmarried women was not correct, " Su
said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the MOI is still working on the contents of the
population white paper and will do its utmost to finalize a package
of population policy guidelines as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to the media report, some government officials voiced
support at the June 9 meeting for the proposed tax deductions for
children born out of wedlock. They said the measure probably could
encourage women unwilling to marry but willing to have children to go
ahead and do so, thereby helping increase Taiwan's birth rate.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the MOI show that the number of Taiwan
adults who have never been married is approaching 25 percent of the
total population.</P>
      <P>A study released by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) also showed that more than 50 percent of local
women aged between 25 and 29 remained unmarried last year and that
the ratio of local women responding to a DGBAS survey who said they
would not have children has increased to 2.45 percent from 1.2
percent recorded in a previous survey.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the Department of Health said the
number of fetuses aborted annually in Taiwan has been estimated at
280,000 to 300,000, with more than half of these belonging to
unmarried women.</P>
      <P>Some MOI officials said the proposed tax deductions for children
born to unmarried women are not aimed at encouraging childbirth out
of wedlock. The proposed measure could only serve as part of the
efforts to raise the birth rate, the officials said, adding that many
other measures are needed to realize that goal.</P>
      <P>According to the media report, other measures to be adopted to
encourage local married couples to have children will include
improving in vitro reproductive technology to help infertile married
couples have children and offering tax exemptions for underage
children and providing better day care and welfare services for
working mothers.</P>

President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo appealed
yesterday for unity as she vowed to use her powers to

end to 'dirty politics' 

PRESIDENT Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo called for an
end to "dirty politics" but avoided mention of "The

"jueteng" within a year's time but made no reference
to relatives allegedly mired in it.

The Philippine Star: Susan: ISAFP wiretapper

One of the military intelligence agents suspended
last week for supposed "high profile" wiretapping was

    <TEXT>
      <P>Torrential rains in Taiwan's southern areas
over the past few days have caused heavy agricultural damage, with
the latest official tallies showing that as of 11: 00 a.m. Monday, a
total of NT$26.38 million (US$840,500) in agricultural losses has
been reported.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County has suffered the most, with NT$17.2 million
worth of agricultural losses, according to the Council of Agriculture
(COA) tallies. The council also reported that leafy vegetables and
melons have born the brunt of the devastation.</P>
      <P>An estimated 493 hectares of crop fields have been flooded as a
result of the torrential rains, with 38 percent of these fields
having there crops completely destroyed, according to the COA.</P>
      <P>After Kaohsiung County, Pingtung County has suffered the most in
terms of agricultural losses, at NT$3.97 million, followed by Tainan
City, at NT$2.77 million, and Tainan County, at NT$2.44 million, the
COA tallies showed.</P>
      <P>However, despite the heavy agricultural losses, the supply of
fruits and vegetables to wholesale markets in Taipei has not been
significantly affected as these markets are mainly supplied by
producers in Changhua, Yunlin and Chiayi.</P>
      <P>These counties have not been seriously affected by the recent
torrential rains, the officials noted, adding however that prices in
the markets could move up in the near future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in anticipation of continuing torrential rains, the
COA Soil and Water Conservation Bureau on Monday issued a red alert
against possible landslides and mudflows for 40 creeks in Pingtung,
Tainan and Kaohsiung counties that are vulnerable to flooding.</P>
      <P>Thirty-six of the creeks are located in 24 villages in eight
townships in Pingtung. Under the red alert, local authorities have
the power to forcibly evacuate residents living near the creeks in
certain situations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRIVATE CONSUMPTION, INVESTMENT TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND: RESEARCHER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Consumption and investment in Taiwan's
private sector are both expected to expand throughout this year
despite a slowing in the overall economic growth in Taiwan, an
Academia Sinica researcher forecast Monday.</P>
      <P>Private consumption and investments are expected to expand by
3.26 percent and 17.47 percent, respectively, in 2005 over the 2004
levels, thanks to the brisk domestic real estate market, which has
gained momentum since late last year, and the improved unemployment
situation, said Wu Chung-shu, a researcher with Academia Sinica's
Institute of Economics.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's economic performance for the first half of
this year will not be as brilliant as previously predicted mainly as
a result of high crude oil prices and the rapid appreciation of
Taiwan's currency against the U.S. dollar, Wu said that Taiwan's
gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by 3.74 percent for 2005,
lower than the 4.05 percent figure that was previously predicted for
the year.</P>
      <P>Government investment, one of the factors making up the GDP
figure, totaled NT$372 billion (US$12 billion) in 2005, marking a
paltry annual growth of 0.69 percent over the year-earlier level
because many of the major development projects that the government
had announced would be carried out islandwide have not begun yet, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>However, Wu noted, the booming real estate market and lower
unemployment rate should jump-start consumption growth in the private
sector.</P>
      <P>Private investment, meanwhile, should also pick up steam this
year, hopefully up by 17.47 percent, to continue the dynamic rise
from last year, when private investment posted a whopping annual
growth of 28.2 percent, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu forecast, Taiwan's exports of goods and services
will grow about 5.04 percent this year, down noticeably from last
year's 15.27 percent as a result of the double pressures of a
flagging world economy and an appreciating New Taiwan dollar against
the greenback.</P>
      <P>The annual growth of Taiwan's imports of goods and services are
also seen to slow down this year, down from last year's 18.56 percent
to 6.71 percent, Wu forecast.</P>
      <P>The global economy has turned sluggish since the last quarter of
2004 mainly as a result of rising bank interest rates. At the same
time, he said, crude oil prices have not declined to reflect the
slowing economy, creating a further drag on economic growth.</P>
      <P>Wu forecast that this flagging trend will continue into the third
quarter before things start to turn around. GDP growth is expected to
hit 4.83 percent for Q3 and 5.05 percent for Q4, for a growth of 3.74
percent for the whole of 2005, he said.</P>
      <P>How Taiwan's economy will fare in the following months will be
directly impacted by several factors, including crude oil and raw
materials' prices on the international markets; exchange rates among
the greenback, the NT dollar and the Chinese renminbi; the
development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations and the fluctuation of
bank interests rates at home and abroad, Wu concluded.</P>

      <P>Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng said
Monday that the issue of jobless teachers will be sorted out taking
economics into account.</P>
      <P>Tu made the remarks while inspecting dilapidated school buildings
at a Kaohsiung elementary school in southern Taiwan, one day after
more than 2,000 jobless teachers assembled in a street protest to ask
that the Ministry of Education raise the ratio of teachers to
students, and cut the number of students in a class to allow more
employment opportunities for them.</P>
      <P>Tu said that those who protested were intern teachers, and that
their unemployment has structural problems.</P>
      <P>He noted that currently, the number of students in elementary and
junior high schools is decreasing, and that the supply and demand

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday he hopes
that the Legislative Yuan will prioritize the bill for an eight-year,
NT$80 billion ( US$2.539 billion) flood-control project if it
convenes an extra session next month.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks while attending the annual conference of
the Chinese Institute of Engineers. He was referring specifically to
his just-concluded tour of southern Taiwan a day earlier to see first
hand the damage brought about in recent days by flash flooding.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who was Kaohsiung mayor before assuming the post of
premier this February, said that southern Taiwan has been plagued by
flooding for more than 10 years and the government is sympathetic to
the plight of the people.</P>
      <P>The problem can be solved, the premier said, noting that some
parts of Kaohsiung used to be inundated three or four times a year,
but after the installment of flood-control ponds, no more flooding
was reported.</P>
      <P>Currently, a lot of areas in Taiwan still are inundated whenever
there are downpours, Hsieh said, adding that under the proposed NT$80
billion flood-control project, flooding problems in population-dense
areas could be resolved in the first two years.</P>
      <P>The premier also mapped out the policy of his government based on
an "equilateral triangle" theory, with the top angle being economic
development, and social justice and ecological sustainability
occupying the other two sides, saying that the government's budget
will take into consideration economic development and upgrading the
quality of life.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-JAPAN FISHERY TALKS DUE IN LATE JUNE, EARLY JULY: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan are expected to hold talks
in about half a month to address their recent fishery disputes in the
overlapping water of the two countries' exclusive economic zones, an
official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Gary Lin Sung-huann, director-general of MOFA's East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, said that Japan has responded to the ministry's
request to conduct bilateral negotiations to settle the dispute as
soon as possible by agreeing to hold the talks in late June or early
July.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, MOFA has set the fishery negotiations as the
top issue in its dealings with Japan, and the Executive Yuan will
call an inter-ministerial meeting later the same day to discuss the
issue.</P>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) held a seminar in the
morning at the Legislative Yuan, with fishermen and officials from
MOFA and the Ministry of National Defense (MND) taking part.</P>
      <P>Sha Chih-i, deputy director of the Fisheries Administration under
the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, said that Taiwan will
emulate the China-Japan and Japan-South Korea models to conduct the
negotiations with Japan. 
</P>
      <P>To meet the precondition not to affect future demarcation of each
other's economic zones, Taiwan will discuss with Japan on first
drawing up a joint operations area in the disputed water where
fishing boats from the two countries are allowed to catch fish under
adequate management.</P>
      <P>Nearly 50 fishing boats from Suao, in the eastern Taiwan county
of Ilan, staged a protest last Friday in water 86 nautical miles off
Taiwan's northeastern coast against Japanese patrol vessels that had
expelled Taiwan fishing ships out of an area in which the
200-nautical mile exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan
overlap.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-pin, a PFP caucus whip at the Legislative Yuan, accused
the MND of negligence for having not dispatched vessels to protect
the Taiwan fishermen and for trying to pass the buck to the Coast
Guard Administration (CGA).</P>
      <P>Chen opined that the Ministry of the Interior and the Fisheries
Administration should allocate funds in national compensation to
those Taiwan fishing boats that were dispersed or detained by Japan
due to the government's inability to protect its nationals.</P>
      <P>An MND official defended the ministry's stance by clarifying that
the CGA is the government agency that is designated to deal with such
incidents and that the MND will offer assistance when the CGA needs
help.</P>
      <P>Fishermen attending the seminar were angry with the government's
poor handling of the issue, claiming that if the government fails to
do them justice within 15 days, they will converge fishing boats from
across Taiwan to encircle Japanese patrol vessels and stage a protest
before the Interchange Association in Taipei -- Japan's
representative office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fishing ships have been repeatedly expelled or arrested by
Japanese patrol vessels over the past two years after Japan
readjusted and expanded its exclusive economic zone to as close as
some 20 nautical miles off the coasts of Ilan and neighboring Hualien
counties.</P>
      <P>According to a Fisheries Administration official who commented
over the weekend, Taiwan and Japan will seek to resolve their fishing
disputes through dialogue in line with international law after the
government filed a strong protest to Japan.</P>
      <P>Before the talks start and during the negotiation process, Taiwan
fishermen will be asked to operate within an area temporarily
demarcated by the government and the CGA will send patrol ships to
fully protect them, the official said.</P>
      <P>For the time being, Taiwan and Japan have reached consensus in
designating a joint operations and conservation area in the disputed
waters for fishing boats of both sides, but the two countries remain
divided on the issue regarding joint management, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan have unsuccessfully had 14 rounds of talks in
the hope of settling the dispute since 1996.</P>

A U.S. Congressionally mandated panel will report this week that
the United Nations suffers from poor management, " dismal" staff
morale and lack of accountability and professional ethics but will
acknowledge the broad changes proposed for the organization by
Secretary General Kofi Annan and urge the United States to support

Wall Street Journal: With Italy in the Doldrums, Many Point
Fingers at the Euro.

Many manufacturers across Italy say the Euro's sharp rise against
the dollar inflated the price of their products and made them
defenseless against Asian rivals. In the past, Italy would devalue
its old currency, the lira, to help businesspeople claw back to
competitiveness against other countries. But since Rome gave up
control of currency policy to join the Euro in 1999, manufacturers
have watched their fortunes slide. Having the Euro Six years ago, 11
European nations made a bold bet that a common currency would unify
and fortify the continent from Sicily to Helsinki. Now, as many of
the nations in what is known as the Euro zone slog through an
economic funk, the experiment is helping to drive countries further
apart -- and fueling a growing resentment of the wider European
Union.</TEXT>

      <P>Among the three candidates for the
leadership of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region of China,
civil service veteran Donald Tsang has gained the support of 78
percent of polled citizens, leaving the other two far behind,
according to the poll results released Monday by Hong Kong
University.</P>
      <P>In the survey, conducted last week among more than 1,000
citizens, only 3 percent gave their support to opposition Democratic
Party leader Lee Wing-tat, while less than 1 percent tipped lawmaker
Chim Pui-chung as their choice, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that 63 percent of the respondents said
they do not want Chim elected as chief executive, while 51 percent
voted against Lee. Only 4 percent of the respondents did not favor
Tsang, who is now the acting chief executive.</P>
      <P>Among Tsang's supporters, however, only 9 percent said they know
Tsang's campaign ideas well, while 34 percent said they have little
knowledge of his political ideas and plans and other 29 percent said
they only know a little about Tsang's ideas.</P>
      <P>According to a survey researcher, the figures show that Tsang won
the largest popularity for his administrative performance rather than

    <HEADLINE>DOH TO REINSTATE BAN ON U.S. BEEF IF BSE CONFIRMED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will
reinstate a ban on U.S. beef imports if the United States confirms it
has found a new case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) , or
mad cow disease, a food sanitation official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Lu-hung, director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation,
made the announcement while attending a news conference jointly
organized by a group of lawmakers from across the political spectrum.</P>
      <P>During the news conference, lawmakers from both ruling and
opposition parties urged the DOH to immediately reinstate a ban on
U.S. beef imports that was lifted barely two months ago.</P>
      <P>When the DOH lifted the U.S. beef import ban April 16, Chen said,
it set a condition that allows for an immediate halt of further
imports if a new case of BSE is found.</P>
      <P>"The United States has sent samples to Britain for further
testing. If the results are positive, we will immediately suspend
U.S. beef imports," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all
related products in December 2003 after the discovery in Washington
State of a single BSE case.</P>
      <P>On April 16, Taiwan began to allow imports of U.S. boneless beef
from animals under 30 months of age.</P>
      <P>Quoting data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) ,
Chen said boneless beef, particularly that from young cattle, is no
longer capable of spreading BSE due to improvements in feed and
slaughtering methods.</P>
      <P>Chen said the World Organization for Animal Health has stipulated
that "boneless beef with no other specific dangerous substances" from
animals under 30 months of age can be exported even from BSE-infected
areas.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said the DOH is determined to reinstate the
U.S. beef import ban if the new case is confirmed as BSE.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Consumers' Foundation urged local people not to
buy U.S. beef for the time being.</P>
      <P>Jason Lee, chairman of the foundation, said he shares lawmakers'
views that the DOH should immediately ban U.S. beef imports. He also
advised local consumers to refrain from purchasing U.S. beef until
after the British testing proves that the suspected case is not BSE.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMED FORCES INSTRUCTED TO MAINTAIN GUARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Defense Minister Lee Jye instruct
the armed forces Monday to maintain their guard and strengthen their
will to fight, saying that China now possesses a more resilient
"two-pronged" strategy against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee gave the pep-talk in a written statement as an armed forces'
psychological warfare drill week kicked off.</P>
      <P>He noted that Beijing has heightened its military intimidation of
Taiwan through the enactment of its Anti-secession Law March 14,
which codifies the use of force should the island move toward formal
independence.</P>
      <P>But Beijing has also on other hand tried to create an ambience of
peace through cross-Taiwan Strait private exchanges, showing that its
"double-handed" strategy has become ever more resilient and flexible,
Lee added.</P>
      <P>He said that since Beijing has broached its warfare on Taiwan on
three fronts -- legal, media and psychological -- more than one year
ago, it has continued to use one or another approach.</P>
      <P>Beijing has hoped that this "soft" offensive will undermine the
morale of the Taiwan public and drive a wedge into a "unified"
Taiwan, he said, pointing out that the armed forces and the public
must remain vigilant against China's united front strategy and must
realize the true colors behind what he described as a "charm
offensive."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Beijing has been promoting military buildup
in terms of quality, quantity and high-tech enhancement and that it
has consistently strengthened its military deployment targeting
Taiwan along its southeast coastal areas.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the armed forces should not be fooled by the
surface goodwill from the other side and relax its vigilance, as that
would put a crack in national security and cause the government to
lose its bargaining chips to counter or negotiate.</P>
      <P>He also said that the Hankuang No. 21 drill recently completed
its computer simulation exercise and reached several consensuses,
including that the nucleus of defending Taiwan should be to upgrade
its self-defense capability.</P>
      <P>He said the ministry is planning to buy advanced weaponry and to
step up its military buildup, because upgraded military personnel
will need more advanced weaponry systems.
</P>
      <P>The psychological warfare week, the first in Taiwan in seven
years, will also for the first time introduce China's "armed conflict
law" to allow Republic of China military personnel to gain a better
understanding of the war strategies and combat methods of the
People's Liberation Army.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOUTHERN TAIWAN RAVAGED BY TORRENTIAL RAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three days of torrential rain brought by a
cold front have flooded low-lying areas in southern Taiwan, ravaging
agriculture and bringing highway and rail traffic in some areas to a
standstill.</P>
      <P>In Machia rural township in the southernmost county of Pingtung,
818 mm of precipitation was recorded in the previous 24 hours,
according to meteorologists Monday.</P>
      <P>As a result, much of that county has been inundated and bridges
on many rivers have been closed as water levels reached dangerous
heights.</P>
      <P>Agricultural authorities said the rain has caused damage worth
about NT$171 million (US$5.46 million) to agriculture in southern
Taiwan, especially in Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Tainan counties.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture said the damage suffered by farmers
growing sesame, watermelon and leafy vegetables in Tainan is so
serious that some farmers there are eligible for government cash
relief, while the other farmers in the three counties can apply for
soft loans provided by the government.</P>
      <P>The council is also asking farmer's associations to market
stockpiled refrigerated vegetables to prevent shortages of vegetables
on the market.</P>
      <P>Many fish farms and livestock farms in the three counties have
been completely washed away by the flooding.</P>
      <P>The rain has caused landslides in mountainous areas, disrupting
traffics on the southern cross-island highway.</P>
      <P>Rail traffic between Taitung and Kaohsiung was disrupted briefly
Monday morning after the water under the Linbian Bridge in Pingtung
County surged beyond dangerous levels. The railway reopened that
afternoon when the water in the river receded a little.</P>
      <P>A total of 49 schools in the three counties have suffered damage
in the flooding and four people have been reported killed in the
flooding, including one washed away by water in Kaohsiung and three
others killed in flood-related accidents -- two in Pingtung and one
in Tainan.</P>
      <P>In order to cope with the unexpected rain, the Central Disaster
Prevention and Relief Center has been opened to coordinate relief
operations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the front is not expected to move out of Taiwan
before June 18, weather forecasters warned the public to be on guard
against the torrential rain until then.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MORE FLEXIBLE IN DEALINGS WITH TAIWAN, BUT HARDER ON STANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, observers
said Monday, China seems to have adopted a softened approach toward
Taiwan, although the Beijing leadership led by President Hu Jintao
has shown little flexibility in its stance toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-ueh, a professor at Tamkang University specializing in
China affairs, said that the current Beijing leadership differs a lot
from its predecessors in its decision-making and strategic deployment
in its dealings with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Beijing is using a two-pronged strategy
centered on its "one China" principle and the so-called "1992
consensus" to deal with Taiwan's ruling and opposition camps after
last December's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The win by the pro-unification "pan blue alliance" of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) over the
pro-independence "pan green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union by grabbing
more than half of the seats in the Legislative Yuan led to the
changes, Chang pointed out.</P>
      <P>On one side, Beijing seeks to build a friendly atmosphere in its
exchanges with Taiwan by inviting opposition leaders -- KMT Chairman
Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong -- to visit China in late
April and early May and by holding bilateral talks on the special
charter flights over the Chinese new year holiday for Taiwan
businessmen working in China, he said.</P>
      <P>On the other side, it came up with its Anti-Secession Law in
March, threatening to use "non-peaceful means" to contain Taiwan, he
noted.</P>
      <P>At a time when Taiwan and the entire world was lashing out at
Beijing for the Anti-Secession Law, Hu's meetings with Lien and Soong
successfully shifted the global attention from Beijing's hegemonic
attitude to wide speculation over a possible new breakthrough in
Taiwan-China relations, leading the outside world to ponder on Hu's
strategy toward Taiwan, according to analysts.</P>
      <P>Although some people think it is Hu who took the initiative to
improve China's relations with Taiwan -- daring to show greater
flexibility following so many years of up-and-down in bilateral ties
-- the analysts said that Hu stands by his principles.</P>
      <P>Randall G. Schriver, a former U. S. deputy assistant secretary of
state, recently told a visiting group of journalists from Taiwan that
China has increasingly got to know of the aggressive competition
among Taiwan's political parties and that Hu is also quite good at
using the situation to set traps to gain advantages in political
moves against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the same time, many watchers are of the view that Beijing is
also fully aware of the fact that its rival is the governing DPP and
that it needs to deal with it.</P>
      <P>But due to the political divergences between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait and a lack of mutual trust, Beijing has only been able
to try to forge an atmosphere conducive to rekindling substantive
talks with Taiwan for the time being, watchers said.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chih-chia, a professor at Ming Chuang University, contended
that a compromise by the two sides over "one China" and the "1992
consensus" disputes will be the key to reopening two-way talks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES EARLY CONSULTATION ON TOURISTS FROM CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh urged China Monday to
respond with goodwill and negotiate with Taiwan as soon as possible
on matters concerning Chinese tourists coming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while elaborating on the
government's stance on opening the country to tourists from China to
more than 100 Taiwan businessmen operating in China at a dinner
party held in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that the government announced a plan to allow Chinese
people to visit Taiwan as tourists in November 2001, but as China has
yet to list Taiwan as a destination for tourism, the number of such
tourists coming to Taiwan amounted to only 44,500.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the arrival of Chinese tourists also highlighted
problems such as groups of "tourists" disappearing en masse upon
arriving in Taiwan in July and August last year, he added.</P>
      <P>To allow more Chinese tourists to have high quality trips to
Taiwan, the Executive Yuan has, under the premise of effective
management, studied the establishment of a passenger personal
guarantee system and renewed regulations for travel agents so as to
upgrade management efficiency.</P>
      <P>The premier said Taiwan hopes that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait can consult on such matters as identity verification,
repatriation for overstayers, cooperation and regulations for
cross-strait travel agents, and mediation of travel disputes.</P>
      <P>He said the Executive Yuan has instructed the Mainland Affairs
Council, as well as the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, to work out plans for consultation and to arrange for
bilateral talks in the hope that China will respond favorably.</P>
      <P>This will help tourists from China to have better travel quality,
while Taiwan will have an effective management mechanism to cut the
unease of local people and help boost local tourism, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ANNOUNCES NEW STEPS TO BOOST CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh announced three key
policy measures to promote civilian and commercial exchanges across
the Taiwan Strait Monday, including authorizing the Taipei Airlines
Association (TAA) to negotiate with its Chinese counterpart on the
opening of direct cross-strait charter cargo flights.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the announcement while attending a seminar with
executives of major Taiwanese trade associations in China, who
returned to Taiwan over the weekend for the Dragon Boat Festival
celebrations.</P>
      <P>The premier told the 100-plus executives that the government is
determined to authorize private organizations to assist in fleshing
out technical details for opening cross-strait charter cargo flights,
exporting Taiwan agricultural products to China and allowing Chinese
residents to sightsee in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that the Chinese authorities will understand our
goodwill and open substantive talks with Taiwan to resolve bilateral
issues in a realistic manner," Hsieh claimed.</P>
      <P>In addition to commissioning the TAA to negotiate the charter
cargo flight issue, Hsieh said the government has decided to
authorize the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) to
talk with relevant Chinese authorities on the shipment of
Taiwanese agricultural products to China.</P>
      <P>As to the opening of Taiwan's doors to Chinese tourists, Hsieh
said the government will commission an "appropriate organization" to
assist in setting the stage for bilateral talks on related issues.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's announcement marked the first time the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration has unveiled concrete steps to
promote cross-strait exchanges since China enacted its anti-secession
law in mid-March that codifies the use of non-peaceful means against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the Chinese legislation marked a grave
setback in the development of cross-strait relations, Hsieh said the
government will continue to deal with cross-strait issues in line
with the principle of "reconciliation without retreat and
steadfastness without confrontation."</P>
      <P>"Even though the cross-strait situation remains grim, the
government will continue promoting cross-strait exchanges in
consideration of people's well-being, including the interests of
those with investments in China, " Hsieh said. To help Taiwanese
businessmen cut transportation costs, Hsieh said the government is
willing to open direct cross-strait charter cargo flights based on
the formula set forth in the Lunar New Year charter passenger flight
arrangements earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he has directed the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to work with the
TAA in preparation for negotiations with China on opening direct
charter cargo flights. As for agricultural exports to China, Hsieh
said that even though China recently announced preferential treatment
for Taiwan-produced fresh fruit, Taiwan's agricultural shipments to
China have been limited. In 2004, Taiwan exported only
US$890,000-worth of farm produce to China, accounting for a marginal
1.06 percent of Taiwan's total agricultural exports, or 0.16 percent
of its total agricultural production.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Hsieh said, China has deliberately attracted
Taiwan farmers and businesses to invest in agricultural production in
China, leading to an exodus of Taiwan's farming experts, fine grain
and fruit strains and core farming expertise.</P>
      <P>In the future, he went on, the government will rein in
cross-strait agricultural trade in accordance with the principles of
"active opening, effective management" with a view to establishing an
cross-strait agricultural market and guiding Taiwan's agriculture to
develop in a healthier direction.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the Cabinet has instructed the Council of Agriculture
to coordinate with the MAC and local farmer's associations in
organizing a professional negotiating team. In addition, he said, the
government has commissioned TAITRA to assist in arranging for talks
with its Chinese counterparts regarding customs clearance, quarantine
and inspection and other technical issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POPULATION TO REGISTER NEGATIVE GROWTH FROM 2117: MOI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan faces an urgent need to enhance its
birth rate because the total population might begin to register
negative growth from 2117, Vice Minister of the Interior Chien
Tai-lang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's birth rate was 1.18 per woman of childbearing age in
2004, far lower than the average of 1.6 registered in member states
of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ,
Chien said.</P>
      <P>To address the declining birth rate issue, Chien said, former
Premier Yu Shyi-kun directed the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) to
draft a white paper on population policy.</P>
      <P>"In line with Yu's directive, the MOI has drafted a white paper
which outlines suggestions for encouraging childbirth from economic
and non-economic perspectives," Chien said.</P>
      <P>As population policy involves a broad range of issues, Chien
said, Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan directed at an
inter-ministerial meeting last week that the white paper should not
be presented to the Cabinet for discussion at present and should be
subject to further debate by officials from different departments and
experts from relevant social groups.</P>
      <P>Instead, Chien went on, the MOI will present a package of policy
guidelines to the Cabinet later this month for approval. The MOI will
then further flesh out the population policy white paper based on the
guidelines.</P>
      <P>According to a study by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, 20 percent of local women of child-bearing age have
never given birth. At present, about two breadwinners support one
non-breadwinners (referring to those aged under 15 and older than
65) . If the current low birth rate trend continues, the ratio will
become one to one in 50 years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
touted Taiwan's policy toward China while leading a group of foreign
representatives to Taiwan on a tour of the outlying island county of
Kinmen Monday.</P>
      <P>Tan told them that the development of ties between Taiwan and
China takes time and that the key to improving ties lies in a "live
and let live" approach by both sides, with any bilateral negotiations
conducted at government level.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Huang Wei-feng, vice chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council, Tan took his guests to the Shuitou Wharf to see the
ferry service between Kinmen and Xiamen in China's Fujian Province,
which is the center piece of the so-called "mini-three-links."</P>
      <P>Chen said the success of the mini-three-links vindicates the

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS ASK FOR REINSTATEMENT OF U.S. BEEF IMPORT BAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several legislators from across the
political spectrum called Tuesday for Department of Health (DOH)
Minister Ho Sheng-mao to remove U.S. beef products from store shelves
and to reinstate the U.S. beef import ban that was lifted barely two
months ago.</P>
      <P>The legislators were Lai Shin-yuan and David Huang of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, Lai Shyh-bao of the Kuomintang, and Huang Wei-cher
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Lai Shin-yuan noted that although there are around 60 countries
that currently import U.S. beef, quite a few of these countries are
affected areas of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>She noted that Taiwan is not one of the BSE-affected countries,
but it rashly decided to lift the ban.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that although a suspected BSE case was detected
in the United States June 10, Chen Lu-hung, director of the DOH's
Bureau of Food Sanitation, said Monday that the DOH will only decide
on the matter after a further test in Britain on the U.S. sample.</P>
      <P>Lai Shyh-bao criticized the DOH for not adequately protecting
public health and demanded that the department suspend U.S. beef
imports, remove U.S. beef products from store shelves, discipline
negligent officials, and convene a hearing to make transparent its
decision-making process on allowing the U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Ho said that the matter will be handled strictly on
considerations of professionalism.</P>
      <P>He quoted World Organization for Animal Health guidelines as
stating that boneless beef with no other specific dangerous
substances from animals under 30 months of age can be exported even
from BSE-infected areas.</P>
      <P>He also said that DOH's decision to remove the U.S. beef import
ban in April was arrived at after careful consideration and that the
department invites BSE experts to review its decision-making
process.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the DOH's policy has nothing to do with
instructions from the Presidential Office or the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all
related products in December 2003 after the discovery in Washington
State of a single BSE case.</P>
      <P>On April 16 this year, Taiwan began to allow imports of U.S.
boneless beef from animals under 30 months of age.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAITRA READY TO TALK WITH CHINA ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT EXPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) is ready to take on the task of paving the way for
the direct export of fruits from Taiwan to China given the council's
extensive experience over the past 34 years, the council's top
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chao Yung-chuan, TAITRA secretary-general, made the remarks one
day after Premier Frank Hsieh said the government has decided to
authorize TAITRA to talk with relevant Chinese authorities on
exporting Taiwanese agricultural products to China.</P>
      <P>"TAITRA will do all it can to be the best conduit," Chao said.</P>
      <P>Chao said that TAITRA is only an intermediary agency and the
Council of Agriculture and the Mainland Affairs Council have to do
the main planning. Once they have completed this, the council will
open discussions with the Chinese side, he added.</P>
      <P>He noted that since 2002, the council has invited big Chinese
buyers, such as large supermarkets and agricultural products
companies, to take part in exhibitions and buy from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>TAITRA has also sponsored Taiwan agricultural festivals in big
cities and organized delegations to take part in agricultural
exhibitions in China, Chao said.</P>
      <P>The council plans to set up footholds in Beijing and Shanghai
this year, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan exported US$3.4 billion of agricultural
products last year, and fruits accounted for 2.5 percent (US$86
million) of these. Among them, fruit processed products, such as
dehydrated products and fruit juices exports totaled US$53 million,
while fresh fruits totaled US$33 million, or only 1 percent.</P>
      <P>The main markets for Taiwan's fresh fruits are Japan (accounting
for 50 percent), followed by the United States (25 percent) and Hong
Kong (25 percent.) Direct exports to China only totaled US$340,000.</P>
      <P>Chao noted that the biggest challenge for Taiwan fruits will be
their high cost, saying that China has only given 18 Taiwan fruits
tariff-free treatment. Fruits from Vietnam and Thailand also enjoy
the same treatment, but they have far lower production costs.</P>
      <P>In addition, the biggest worry is that Chinese consumers may only
buy Taiwan fruits once out of curiosity and will not buy them again.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan fruits should target high-end department
stores in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen.</P>
      <P>Only when there is a bumper year for certain fruits, such as
citrus, will the council promote them in wholesale shops.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tseng Yung-chuan, director of the policy committee of
the opposition Kuomintang, wondered if the government had chosen
TAITRA out of political considerations since it has close relations
with the industrial and business sectors, instead of the provincial
agricultural association, which is familiar with the marketing of
agricultural products, in handling the exports.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the government should be responsible if the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Minister without Portfolio
Lin Ferng-ching on Monday signed a memorandum of agreement with the
Berkeley branch of the University of California to promote exchanges
and cooperation in the field of information security.</P>
      <P>Lin, who doubles as the deputy convener of the Executive Yuan's
Science and Technology Advisory Group, is leading a four-member
delegation on a visit to San Francisco, California. He signed the
deal with Paul R. Gray, executive vice chancellor and provost of UC
Berkeley, in an effort to enhance Taiwan's manpower and technological
capability in the information security sector.</P>
      <P>Lin explained that the memorandum covers three categories:
technological research and transfer, personnel exchanges, and
consultations. The exchanges will involve government and academia.</P>
      <P>Besides the UC Berkeley links, the delegation, organized to seek
cross-national information security technological cooperation, will
also sign a cooperative memorandum with Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU) during its U.S. visit.</P>
      <P>The two universities enjoy great prestige in the fields of
information technology and information communication security. UC
Berkeley is a leading institute on the research of computer security
in the United States, while CMU has been presiding over the U.S.
government's information security projects for years. Taiwan can
learn from their expertise and knowledge in dealing with information
security incidents, a member of the delegation said.</P>
      <P>Chen Ju-fen, the executive director of the Cabinet's
technological consultant group, explained that information security
is a big field, which covers governmental administration, corporate
operations, and personal confidential information.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET URGES LEGISLATURE TO CONVENE EXTRA SESSION ON FLOOD CONTROL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Executive Yuan Spokesman Cho Jung-tai on
Tuesday urged the Legislative Yuan to convene an extra session late
next month on urgent bills such as an eight-year NT$80 billion
(US$2.54 billion) flood-control project.</P>
      <P>Cho made the appeal after heavy flooding that caused tremendous
losses to people living in southern areas of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Cho, the central government and a dozen local
governments, as well as the Ministry of National Defense have set up
emergency centers for rescue and relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh has ordered the Department of Health and the
Environmental Protection Administration to watch closely the
post-disaster situation in order to prevent contagious diseases from
breaking out, Cho said. Hsieh also instructed Council of Agriculture
Chairman Lee Ching-lung to present an agricultural loss report to
subsidize farmers suffering from the inundation, Cho added.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet presented the flood-control budget bill to the
legislature for approval on May 18; however, the bill has not been
passed although it was put on the agenda on May 24. The Legislative
Yuan has been in recess since late May.</P>
      <P>Cho noted that many areas of Taiwan suffer from inundation due to
lowered surface levels as a result of excessive use of groundwater
from wells; therefore, the flood-control project requires huge
efforts from both the government and the people, and the work is
urgent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said earlier
in the day that the Cabinet can first use the reserves of its budget
to deal with the flooding, while the NT$80 billion flood-control
project needs to be discussed between the different political
parties.</P>

(By Mike Chang and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwan aboriginal protesters led
by Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei were barred Tuesday from approaching a
controversial shrine for war dead in Tokyo, where their ancestors who
were forced to fight for the Japanese Imperial Army during World War
II are honored.</P>
      <P>The protesters had originally planned to stage a demonstration
outside the Yasukuni Shrine to demand the removal of the deceased
aboriginal soldiers' tablets so that their spirits could be escorted
back to Taiwan. But they were stopped by Japanese police around 200
meters away from the shrine and prohibited from getting off their
buses.</P>
      <P>With the help of officials from Taiwan's representative office in
Japan, Kao Chin finally was allowed to get off her bus to talk to the
media.</P>
      <P>Lashing out at Japanese police over their actions, the aboriginal
lawmaker from the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union said she will keep
coming back until she achieves her goal.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin stressed that the spirits of the aboriginal soldiers
cannot rest in peace at the Yasukuni Shrine because they were forced
into military service and were not Japanese.</P>
      <P>Dozens of Japanese right-wingers had gathered at main entrances
of the shrine before the Taiwan protesters arrived in an attempt to
disturb their planned demonstration, prompting the dispatch of
hundreds of policemen to the scene to maintain order for fear that
the situation might lead to violence.</P>
      <P>The Yasukuni Shrine is dedicated to 2.5 million soldiers who died
fighting for Japan, including more than 28,000 from Taiwan. It has
drawn controversy mainly because a group of war criminals are also
enshrined there.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin sued Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi two years
ago for violating Japan's constitution by paying a visit to the
shrine, but the suit was rejected by an Osaka district court. Kao
later appealed, and the high court of Osaka is expected to announce
its ruling on the appeal on June 17.</P>

    <HEADLINE>60% IN HALF OF TAIWAN'S CITIES, COUNTIES SATISFIED WITH SOCIAL ORDER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The average approval rating for social
order in Taiwan's 23 cities and counties is 55.86 percent, although
over half of the cities and counties have an approval rating of more
than 60 percent, a poll showed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted by the Ministry of the Interior May 20-28
and asked about social order between March and May. A total of 23,596
effective samples were collected.</P>
      <P>The top three counties that have the highest approval ratings are
Penghu, Taitung and Ilan in that order, while the lowest approval
ratings are in Taichung City, Taipei County, and Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The poll also showed that 5.74 percent of residents have been
burglarized over the past three months, and the highest burglary
ratio was reported in Kaohsiung and Pingtung at 6.46 percent. Just
over 77 percent of residents have received fraud messages over the
past three months to try to swindle them, and 1.28 percent were taken
in.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 25.9 percent attributed poor social order to the
deteriorating economy and high unemployment, followed by the
government's failure to uphold public authority or political
instability (13.21 percent), and decadent ethics and morality (10.95
percent).</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan invited local chiefs early this year to meet
to join in a campaign to improve social order on the island and the
poll was one of the results of the efforts put forth by various
cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Other factors were that judicial authorities have been too
lenient on perpetrators (8.72 percent) , media over-reporting of
criminal cases (8.66 percent) , and educational failures (8.29
percent).</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Tuesday
received Taiwan delegates who participated in this year's WorldSkills
Competition in May and braved opposition from the organizer to wave
Republic of China national flags at the opening ceremony.
</P>
      <P>Under pressure from Beijing, Finland, the organizer of the 38th

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO NAME GROUPS FOR CROSS-STRAIT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai urged China
Tuesday to appoint intermediary bodies to negotiate with parallel
Taiwan organizations for opening direct charter cargo flights across
the Taiwan Strait and other issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Cho made the call a day after Premier Frank Hsieh announced that
the Republic of China government will take positive steps to boost
cross-strait exchanges, including ordering the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) to cooperate with other relevant government agencies to
flesh out details for direct cross-strait charter cargo flights,
sales of Taiwan farm produce to China and sightseeing trips to Taiwan
by Chinese citizens.</P>
      <P>While dining with a group of Taiwan businessmen operating in
China who returned over the weekend for the Dragon Boat Festival
celebrations, Hsieh also said the government will commission the
Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) to negotiate cross-strait charter
cargo flights with China and the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) to negotiate sales of Taiwan farm produce to China.</P>
      <P>"Now that the premier has outlined options acceptable to us, we
hope China can make a goodwill response by appointing its parallel
organizations for bilateral negotiations on the cargo flights and
farm trade issues, " Cho said, adding that Beijing is welcome to
announce its intermediary bodies at a news conference to be held by
its Taiwan Affairs Office Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Should that be the case, cross-strait consultations on direct
charter cargo flights and farm trade could begin very soon, " Cho
said.</P>
      <P>As to opening the door for Chinese residents to sightsee in
Taiwan, Cho said the government has yet to choose a suitable body to
negotiate with China because the issue involves more complicated
technical details related to the exercise of public authorities.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said earlier in the day that he looks
forward to the participation of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
in the negotiations for opening sightseeing trips to Taiwan by
Chinese residents.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a quasi-official intermediary body authorized to
handle cross-strait exchanges with China in the absence of official
contacts. However, Beijing has unilaterally suspended the
institutionalized interaction between the SEF and its Chinese
counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) -- since mid-1999 over then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui's
definition of bilateral ties as being state-to-state in nature.</P>
      <P>If China still does not allow ARATS officials to talk with their
SEF counterparts over the tourist issue, Wu said the government would
not rule out commissioning other appropriate body to negotiate the
issue. But he added whatever the body, the negotiating team should
include officials from the Immigration Bureau, the Tourism Bureau and
the SEF.</P>
      <P>Noting that the SEF has a long history of dealing with China, Wu
said its officials should have a role in the negotiations for opening
the door to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The nation's top mainland policy planner further said the ROC
government has been pragmatic and flexible in managing cross-strait
affairs while adhering to its fundamental stance and core values.</P>
      <P>"Anything involving state authority must be negotiated by
government officials or in a way acceptable to us. Nevertheless, we
are willing to exercise flexibility toward the setting in order to
achieve concrete results," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Take the opening of direct cross-strait charter passenger flights
during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday earlier this year as an
example, he said.</P>
      <P>"Regardless of the title used in the negotiations in Macau for
the temporary holiday charter flights, our civil aviation chief
presided over the negotiations in person on that occasion," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu was referring to Civil Aeronautics Administration Director
Chang Kuo-cheng, who took part in the cross-strait charter passenger
flights negotiations in Macau with Chinese officials as an adviser to
the private Taipei Airlines Association.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EIGHT-YEAR, NT$80 BILLION PROPOSAL CAN SOLVE FLOOD PROBLEMS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that his
proposal for an eight-year, NT$80 billion (US$2.54 billion)
flood-control project will solve the flooding problems of the entire
nation.</P>
      <P>The premier said the project was not "absurd" as opposition
parties have alleged, saying that those who have not suffered from
serious flooding cannot know the misery of those who have gone
through such an ordeal.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out at the headquarters of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party that the government has appropriated NT$1 billion
every year for flood control, but if the problems have to be
addressed year by year, it may take 80 years to completely fix the
problems.</P>
      <P>He noted that the flooding problems in Shertze and Hsichi in
Taipei and Kaohsiung have been solved, and the key is whether the
government is willing to take the problem seriously for the rest of
the country.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the government spent more than NT$40 billion to
solve the Hsichi flooding problems, and nobody said that that was too
much. The proposed NT$80 billion will solve the flooding problems of
the entire nation, and he asked, "How can that be too much?"</P>
      <P>Because Taipei is a metropolitan city, its flooding problems were
solved early, but can the problem in other places wait 80 years? he
asked.</P>
      <P>He said that before he assumed the premiership, he was Kaohsiung
mayor, and the city had serious flooding problems. But when visiting
Kaohsiung Sunday, he found an installed pond had caught 110,000 tons
of waters after flash flooding and had prevented serious problems for
local residents.</P>
      <P>On Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's remarks that the
government's emergency fund could be used, the premier said that the
fund can indeed be used in emergency situations, but that the money
available is limited.</P>
      <P>He said that if the Legislative Yuan can pass the eight-year,
NT$80 billion flood-control project, it would mean that there will be
NT$20 billion available in the first two years, and the flooding
problems in most of the population-dense areas, such as Hsinchuang
and Hsulin in Taipei county, can be solved.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng,
who is running for the Kuomintang (KMT) chairmanship, said in
Taitung, eastern Taiwan Tuesday that the new party leader must be
capable of leading the opposition party to winning back the

      <P>At a campaign meeting with KMT leaders in Taitung, Wang said five
years after the Democratic Progressive Party took power, the country
is still beset by financial problems, stagnant ties with China and
confrontations among various ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>The only way for the country to weather these problems, Wang
said, is for the KMT to win back power.</P>
      <P>However, Wang said, for the KMT to win in the 2008 presidential
election, the party will need a leader who can deliver on five urgent
tasks.</P>
      <P>He said the five tasks are pressing on with party reforms,
handling the thorny issue of the party's assets, commanding the
support of the People First Party and the New Party -- which are KMT
spin-offs -- leading the KMT to control at least half of the 23
counties and cities in the year-end elections for county and city
chiefs, and finding a candidate who can win the 2008 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Although he was not specific, the KMT vice chairman is suggesting
that he can do all of these and is therefore the best man to take up
the reins of the party.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
decide whether to protest to Japan for blocking a planned

aboriginal soldiers who fought for the Japanese after gathering more
information on the incident, a ministry official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The protesters led by aboriginal Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei had
planned to demonstrate Tuesday outside the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo,
where their ancestors who fought for the Japanese Imperial Army
during World War II are honored. They are demanding the removal of
the aboriginal soldiers' tablets from the shrine "so that their
spirits can be escorted back to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>But they were stopped about 200 meters from the shrine and
prohibited from getting off their buses by Japanese police for fear
that they might clash with a group of Japanese right-wingers who had
gathered at the scene ahead of their arrival.</P>
      <P>According to Liao Ching-pang, an official in charge of
Taiwan-Japan relations at the MOFA's Department of East Asian and

    <HEADLINE>INVESTMENT COMMISSION EXPLAINS REGULATIONS ON INVESTMENT IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June,  14 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Investment Commission under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said Tuesday that the Taiwanese investor
who owns "dominating power" over a company situated in an overseas
area outside Taiwan or China must apply for government permission
before investing in China.</P>
      <P>A report of a controversial plan by Taiwan's semiconductor giant,
the United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , to invest in the
Suzhou-based He Jian Technology in China via its Japanese subsidiary
has recently raised debate among local businessmen on the legality of
investment projects of this kind.</P>
      <P>Explaining the existing regulations in terms of investment in
China, officials said that individuals and enterprises in Taiwan are
allowed to invest there directly or indirectly -- making such
investments through corporate operations in "third areas" outside
Taiwan and China -- after they are granted permission by the
Investment Commission.</P>
      <P>If a company in a "third place" acts to invest in China and their
Taiwanese investors are the "dominating power" in the firm, such a
plan is considered by the Taiwan government as indirect investment,
which requires government permission, the officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Michael Jackson Cleared
After 14-Week Child Molesting Trial.

Michael Jackson was acquitted on Monday of all charges against
him by a jury that absorbed three months of often lurid testimony
about his life and relationships with young boys but rejected a
teenager's claim that Jackson plied him with liquor and sexually
molested him. A Santa Maria jury found Jackson not guilty of four
charges of child molesting, one charge of attempted child molesting,
one conspiracy charge and eight possible counts of providing alcohol
to minors. The eight women and four men of the jury deliberated for
about 30 hours over seven days before saying shortly after noon that
they had reached a decision.

Wall Street Journal: Exxon Chief Makes A Cold Calculation on
Global Warming.

At Exxon Mobil Corp.'s laboratories, scientists are trying to
perfect an oil that could sell to companies operating wind turbines.
Oil giants such as BP PLC and Royal Dutch/Shell Group are trumpeting
abetter-safe-than-sorry approach to global warming. They accept a
growing scientific consensus that fossil fuels are a main contributor
to the problem and endorse the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which caps
emissions from developed nations that have ratified it. BP and Shell
also have begun to invest in alternatives to fossil fuels. Exxon
publicly predicts that solar and wind energy will continue to provide
less than 1 percent of the world's energy supply in 2025, a subject
that others shy away from. Even if fossil fuels are the chief
global-warming culprit, Exxon argues, the sensible response is to
figure out how to burn them more efficiently.</TEXT>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu described China
Tuesday as a "haven for criminals" because so many Taiwanese
criminals have fled there to evade punishment.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
Central Executive Committee, in which Minister of the Interior Su

      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said the improvement of social order

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's son will donate
a total of NT$2 million (US$63,694) in cash to three charitable
organizations in the southern county of Tainan to mark his wedding
this weekend, a Presidential Office spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Chen Chih-chung will follow the example set by his elder sister
four years ago in donating money to social welfare groups to mark his
wedding," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The president's daughter, Chen Hsing-yu, donated NT$2 million to
low-income families when she married four years ago. Of the money,
NT$1.5 million was the dowry given by her father and the remaining
NT$500,000 came from her own savings.</P>
      <P>"Chen Chih-chung and his fiancee will donate the same amount of
money to three charitable organizations, including the Tainan County
LifeLine Association, in the president's home county, with the money
coming from their parents and their own savings, " the spokesman
explained.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung was engaged to his fiancee Huang Jui-ching in
Taichung City last weekend and they will get married in Taipei this
week.</P>
      <P>The president originally asked the Presidential Office's
Department of Public Affairs to assist in calling a news conference
to brief the media on procedures of Chen Chih-chung's wedding.
However, the first family decided to cancel the news conference after
flash floods brought by heavy rain in the past few days wreaked
havoc in the three southern counties of Pingtung, Kaohsiung and
Tainan.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office spokesman said the first family will not
accept any money or gifts for Chen Chih-chung's wedding.</P>
      <P>"The first family will only accept good wishes from relatives and
friends," the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung, who obtained a master's degree in law from the
University of California at Berkeley in May, will travel to the
United States with his pianist wife, where they will continue their
studies. Huang Jui-ching has a master's in piano performance from the

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has lived up to "world standards" in
the fight against illicit drug trafficking, the deputy head of the
Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>David Keegan, deputy director of the AIT Taipei Office, made the
remarks while addressing the opening of an anti-drug trafficking
workshop at the headquarters of the Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau (MJIB) in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>The workshop was co-sponsored by the MJIB and the United States'
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) . Similar seminars were held in
Taipei in 2002 and 2004.</P>
      <P>Keegan said that even though Taiwan is not a signatory to the
United Nation's Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs
and Psychotropic Substances, its anti-drug trafficking mechanism and
legislation fully meet the
U.N.-set standards.</P>
      <P>Taiwan used to be a major transshipment stop for illicit drugs
delivered to the United States, Keegan noted, adding that the
situation improved after Taiwan stepped up the fight against illegal
drug trafficking and crafted a world-class anti-drug trafficking
system.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin
said Taiwan has made significant progress in the crackdown on illicit
drug trafficking and abuse. In 2004, he said, 3,000 kg of amphetamine
were seized, accounting for 60 percent of the total drug seizures for
that year. Law enforcement officers seized 551 kg of raw materials
for producing amphetamine, indicating that plants that moved abroad a
few years ago might have been moved back, Shih said, adding that the
MJIB will strengthen cooperation with the Industrial Development
Bureau (IDB) to rein in the flow of relevant raw materials.</P>
      <P>The DEA has sent instructors to teach local law enforcement
officers, including MJIB investigators, prosecutors, coast guard
officers, IDB officials and health care staff, how to detect illicit
drug trafficking and controlled chemicals that could be used to
produce illicit drugs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) officials said Tuesday that renewable energy has
great market potential in the next decade, as its
electricity-generating costs have been falling.</P>
      <P>Citing a report from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL) of the United States, CEPD officials said the cost of
electricity-generating from wind, geothermal, solar and biomass power
has been reducing since 1980, with the electricity-generating cost
from wind power dropping to between four and six cents per unit in
2004.</P>
      <P>According to U.S.-based Business Communications Co. Inc, the
global production of renewable energy totalled US$26.64 billion in
2003, with the figure expected to reach US$41.62 billion in 2008.</P>
      <P>In that year, the top three forms of renewable energy will be
wind, hydro and solar power, in that order, researchers said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, experts from American research firm Clean Edge, which
helps investors to understand and reap profit from emerging
clean-energy markets, said clean energy will focus on solar, wind
power and fuel cells in the next decade, with production value
reaching US$39.2 billion, US$48.1 billion and US$15.1 billion,
respectively, in 2014 from US$7.2 billion, US$8 billion, and US$900
million in 2004, respectively.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said Taiwan should develop renewable energy to
reduce its heavy energy dependence on other countries, adding that
the Ministry of Economic Affairs has plans to increase the percentage
of renewable energy in the country's total energy capacity to 10
percent in 2010 from the 5.5 percent in 2004.</P>
      <P>By doing so, the officials said, it is expected to significantly
reduce carbon dioxide emissions and save energy imports by NT$113
billion (US$3.6 billion) , while generating production value of
related industries by NT$44 billion.</P>
      <P>The officials urged the early legislation of renewable energy
development regulations to eliminate barriers to its development.</P>

      <P>An American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
official claimed Tuesday that U.S. beef will remain safe, regardless
of the results of a possible second case of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>According to Scott S. Sindelar, chief of the Agricultural Section
at the AIT's Taipei office, this is not a new case but a re-test of
an old sample taken during an extensive cattle herd surveillance
program prior to December 2004.</P>
      <P>As an enhanced surveillance program started in June 2004, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture has tested more than 375,000 animals
from the targeted cattle population using a rapid test, three of
which tested inconclusive, Sindelar said.</P>
      <P>The three samples tested negative in subsequent
immunohistochemistry testing, but one of them was positive using the
Western blot test, Sindelar said.</P>
      <P>He said the sample was sent to England for further testing and
that the results are expected in two weeks.</P>
      <P>Although the targeted animals account for only 0.5 percent of the
entire cattle population in the United States, they are considered a
high-risk group that has been banned from the human food supply
chain, he added.</P>

(By Lin Yu-kuo &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. policy toward Taiwan remains
unchanged and President George Bush is expected to carry on this
policy, which recognizes only one China and does not support Taiwan
independence, former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said here
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to delegates at a Pacific Basin Economic Council
business conference, Powell admitted that there is a trade dispute
between China and the United States over China's textile exports,
saying it will be sorted out eventually as long as both sides face up
to their differences pragmatically.</P>
      <P>He played down the significance of trade disputes, arguing that
they are common between countries. Citing examples to support his
stance, Powell pointed out that the U.S. also has trade disputes with
Canada, Mexico and the European Union.</P>
      <P>"It is not so much that you have these disputes, but the question
is, do you resolve them?" he said.</P>
      <P>As to the exchange rate for China's renminbi, Powell said that
instead of pressuring China into appreciating its currency, Beijing
leaders should be given time and room to exercise their own judgment,
claiming that they will eventually do on their own what the rest of
the world believes is right.</P>
      <P>The former U.S. secretary of state said he does not see any
threat to Washington from China's increase in weapons spending,
noting that China is at least 10 years behind the United States in
military strength.</P>
      <P>However, Powell said, China should increase the transparency in
its arms purchase programs to increase the trust of other countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EDUCATION MINISTRY CALLS FOR UPHOLDING OF NATIONAL DIGNITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education called Wednesday
for those in Taiwan's education sector to uphold the Republic of
China's national dignity while engaging in academic exchanges with
their counterparts from China.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-pao, director of the Ministry of Education's Department
of Technological Vocational Education, said that it is the ministry's
set policy that the ROC's national dignity and soverignty "should not
be dented or infringed upon" during cross-strait academic exchanges
or related activities.</P>
      <P>Chang was referring to a newspaper report Wednesday that said
authorities from the Hsiuping Institute of Technology had removed the
ROC national flag and the picture of the ROC founding father, Sun
Yat-sen, for a commencement ceremony held at the institute's stadium
a couple of days ago to "please several mainland Chinese guests who
were attending the graduation ceremony."</P>
      <P>Chang said that the move was "extremely inappropriate" because it
represented a "denting of the ROC's national dignity."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su Tseng-chang, chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, called for the administration to immediately
discipline the Hsiuping Institute in accordance with the law for
impairing the ROC's national dignity.</P>
      <P>Su said that the institute had "dwarfed" the ROC's sovereignty by
removing the national flag in front of the mainland Chinese visitors.
"This is absolutely unacceptable and should be dealt with squarely, "
he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Hsiuping authorities said that the news report's
claim that the national flag and the picture of Sun Yat-sen were
removed to please the mainland guests was untrue and unfounded.</P>
      <P>Hsiuping President Lin Pao-tsong said that the flag and picture
were removed to cope with the needs of stage design for the
commencement ceremony and that the same thing has been done for years
for graduation ceremonies at the institute.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that there were a great number of ROC national flags
along the roads leading to the stadium and around the campus and that
"the last thing the institute would do would be to remove the
national flag to please anyone from China."</P>
      <P>According to the report, some parents of the graduates informed
the daily about the national flag removal incident.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that if those parents had attended previous
commencement ceremonies held by the institute, then they would know
that the removal of the flag and picture was just a regular part of
setting up the graduation ceremony stage and that it was in no way
related to the fact that a few people from China happened to be
attending this year's ceremony.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER REQUESTS EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION TO PASS FLOOD-CONTROL BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh on Wednesday again
called for the Legislative Yuan to convene an extraordinary session
so as to pass the Executive Yuan's proposed special flood-control
statute and its eight-year, NT$80 billion (US$2.54 billion) budget as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The 6th Legislative Yuan went into recess at the end of May after
concluding its first session.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that torrential rains over the past few days
have inundated many areas in southern Taiwan. He attributed the
serious flooding in these areas to three factors -- climate change
which leads to heavy rainfall, clogged sewage systems, and
insufficient flood-fighting facilities.</P>
      <P>He pointed to the success of the flood-control projects in
Kaohsiung City and for the Keelung River in Taipei City as examples,
noting that neither municipality has reported flooding during the
recent heavy downpours. However, he stressed that flood-fighting
projects require funding, saying that this is why his Cabinet has
proposed the special flood-control budget.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has spent NT$70 billion (US$2.22
billion) on the flood-control system for the Keelung River, Yu said
that "spending NT$80 billion on flood-control for the entire nation
is not a huge sum."</P>
      <P>Lai Ching-te, a caucus whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) in the legislature, said the premier will call on the DPP
caucus Friday to communicate with it on his hope that the legislature
will convene a special session and pass the flood-fighting budget.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), a DPP ally, has been lukewarm
toward the premier's proposal, urging instead that the government use
a special fund reserved for emergency use.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ho Min-hao, TSU caucus whip in the legislature, urged
the government to use the fund for residents in the flood-affected
areas immediately, and not to resort to asking the legislature to
convene a special session to review the special budget proposal which
he said will be "too late for dealing with the current disaster."</P>
      <P>Ho also said that he is worried that "flood-fighting" could turn
into an excuse for local governments to ask for more money from the
central government.</P>
      <P>However, Lai said that money from the special fund is limited and
is not sufficient for the flood-fighting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) criticized the
Cabinet's proposed special budget.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan said the appropriation of special budgets
must meet stringent preconditions, lamenting that in recent years,
the appropriation of special budgets has become common practice.</P>
      <P>Local governments have funds reserved for disasters, and the
government "should not resort to populism to try to ram through its
special budget proposal" via an extraordinary session of the
legislature, which he termed as a "very irresponsible approach."</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said the Executive Yuan
has at least NT$19.3 billion at its disposal, which he said is more
than enough to deal with the flooding in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan should use this money for post-disaster
relief, Wang said, adding that whether the legislature holds a
special session as requested by the premier to pass the flood-control
budget will depend on the results of inter-party consultations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW KMT CHIEF SHOULD LEAD PARTY TO WIN YEAR-END ELECTIONS: MAYOR MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles
as a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said Wednesday
that the new chairman of the party must be capable of leading the KMT
to win back its dominance in the year-end mayoral and county chief
elections.</P>
      <P>Ma, a candidate for the KMT chairmanship, said that regardless of
who wins the chairmanship election slated for July 16, that person
must be capable of first leading the KMT to winning at least half of
the 23 counties and cities in the year-end elections for county and
city chiefs.</P>
      <P>"This is a prerequisite to becoming a KMT chairman hopeful, " Ma
said, adding that if the hopeful cannot do it, he should not run.</P>
      <P>Ma also noted that the 2005 mayoral and county chief elections
are only some of the many elections that will be held in the years
leading up to the 2008 presidential election, saying that the KMT
should win every election over the following three years, including
the presidential election in 2008 and the legislative elections in
2007.</P>
      <P>Ma's opponent in the race for the KMT chairmanship, Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, said a day earlier that the new party
leader must be capable of leading the KMT to win back the presidency.</P>
      <P>At a campaign meeting with KMT leaders in Taitung, eastern
Taiwan, Wang said that five years after the Democratic Progressive
Party took power, the country is still beset by financial problems,
stagnant ties with China, and confrontation among the various ethnic
groups.</P>
      <P>The only way for the country to weather these problems, Wang
said, is for the KMT to win back power.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY HAS NO PLANS TO SEND KNOX-CLASS FRIGATE NEAR DISPUTED WATERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense turned
down Wednesday a request by an opposition lawmaker that the military
send a Knox-class frigate on June 17 to waters near a disputed part
of the East China Sea to flex Taiwan's muscle against Japan.</P>
      <P>Ministry spokesman Liu Chih-chien said the military has no plans
to do so because most available military forces have been deployed to
take part in the "Hankuang 21" exercises.</P>
      <P>Liu said the three frigates already deployed by the military near
the disputed waters should be sufficient to serve the purpose.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Lin Yu-fang, a
co-convener of the legislature's National Defense Committee, made the
request in the wake of a serious conflict breaking out last week in
waters off Taiwan's northeast coast between Taiwanese fishermen and
the Japanese coast guard following the latest expulsion of Taiwanese
fishermen from the area.</P>
      <P>The incident occurred in an area of the East China Sea where the
exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan overlap.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that Japan is "much more polite" to Chinese and South
Korean fishermen operating in the same waters and doesn't dare
arbitrarily expel them.</P>
      <P>Blaming the situation on the "long-time cowardice" of the
government of Taiwan, Lin urged the military to get tough with Japan
to boost Taiwan's leverage, especially when both countries are set to
open a new round of fishery talks in July.</P>
      <P>Lin said he will go ahead with his fact-finding sail to an area
near the disputed waters on June 17 regardless of the Ministry of
National Defense's request for him to postpone the trip on the
grounds that the timing is too sensitive.</P>
      <P>He also threatened to block the ministry's NT$480 billion U.S.
arms procurement package and cut the ministry's annual budget by at
least NT$50 billion if the ministry refuses to send a Knox-class
frigate to accompany him on the trip.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINIMUM TAX SYSTEM TO BE IN PLACE BY YEAR'S END: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh reaffirmed the
government's determination Wednesday to impose a minimum tax system
by the end of this year as part of its tax reform plan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Hsieh said there is a high
degree of consensus in Taiwan society on implementing a minimum tax
system. Even though some business tycoons have voiced opposition to
the proposed minimum tax scheme, he said, the government will not
waver in its stance on this reform plan.</P>
      <P>"The proposed minimum tax scheme must be in place by year's end
because it is closely related to fairness in our taxation system, "
Hsieh said, adding that this round of tax reform will focus on
introducing a minimum tax mechanism.</P>
      <P>Referring to Hon Hai Precision Industry Chairman Terry Kuo's
scathing criticism of the government's minimum tax reform plan, Hsieh
said Kuo is not alone in opposing this new tax measure.</P>
      <P>"Kuo is just more outspoken in expressing his own feelings. The
government recognizes Kuo's contributions to Taiwan's industrial
development. I hope Kuo and other business magnates can understand
the government's ultimate goals in tax reform. We will not waiver in
our determination to craft a fairer and more complete taxation system
despite opposition from business quarters," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Under the current taxation system, Hsieh said, many wealthy
people are not required to pay income taxes because of deficiencies
or flaws in existing tax laws.</P>
      <P>"The government is now determined to plug holes and deficiencies
in our taxation system by introducing a minimum tax scheme which
would require high-income earners' to pay a minimum amount of taxes,"
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>According to finance ministry data, eight of the nation's 40
richest people didn't pay a dime of income tax last year, and 15
others paid less than 1 percent of their annual income.</P>
      <P>Noting that tax reform plans tend to draw opposition from various
social quarters, Hsieh said the Ministry of Finance should focus its
efforts on fleshing out a minimum tax scheme at the moment.</P>
      <P>"At this stage of tax reform, we should give priority to
introducing a minimum tax system while suspending debate on other
reform measures in order to minimize possible backlash, " Hsieh said,
adding that other reform plans aimed at expanding the taxation base
should be discussed in the later stage of reform.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said after the Cabinet meeting
that the government has set two goals for this round of tax reform --
fairness and expansion of taxation base.</P>
      <P>To realize the goal of tax fairness, Cho said, the government
will introduce a minimum tax scheme. As for the goal of expanding tax
base, he said, the priority is to cancel the income tax exemption
privilege to elementary and junior high school teachers and military
personnel. The proposed levy of income taxes on overseas earnings
will not be considered at this stage of tax reform, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will not expand imports of
U.S. beef before any doubts about its safety are cleared, a
spokesman for the Executive Yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai made the remarks in the wake of a report earlier
this month of a suspected case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), or mad cow disease, in the United States. THe case passed all
but one of a battery of BSE tests and was sent to Britain for further
testing. The results are expected in two weeks.</P>
      <P>Several legislators from across the party spectrum have demanded
that the Department of Health (DOH) remove U.S. beef from store
shelves and a reinstatement of a ban on U.S. beef, but Chen Lu-hung,
director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation, said Monday that the
department will only decide on the matter after the British tests
have been completed.</P>
      <P>Cho quoted an instruction from Premier Frank Hsieh that day that
the government will deal with the matter cautiously and that before
the doubts are clarified, the government will not expand
U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>The DOH has asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other
related government agencies to send related information concerning
U.S. beef to Taiwan, Cho added.</P>
      <P>He also said that at present, Taiwan imports boneless beef from
animals under 30 months old that has passed stringent security
examinations, quoting World Organization for Animal Health guidelines
as stating that boneless beef with no other specific dangerous
substances from animals under 30 months of age can be exported even
from BSE-infected areas.</P>
      <P>But he also urged big stores to clearly mark the origin of the
beef sold so that the public can have the option of not choosing it.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all
related products in December 2003 after the discovery in Washington
State of a single BSE case.</P>
      <P>On April 16 this year, Taiwan began to allow imports of U.S.
boneless beef from animals under 30 months of age.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FISHERMEN URGED NOT TO TAKE RADICAL ACTION OVER DISPUTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A government spokesman urged Taiwan's
fishermen Wednesday not to take radical action over fishery disputes
with Japan.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Taiwan and Japan are
expected to hold a 15th round of fishery talks in late June or early
July to address recent fishery disputes in the overlapping waters of
the two countries' exclusive economic zones.</P>
      <P>Both sides have shown sincerity in resolving the disputes through
the bilateral negotiations, Cho noted.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the administration's unwavering determination to
protect fishermen's rights and interests and to safeguard the
nation's economic zone and sovereignty.</P>
      <P>He discouraged the fishermen from taking radical or unhelpful
action such as flying the five-star People's Republic of China banner
or converging to encircle Japanese patrol vessels in disputed waters.
</P>
      <P>To meet the precondition of not affecting the future demarcation
of each other's economic zones, Taiwan and Japan will discuss first
drawing up a joint operations area in the disputed waters in which
fishing boats from the two countries would be allowed to catch fish
under adequate management, according to Cho.</P>
      <P>Nearly 50 fishing boats from Suao, in the eastern Taiwan county
of Ilan, staged a protest June 10 86 nautical miles off Taiwan's
northeastern coast against Japanese patrol vessels that had expelled
Taiwan fishing ships out of an area in which the 200-nautical mile
exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan overlap.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fishing ships have been repeatedly expelled or detained by
Japanese patrol vessels over the past two years after Japan
readjusted and expanded its exclusive economic zone to as close as
some 20 nautical miles off the coasts of Ilan and neighboring Hualien
counties.</P>
      <P>Cho noted that the Executive Yuan has filed a strong protest
against Japan over the controversy via Taiwan's liaison office in
Tokyo and has asked that Taiwan and Japan seek to resolve their
fishing disputes through dialogue in line with international law.</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies from the Cabinet-level Coast Guard
Administration, Cho said that over the past several years, 11 Taiwan
fishing boats have been detained by Japan's Fisheries Agency, all of
which were caught beyond Taiwan's "temporarily demarcated line."</P>
      <P>By comparison, Cho said, 38 Chinese fishing boats were nabbed
during the same period, while 120-odd South Korean fishing boats were
detained.</P>
      <P>Cho added that it is a bad idea that Taiwan fishing boats choose
to fly PRC flag to evade the Japanese patrol boats' crackdown because
more PRC vessels have been busted than those from Taiwan and it would
make it even more difficult for the government to protect the Taiwan
fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Before the 15th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks begin,
Taiwanese fishermen should operate within the area temporarily
demarcated by the government and the Coast Guard Administration will
send patrol ships to fully protect them, Cho added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
(NPSU) politicians lodged a protest Wednesday with the de facto
Japanese embassy in Taiwan over what they called "rude and
unreasonable" treatment received by a group of Taiwan aboriginal
demonstrators in Japan a day earlier.</P>
      <P>The protesters, led by aboriginal Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei of
the NPSU, had planned to demonstrate outside the Yasukuni Shrine in
Tokyo, where their ancestors who fought for the Japanese Imperial
Army during World War II are honored. They are demanding the removal
of the aboriginal soldiers' tablets from the shrine so that their
"spirits can be escorted back to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>They were stopped by Japanese police about 200 meters from the
shrine and prohibited from getting out of their buses.</P>
      <P>To show their support for Kao Chin, NPSU Chairwoman Chang Po-ya,
Legislators Chen Chin-ting and Tsai Hao submitted a letter of protest
to the Taipei office of the Interchange Association of Japan.</P>
      <P>In the letter, the NPSU said the "rude and unreasonable" method
employed by Japanese police in dealing with the matter reminds people
of Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan more than 100 years ago and the
"bullying" endured by the Taiwan people at that time.</P>
      <P>The NPSU also demanded that the Japanese prime minister stop

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei has huge potential for becoming a 
regional and global business operations hub and opening direct 
transport links between Taiwan and China is vital to this aim, Taipei 
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou claimed Wednesday. </P>
      <P>Speaking in a seminar sponsored by a financial magazine, Ma
encouraged the government to set up direct trade, transport and
postal links with China as soon as possible, to help Taipei develop
into a business operation center in the Asia-Pacific region for
foreign investors and an international business operations hub for
Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>Once direct three links are established between Taipei and
Shanghai, businessmen will be able to travel between the two sides in
one day and Taiwan will be given a boost to turn the city into a hub
for the entertainment business and the publishing and manufacturing
industries in East Asia, thanks to Taiwan's central location in the
region, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>He also delivered a report on the city's present development and
its prospects, pointing out that the municipal authorities have
created many business opportunities through cost-effective
build-operate-transfer (BOT) joint ventures with the private sector.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the Neihu technology park racked up an annual 
revenue of more than NT$1.67 trillion (US$53.53 billion) in 2003, 
while the figure for 2004 is expected to reach NT$1.5 trillion, a 
level that has exceeded the scale of the Hsinchu Science-based 
Industrial Park -- Taiwan's most representative facility for hi-tech 
companies. </P>
      <P>The Taipei City Government has a plan to develop a hi-tech
corridor along the Keelung river and to further promote cultural
activities, he said, adding that around 2,600 booths will be added to
an exhibition hall in the Nankang software park next year to attract
a larger number of foreign businessmen.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei is continuing to expand its mass rapid transit 
system and improving its sewerage system, Ma said, voicing the hope 
of making the city a free-travel space in which citizens and visitors 
can easily get to any corner via public transport, and a wireless 
communication network with 10,000 service spots through which users 
can connect to the Internet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CAUCUS TO FILE FOR CGJ RULING OVER OMBUDSMEN APPOINTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will file for a Council of Grand
Justices (CGJ) judgment on the constitutionality of the legislature's
refusal to screen a Control Yuan nomination list, a caucus whip said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The application will be filed Thursday, " William Lai said,
adding that the CGJ will be asked to judge whether the
opposition-controlled Legislative Procedure Committee is eligible to
block a bill from being placed on the legislative agenda without any
"legitimate" reasons.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian referred a list of nominees for the 29
Control Yuan seats, including the supreme watchdog body's presidency
and vice presidency, late last year. The list has so far not been
discussed at the legislative floor because the Legislative Procedure
Committee has refused to put it on the legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>Lai said the legislature's powers should rest in its plenary
session, not any auxiliary committees like the Procedure Committee.</P>
      <P>If the Procedure Committee is allowed to "randomly" block a bill
from being put on the legislative agenda, Lai said, it is tantamount
to allowing the committee to usurp the powers and functions of the
legislative plenary session.</P>
      <P>"By refusing to put a bill on the legislative work agenda, the
Procedure Committee has actually deprived legislators who do not sit
on the Procedure Committee of the right to exchange their views about
the bill at the legislative plenary session, " Lai said, adding that
such a practice would lead to the manipulation of legislative
operations by a few lawmakers and eventually result in an erosion of
the power of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Due to the opposition-controlled legislature's boycott, the
Control Yuan has been moribund since the six-year tenure of the
previous Control Yuan members expired Jan. 31.</P>
      <P>Without new ombudsmen, Lai said the public cannot receive timely
assistance from the Control Yuan when they file petitions. According
to Lai, the Control Yuan has received more than 4,000 appeals in the
past four months, but no ombudsmen are available to handle them,
undermining the rights of the people.</P>
      <P>Under the current political system, Lai said, Control Yuan
members are also required to monitor national examinations. "Their
absence has affected the rights of a number of participants in
various national examinations," he added.</P>
      <P>With the aim of safeguarding the nation's constitutional order,
Lai said the DPP legislative caucus was forced to seek a CGJ ruling
on the constitutionality of the Procedure Committee's repeated
rejection of the Control Yuan nomination list.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Demand for Natural Gas
Brings Big Import Plans, and Objections.

Just as the 19th century was shaped by coal and the 20th century
by oil, people in the energy industry say, this century will belong
to natural gas. International energy companies, the Bush
administration and governments in gas-rich countries are aggressively
championing the creation of a global market for natural gas, with the
United States at its center as the largest importer. They are
promoting the fuel as more plentiful and less polluting than oil and
needed to sustain economic growth. While the United States is already
running low on its own production of natural gas and need to import.
Competition for gas projects has prompted a frenetic race among
international oil companies. However, officials in some states where
energy companies plan to build terminals that would receive the gas
tankers - including Alabama, California, Maine, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, New York and Rhode Island - say they could fall victim to a
catastrophic explosion, either accidental or set by terrorists.

Wall Street Journal: Fast-Aging Japan Keeps Its Elders On the Job
Longer.

With Japan's birth rate declining fast for decades, the pool of
young workers was shrinking. Some manufacturers tried out a source of
labor it had never considered before: the elderly. These
manufacturers are dealing with a problem that's just starting to
sweep the world -- an aging population combined with a shrinking work
force. The problem is unprecedented in modern times, and its most
predictable effect would be to sap economic growth: If a country's
work force declines and higher production per worker doesn't make up
for this, its economy will shrink. Though Japan will run into this
quagmire first, other nations are going to have to deal with it soon
as well. Unlike the U.S., Japan is reluctant to rely on large-scale
immigration to bolster the work force. Instead, it is trying another
strategy: enticing the elderly to work longer before receiving
retirement benefits, effectively dealing with old age by making it
start later.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  15  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of National Defense (MND)
officials said Wednesday the military will cooperate with the Coast
Guard Administration (CGA) to protect Taiwanese fishermen based on
what they called a "non-provocation principle."</P>
      <P>They pointed out that maintaining sea traffic order and
protecting fishery activities are mainly the duties of the CGA and
that the navy plays only a backup role in this regard.</P>
      <P>While the CGA dispatched six patrol boats to support Taiwanese
fishermen during a conflict June 9 with Japanese authorities in a
disputed part of the East China Sea following the latest expulsion of
fishermen from the area, the navy did not step in because the CGA did
not ask, they explained.</P>
      <P>According to navy official Lee Hao, two Knox-class frigates were
on standby 25 nautical miles off the coast on that day and could have
reached the scene in one hour if necessary.</P>
      <P>In addition, three Jin Chiang-class vessels were also available
in Keelung and could have provided rapid backup, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials said naval forces are responsible for
assisting the CGA with the protection of Taiwanese fishermen and that
the navy also assigns three battleships, six complementary frigates
and two anti-submarine planes to patrol in specific areas on a daily
basis to protect the security of the country's territorial waters.</P>
      <P>The patrol scope of the navy's battleships extends beyond 60
nautical miles from the coast, they said.</P>
      <P>However, they continued, it is not appropriate for the military
to position itself on the frontline of international fishery disputes
because this could easily lead to military conflict.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, opposition People First Party Legislator Lin
Yu-fang requested that the military send a Knox-class frigate to
accompany him on a fact-finding trip to an area near the disputed
waters June 17 to flex Taiwan's muscle against Japan. The MND brushed
aside his request.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA ONLY PART OF TAIWAN'S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE MARKET: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian noted Wednesday
that China is only part of the global marketing strategy for Taiwan's
agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while attending a ceremony held at the
Council of Agriculture (COA) to mark the first shipment of Taiwan
papayas to Japan.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government's attitude toward agricultural produce
exports to China will comprise "one principle and three
arrangements."
</P>
      <P>He said the government will promote agricultural exports not only
to China but also to other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>He also said the first arrangement will be that the Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) will be designated as a
window integrating the exports, while local farmers' associations
will coordinate in supplying produce, with TAITRA in charge of global
marketing.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , the COA and related
government agencies will also form negotiation teams and commission
TAITRA to assist them in consulting with China on matters related to
quarantine, tariffs, inspection and customs clearance for
agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>To ensure the quality of Taiwan's high-priced fresh fruit and
speedy transportation, Chen said that it is necessary to speed up
direct cross-strait charter cargo flights based on the "two-way and
non-stop" formula of Chinese New Year charter flights for Taiwan
businessmen operating in China.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that in the wake of China's recent announcement
that it will impose zero tariffs on some Taiwan fruit, the issue has
become a hot topic, although many discussions have not been from the
economic and agricultural perspective but mere political rhetoric.</P>
      <P>He cited COA statistics showing that Taiwan exported only
US$890,000-worth of fresh fruit to China last year. If exports to
Hong Kong were also included, the amount would come to US$7.54
million, or only 1.78 percent of Taiwan's total production value.</P>
      <P>In terms of volume, fresh fruit to China amounted to only 629
tons, although if exports to Hong Kong were included, it would amount
to 16,000 tons, still only 0.6 percent of Taiwan's total production.</P>
      <P>In terms of export price per kilo, Taiwan mangoes exported to
Japan averaged US$3.97 per kilo, compared with only US$0.72 to China.</P>
      <P>"Viewed from every angle, one can see that the importance of the
China market for Taiwan agricultural produce is quite limited, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He said that because of China's deliberate manipulation and "some
Taiwanese political figures singing duets" with Beijing's leaders,
the potential of the China market has been exaggerated, which he
claimed is not only misleading but could also disrupt Taiwan's
efforts to transform and upgrade its agriculture.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's agriculture wants to shine in the world, it has to
pursue "four highs" -- high quality, high value-added, high price and
high return agriculture, he said.</P>
      <P>A sharp increase of low- and medium-priced agricultural produce
to China could be a "short-term plus, but a long-term minus" to the
long-term development of Taiwan's agriculture, he claimed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that Taiwan papayas entering the Japanese market shows that Taiwan
can sell its produce to any country in the world.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when attending a ceremony sponsored by the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) at its headquarters to
mark the sale of Taiwan papayas in Japan -- one of the most stringent
and quality conscious markets in the world -- after eight years of
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Papayas from Taiwan were not allowed to enter the Japanese market
in the past due to the fact that domestically planted papayas were
plagued by a parasitic insect.</P>
      <P>But Japan eventually decided last December to permit imports from
Taiwan that are treated with insecticide at home after Taiwan
authorities proved that they had been successful in developing a new
quarantine technique.</P>
      <P>Japanese buyers ordered 500 metric tons of Taiwan papayas valued
at NT$65 million (US$2.1 million) for the whole of this year as the
peak production season approaches in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Describing Japan as a major barometer for the quality of fruits
and vegetables from Taiwan, the president asserted that the quality,
flavor, sanitation and safety of domestically grown produce has
reached international standards.</P>
      <P>As long as Taiwan is able to sell its products to Japan, it means
that Taiwan can market its goods in any country across the world,
Chen said, stressing that Taiwan farmers must upgrade and transform
to overcome the impact of the domestic market opening to foreign
competition following Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in January 2002.</P>
      <P>Chen proposed that Taiwan's agriculture sector target both the
domestic and overseas markets to widen its profits.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, a Taiwan farmer presented a basket of
papayas to the president, and a Japanese executive handed him a copy
of the purchase order from Japan.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung said that his council is doing its
utmost to help Taiwan growers of guavas, bell fruits and grapefruits
to meet Japanese quarantine requirements in the hope of exploring new
markets for Taiwan's produce.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER ASKS HON HAI TO REVEAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR TAX PURPOSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Chairman
Terry Kuo should follow the lead of such prestigious American
companies as IBM and Intel to make public his company's earnings and
tax returns annually, a lawmaker said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>William Lai, a legislative whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , made the call after Kuo criticized the DPP
administration's plan to implement a system whereby each taxpayer,
including the very wealthy, would have to pay a certain established
percent of their income so that loopholes for the rich can be closed.</P>
      <P>Kuo was quoted as having said at a Hon Hai shareholders' meeting
earlier this week that the government should mull how to enhance
administrative efficiency instead of just considering how to levy
more taxes on rich people.</P>
      <P>"Being rich is not a sin, " Kuo was quoted as having said, adding
that if the government divides the people into rich and poor
categories, the result would be something like a communist regime.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Kuo's remarks, Lai said the proposed "minimum" tax
measure is mainly aimed at making the nation's tax system fairer and
more reasonable.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Lai said, 75 percent of income tax revenues have
come from wage earners with a few high-tech industries enjoying
significant exemptions and deductions.</P>
      <P>Quoting finance ministry data, Lai said eight of the nation's 40
richest people didn't pay one NT dollar of income tax last year, and
15 others paid less than 1 percent of their annual income.</P>
      <P>"The proposed 'minimum' tax scheme should correct this unfair and
unjust practice in line with the principle of social justice, " Lai
said, adding that the planned tax reform would not require rich
people like Kuo to pay more taxes than others but would only require
the rich to pay a reasonable percentage of what they earn.</P>
      <P>Noting that many noted American companies, such as IBM and Intel,
have made public their earnings and tax payments annually, Lai said
he hopes Kuo can follow such a good example.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The entry of 365,000 mainland Chinese
visitors to Taiwan a year is expected to create some 700,000 jobs in
the country, secretary-general Hsu Kao-ching of the Travel Agents
Association of the Republic of China said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the estimate in response to China's offer to lift the
ban on its citizens coming to sightsee in Taiwan, and the estimate
was made based on the ROC Cabinet's plan to allow 1,000 Chinese
tourists into Taiwan each day.</P>
      <P>Judging from the increase of air flights, hotel personnel, travel
buses, restaurants, entertainment parks, tourist agencies and tour
guides resulting from the visits of mainland travelers, Hsu estimated
that each mainland tourist could equate to two job opportunities for
Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a survey from Manpower Taiwan showed that the service
industry will be the booming sector for personnel demand in the third
quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>Among the industry, almost 70 percent of local tourist
enterprises need new employees, which also means more opportunities
for people working in air transport companies, restaurants and
entertainment parks.</P>
      <P>The number of overseas visits by Taiwan people is estimated to
top eight million this year, while the number of visits by foreigners
to Taiwan will reach 3.2 million, according to Hsu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SITS THE FENCE ON ABORIGINAL PROTESTS AT YASUKUNI SHRINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese aboriginal legislator had the
right to try to protest at Japan's controversial Yasukuni Shrine
Tuesday, and it was the prerogative of the Japanese police to stop
them, Premier Frank Hsieh said in Kaohsiung Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The premier was commenting on aboriginal Legislator Kao Chin
Su-mei's attempt to bring back the tablets of the deceased Taiwan
aboriginal conscripts who died fighting for the Japanese Imperial
Army in World War II from the temple dedicated to Japanese war dead.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin asked authorities in Taiwan on Wednesday to complain to
the Japanese for the "rude treatment" that her group received at the
shrine the previous day.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was in Kaohsiung inspecting the damage caused by torrential
rains that drenched the area over the last four days when he remarked
on the incident.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin and her followers, mostly aborigines, claimed that the
aborigines who are listed in the shrine were forced to serve in the
Japanese Imperial Army against their will when Taiwan was ruled by
Japan. She said it is disgraceful for Taiwan aborigines to have their
ancestors honored in a temple set up by a country that invaded
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A number of countries in Asia consider the Yasukuni Shrine a
testament to past Japanese imperialism and it is controversial
because 14 class A war criminals were included in 1978 among the 2.5
million people enshrined at Yasukuni. Compounding the matter is the
fact that various Japanese leaders, including numerous Japanese prime
ministers, have gone to the shrine to pay homage.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh toured flood
devastation in southern Pingtung County Wednesday and said that if a
flood-control project is approved by the Legislative Yuan, the
situation will improve in the coming years.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was briefed by county officials at the hardest hit Shinyuan
township on the worst inundation in 30 years in southern Taiwan. He
was accompanied by Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan and
officials from other government agencies.</P>
      <P>Hsieh promised to fully finance local flood-control projects over
the next three years with a central government, eight-year,
flood-control program worth NT$80 billion (US$2.6 billion) after
various township chiefs decried local authorities' failure to finish
the construction of a revetment along the Tungkang Stream because the
central government budget had run dry.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng, 136 colleges
and elementary and middle schools in southern Taiwan have closed due
to the heavy rainfall brought by a front which is still lingering in
the region.</P>
      <P>Tu expressed grave concern over the possibility of serious
mudslides and rock slides if the front moves northward to Nantou and
Taichung counties, which were devastated by the Sept. 21 earthquake
in 1999 -- the worst quake to hit Taiwan in a century.</P>
      <P>The education ministry will closely monitor the situation in
central Taiwan and offer assistance to local schools to help protect

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday the
government is firm on protecting local fishermen's rights and
safety in the nation's exclusive economic zone.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks after some critics accused the government
of failing to effectively protect local fishermen from being chasing
by Japanese patrol ships from a disputed part of the East China Sea
near the Tiaoyutai Islands, which are claimed by Taiwan, China and
Japan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the government's determination to protect local
fishermen's rights and safety is beyond question.</P>
      <P>"The government will never evade its duty of protecting our
fishermen's rights and safety as well as defending our national
sovereignty and exclusive economic zone," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Coast Guard Administration (CGA) Minister Shu Hwei-you
said the administration has sent large patrol ships to police a
temporarily demarcated divide line which was agreed upon in previous
rounds of talks with Japan.</P>
      <P>"The CGA patrol ships have consistently done their utmost to
protect local fishing boats operating within that line. Before we
reach a final agreement with Japan over the disputed overlapping
parts of the two countries' economic zones, local fishing boats
should refrain from operating beyond the temporary demarcation line
to avoid unnecessary risks," Shu said.</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies compiled by the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency,
Shu said only 11 Taiwan fishing boats have been impounded by Japanese
coast guard patrol vessels since 2000, while 38 Chinese fishing boats
and 102 South Korean fishing ships have been impounded by Japan
during the same period.</P>
      <P>According to CGA investigations, Shu said all of the 11 Taiwan
ships were impounded while operating in waters outside the temporary
demarcation line.</P>

      <P>Taiwan considers China's response to its
initiatives for bilateral talks on two issues "friendly," Cho
Jung-tai, the spokesman for the Executive Yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cho said Beijing didn't turn down Taiwan's initiatives out of
hand; that means the two private organizations asked by the Taiwan
authorities to negotiate with Beijing on two different issues may now
approach their Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said on Monday that his administration has
asked the Taipei Airlines Association and the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) to talk with Beijing on
possible direct charter cargo flights between the two sides and the
export of Taiwan's fruits to the mainland.</P>
      <P>The two private groups were asked to act on behalf of the
government because of Beijing's refusal to have any official contacts
with Taiwan, which would lend credit to Taiwan's claim to be a state.</P>
      <P>A Chinese official in charge of Taiwan affairs said earlier that
day in Beijing that China would like to exchange views with Taiwan on
charter cargo flights although it believes that direct passenger
flights are more urgently needed.</P>
      <P>As to the negotiations on import of Taiwan fruits, the official
said Beijing prefers to talk with the Taiwan Farmers' Association.</P>
      <P>Cho said TAITRA, which has succeeded in selling the first batch
of 500 tons of Taiwan papaya to Japan Wednesday, is capable of
marketing Taiwan's agriculture products.</P>
      <P>The premier also promised on Monday to pick appropriate private

      <P>Noting that science and technology has been the driving force
behind economic development, Chen said progress in the science and
technology field has helped Taiwan ward off a possible industrial
hollowing-out in the face of economic globalization and China's
"magnetic effect" in attracting foreign investment.</P>
      <P>In the future, Chen said, Taiwan should devote even more efforts
to science and technology development because achievements in this
field can serve as ammunition to break the China-imposed diplomatic
embargo and to better safeguard peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"We should use technological power to defend regional peace,
stability and prosperity," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He asked members of the advisory commission to offer counseling
on how to boost self-sufficiency in national defense technology,
encourage industrial technological innovation, establish world-class
brands and construct an index park for creative industries.</P>
      <P>The president also urged all science and technology advisory
panelists to present counseling on measures to cope with the possible
impact on future industrial development of the Kyoto Protocol, a
multilateral agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emmissions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO STUDY STRATEGY IN FISHERY TALKS WITH JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Related government agencies will convene 
a coordination meeting soon to study its strategy in the upcoming
negotiations and how best to protect fishermen's interests, a
spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu said that the time of the 15th Taiwan-Japan fishery
talks will be announced.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks after Japanese government agreed to
convene a new round of fishery talks with Taiwan over disputes
resulting from overlapping economic zones between the two countries,</P>
      <P>MOFA officials noted that four Taiwanese fishing ships were
operating in waters off northeastern Taiwan within the legal boundary
set by the government June 8 when they were chased away by Japanese
patrol ships. Around 50 Taiwan fishing ships later converged in the
nearby waters to stage a protest against Japanese patrol boats.</P>
      <P>The ministry lodged a serious protest June 8. The following day,
the Republic of China deputy representative to Japan, Chen Hung-chi,
delivered a letter of protest to the Interchange Association, which
represents the interests of Japan in the absence of diplomatic ties
between the two countries, and ROC Representative Koh Se-kai also
expressed the government's stance to the Interchange Association that
evening, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The Interchange Association conveyed the protest to the Japanese
government, and Japan agreed to handle the fishery disputes in a
peaceful and rational way and instructed its patrol boats to exercise
caution so as not to heighten tensions and to avoid conformation.</P>
      <P>At issue was the formulation of a Japanese law regarding its
exclusive economic zone and continental shelf in 1996, which includes
part of Taiwan in its 200-mile economic zone.</P>
      <P>Because of complaints by Taiwan about the "unreasonable"
demarcation, the two countries began negotiations in 1996. A total of
14 rounds of fishery negotiations have been conducted as of the end
of last year.</P>

    <TEXT>The Straits Times:Older laid-off workers
get jobs faster.

Older retrenched workers are finding it easier to land jobs, and
even nudging ahead of younger ones in getting re-employed. The latest
employment figures charted this trend, prompting questions on whether
it signals a real change in attitudes of employers and other workers
or is just a temporary blip. Still, their better showing pulled
re-employment levels to an 18-month high, with 68 percent of workers
laid off in the last quarter of 2004 finding new jobs within six
months. The figure for the previous quarter was 57 percent.

The Lianhe Zaobao: Nearly 70% of laid-off workers get jobs in six
months.

The re-employment rate of laid-off workers in the first three
months of this year is 68%. This rate was the highest in over a year.
This was mainly due to an improvement in the re-hiring of mature
workers, according to the Manpower Ministry's Labour Market First

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTER REAFFIRMS MILITARY'S COMMITMENT TO PROTECT FISHERMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The military will continue to support the
Coast Guard Administration's (CGA's) efforts to protect Taiwanese
fishermen and will respond immediately to any situations requiring
military backup, National Defense Minister Lee Jye said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Ministry of National Defense will focus its work on
maintaining security on the seas and will dispatch monitoring naval
frigates to operate within sight of the fishermen in the future.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that the responsibility of protecting fishermen
was transferred from the Navy to the CGA in 2000 and that the
military is now in charge of monitoring and providing backup if
necessary.</P>
      <P>During last week's confrontations between Taiwanese fishermen and
the Japanese coast guard in a disputed part of the East China Sea
where the exclusive economic zones of the two countries overlap, the
Navy was instructed to make the necessary preparations and dispatched
two frigates to nearby waters to monitor the situation there, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>The minister made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan, where he
met with speaker Wang Jin-pyng to discuss the issue of fishermen's
protection.</P>
      <P>Also at the meeting, CGA Director-General Shi Hwei-yow said the
CGA will definitely protect the fishermen if they are operating
within the tentative line dividing the two countries' overlapping
economic zones.</P>
      <P>If the fishermen plan to operate beyond this line, they can apply
for CGA protection and escort through a fishermen's association, Shi
said.</P>
      <P>However, Shi pointed out that the CGA currently only owns 186
patrol ships, with only 13 of these being large-size vessels, which
he said is hardly enough to cope with the CGA's law-enforcement
missions in territorial waters extending 540,000 square kilometers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau
pointed out that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has asked Japan to
arrange for the 15th round of bilateral fishery talks as soon as
possible, which he said hopefully can take place some time between
late June and early July.</P>
      <P>Kau said the ministry also hopes that higher level officials will
be allowed to take part in the talks and that he himself will
participate if necessary.</P>
      <P>Before beginning the talks, the ministry will meet with
representatives of related authorities, fishermen's associations and
the legislature to gather their opinions, he said, adding that the
ministry will take a firm stand to protect the rights and interests
of Taiwanese fishermen.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative
Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng, both vice chairmen of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), will hold two televised platform presentations next
month to explain how they would lead the party if elected chairman,
an aide of Ma said Thursday.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng, one of Ma's chief campaign aides,
made the remarks after agreeing on the terms of the presentations the
same day with representatives of Wang's camp at KMT headquarters.</P>
      <P>There will be no debating or question-and-answer sections during
their encounters on television, although Ma had hoped to be able to
debate with Wang to allow KMT members to gain a detailed
understanding of their ideas, Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the two sides agreed to hold two televised
platform presentations July 2 and July 9, in which each Ma and Wang
will be given an hour to elaborate on their policies and how to guide
the party if elected. The vote for chairman will be made through a
direct vote among party members and is set for July 16.</P>
      <P>There will be more than 580 polling stations for KMT members to
cast their ballots, Wu said. The winner will take over the post from
incumbent Chairman Lien Chan, who is slated to step down in August.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang launched a new publicity campaign targeting
around 180,000 members of the KMT's Huangfushing Chapter -- most of
whom are retired military veterans and their families.</P>
      <P>A new booklet that Wang said he will mail to every Huangfushing
member stresses Wang's firm stance against Taiwan independence and
his opposition to a change of Taiwan's official designation of the
Republic of China and to the abolishment of the ROC Constitution.</P>
      <P>Wang told a group of reporters that he must make his stance
clearly known to the rest of the KMT members in the face of rampant
speculation over his links to former President Lee Teng-hui, who also
served as a KMT chairman but who now is the spiritual leader of the
pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS URGES EARLY CROSS-STRAIT TALKS ON DIRECT LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislative
caucus on Thursday called for the government to engage in early talks
with China on cross-strait charter cargo and passenger flights.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of KMT's Policy Committee
and KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao made the appeal one day after a
spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Office said in Beijing that Taiwan
should agree to designate private organizations to communicate and
arrange for direct cross-strait charter passenger flights. China is
also willing to exchange views on cross-strait charter cargo flights,
the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that since President Chen Shui-bian first came to
power in 2000, he has made direct cross-strait transportation links a
major policy goal, but he has been unable to make headway on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Now that governments of both sides of the Strait have extended
goodwill toward each other, the government on Taiwan should seize the
opportunity to bring about cross-strait charter passenger and cargo
flights, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Using three million visits across the Taiwan Strait each year as
an estimate, Tseng said that direct passenger flights could save
NT$50 billion (US$1.58 billion) , while charter cargo flights could
save NT$30 billion each year.</P>
      <P>In addition to direct transportation links, Tseng also urged
early cross-strait talks on matters concerning Chinese tourists
coming to Taiwan and Taiwan fruit exports to China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a KMT spokesman said Thursday the party hopes that
cross-strait charter passenger and cargo flights will not only be a
slogan, but will be translated into action.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung said that China favors cross-strait charter
passenger flights, while Taiwan has put the emphasis on charter cargo
flights, and if both sides stick to their guns, then consultations
will not be possible.</P>
      <P>Saying that KMT Chairman Lien Chan has advocated direct
cross-strait charter passenger and cargo flights, he said that the
party is willing to help promote the issue.</P>

      <P>The DPP also hopes to put on the agenda the budget for a NT$480

      <P>Chao Yung-ching, convener of the DPP legislative caucus, pointed
out that the flood-control project was put forth by Premier Frank
Hsieh soon after his inauguration in February and is not targeted
only at the recent flooding in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The project is aimed at resolving the flooding problem at the
source by improving regional flood-prevention facilities, Chao said.</P>
      <P>Taking the opportunity of the recent flooding, Hsieh repeated a
day earlier his call for the legislature to hold a special session to
pass the special statute so that the project could start in January
next year.</P>
      <P>However, Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng has expressed his
disapproval of Hsieh's proposal and said there is still at least
NT$19.3 billion at the Cabinet's disposal for flood aid and
prevention.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party

      <P>Metal manufacturers are eager to launch
production lines for equipment used in generating electricity from
wind power to cash in on the emerging market for renewable energy,
according to the Metal Industries Research and Development Center

      <P>MIRDC officials said Thursday that with the Kyoto Protocol having

is adjusting the country's energy structure and promoting actively
the development of renewable energy, such as wind, water, solar and
geothermal.</P>
      <P>Among these, wind power is the one with the largest potential and
could account for 35 percent of the total renewable energy of the
country in 2010, the officials added.</P>
      <P>The MIRDC experts estimated that the domestic demand for
equipment used for generating electricity from wind power will reach

the conditions and qualifications of Taiwan residents working in
China, he said that the sense of Taiwan's identity will only
be higher with increased cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>The premier said this is a time when "talented people are looking
for the right place to work, " not the other way around, adding that
increased cross-strait exchanges will reinforce the people's
happiness at being in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On criticism by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) of his proposed
eight-year, NT$80 billion (US$2.54 billion) flood-control project, he
said that this may be because of some misunderstanding on KMT
Chairman Lien Chan's part.</P>
      <P>He said he hoped to meet with Lien to explain the project.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROFESSIONAL DELEGATION TO HELP TAIWAN TEXTILE-MAKERS IN AFRICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A deluge of low-priced cloth and apparel
from China to the rest of the world has affected the textile industry
in Africa, and the government will send a professional group to help
Taiwan textile makers there overcome their business difficulties, a
government official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Teh-yang, deputy director-general of the African Affairs
Department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told a news
conference that a delegation composed of experts recommended by
government agencies will visit textile makers from Taiwan operating
in Lesotho, Malawi, South Africa and Swaziland in early July and
provide them with suggestions on how to take on China's challenge.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the ministry will approve the name list of the
specialists to be fielded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
Bureau of Foreign Trade and the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council.</P>
      <P>The removal of a world quota system on textile products early
this year has led to a surge of cheaper textile exports from China to
the European Union and the United States -- prompting its two major
trading partners to impose limits on Chinese exports.</P>
      <P>The textile industry in Africa, where many investors from Taiwan
are operating, has also been dealt a blow indirectly, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Compared with the E. U. and the U. S., it is much more difficult
for African countries to resist the situation due to their more
primitive technologies, he explained. But he pointed out that many
countries on the continent have begun to address the issue out of a
strong fear that foreign investment might flow out of their
hard-earned textile industry.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, the South African government has sought to
talk over the issue with China after coming under fire from its trade
and textile associations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CAUCUS FILES FOR GRAND JUSTICES' RULING ON OMBUDSMEN APPOINTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took the Control Yuan problem to
the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Thursday, asking for a judgment
on the constitutionality of the legislature's repeated refusal to
screen the president's list of nominees for the supreme watchdog
body.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chao Yung-ching, who concurrently heads the DPP
legislative caucus, filed the petition with the CGJ in the company of
several other DPP lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Judicial Yuan Secretary-General Fan Kuang-chun said after
accepting the petition that the CGJ will give its ruling in
accordance with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chao said the legislative caucuses of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP)
have abused their majority status in the Legislative Procedure
Committee to block the nomination list from being placed on the
legislative work agenda for more than half a year.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian referred a list of nominees for the 29
Control Yuan seats, including the supreme watchdog body's presidency
and vice presidency, late last year. The list has so far not been
discussed at the legislative floor because the Legislative Procedure
Committee has refused to put it on the legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>"We are forced to file for a CGJ ruling in an effort to safeguard
the sanctity of our constitutional order and highlight the absurdity
of the opposition-controlled Legislative Procedure Committee's
manipulation of legislative operations," Chao said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator William Lai said the legislature's powers should
rest in its plenary session, not any auxiliary committees like the
Procedure Committee.</P>
      <P>If the Procedure Committee is allowed to "randomly" block a bill
from being put on the legislative agenda, Lai said, it is tantamount
to allowing the committee to usurp the powers and functions of the
legislative plenary session.</P>
      <P>"By refusing to put a bill on the legislative work agenda, the
Procedure Committee has actually deprived legislators who do not sit
on the Procedure Committee of the right to exchange their views about
the bill at the legislative plenary session, " Lai said, adding that
such a practice would lead to the manipulation of legislative
operations by a few lawmakers and eventually result in an erosion of
the power of the legislature as well as hindrances to overall
government functions.</P>
      <P>Due to the opposition-controlled legislature's boycott, the
Control Yuan has been moribund since the six-year tenure of the
previous Control Yuan members expired Jan. 31.</P>
      <P>Without new ombudsmen, Lai said the public cannot receive timely
assistance from the Control Yuan when they file petitions. According
to Lai, the Control Yuan has received more than 4,000 appeals in the
past four months, but no ombudsmen are available to handle them,
undermining the rights of the people.</P>
      <P>Under the current political system, Lai said, Control Yuan
members are also required to monitor national examinations. "Their
absence has affected the rights of a number of participants in
various national examinations," he added.</P>

      <P>Hsieh said the government will soon open a new round of fishery

    <HEADLINE>FISHERY DISPUTE IS NOT AFFECTING ROC-JAPAN TIES: FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The latest fishery dispute between Taiwan
and Japan has not had an adverse impact on the two countries' close
bilateral ties, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the recent disputes over fishing operations in the
overlapping economic zones of the two countries has become a
high-profile issue among Taiwan's official, private and media
sectors.</P>
      <P>As a result, he said, a new strength has emerged in the country,
a development which has forced Japan to face the issue and return to
the negotiating table with Taiwan, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan and Japan are expected to hold a 15th round
of fishery talks in Tokyo in late June or early July to address the
disputes through bilateral negotiations in a peaceful and rational
manner.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture will be
representing Taiwan at the fishery talks, while the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs will sign a new fishery agreement with Japan on
behalf of the Republic of China government if consensus is reached at
the meeting, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Taiwan-Japan fishery talks would be a complicated
endeavor involving affairs governed by the Coast Guard
Administration, the Ministry of National Defense and the Council of
Agriculture, Chen said that the issue is not expected to be tackled
alone by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he noted that controversies arising from disputed
economic zones, such as the area in the East China Sea and south of
Okinawa, and the sovereignty issue over the Tiaoyutai Islands, known
in Japan as the Senkaku Islands, where China, Taiwan and Japan all
claim sovereignty, have been discussed in all the past 14 rounds of
fishery talks with Japan.</P>
      <P>During all of the fishery talks, he added, Taiwan insisted that
the Tiaoyutais are part of the sovereign territory of the Republic of
China on Taiwan, that Taiwan fishermen's rights and interests must
not be compromised, that controversies must be addressed through
peaceful and rational negotiations, and that Taiwan will not
collaborate with China for any settlement over such disputes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will remain firm over these resolutions in the upcoming
15th round of fishery talks with Japan, Chen said. Nevertheless, he
added, it is indeed hard to foresee how these controversies will be
settled and he would not speculate as to whether more discussions
would be needed in the future.</P>
      <P>Nearly 50 fishing boats from Suao, in the eastern Taiwan county
of Ilan, protested June 10 in waters 86 nautical miles off Taiwan's
northeastern coast against Japanese patrol vessels that had expelled
Taiwan fishing ships out of an area in which the 200-nautical mile
exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan overlap.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fishing ships have been repeatedly expelled or detained by
Japanese patrol vessels over the past two years after Japan
readjusted and expanded its exclusive economic zone to as close as
some 20 nautical miles off the coasts of Ilan and neighboring Hualien
counties.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has filed a strong protest against Japan over
the controversy via Taiwan's liaison office in Tokyo and has asked
that Taiwan and Japan seek to resolve their fishing disputes through
dialogue in line with international law.</P>
      <P>According to tallies from the Cabinet-level Coast Guard
Administration, 11 Taiwan fishing boats have been detained by Japan's
Fisheries Agency over the past two years, all of which were caught
beyond Taiwan's "temporarily demarcated line."</P>
      <P>By comparison, CGA officials said, 38 Chinese fishing boats were
nabbed during the same period, while 120-odd South Korean fishing
boats were detained.</P>
      <P>Before the 15th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks begin,
Taiwanese fishermen have been asked by the coast guard to operate
within the area temporarily demarcated by the government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Suao Fishermen's Association reported last week
that a total of 13 Suao fishing boats have been seized by Japan while
operating in Taiwan's economic zone since 2001, and the boat owners
or families of the fishermen have had to pay for their release.</P>
      <P>An association official said that overlapping economic zones and
fishing rights being encroached upon are long-standing problems, and
if the government is unable to solve them, the fishermen could stage
an even bigger protest next time.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Laywers Fought U.S. Move
to Curb Tobacco Penalty.

Senior U.S. Justice Department officials overrode the objections
of career lawyers running the government's tobacco racketeering trial
and ordered them to reduce the penalties sought at the close of the
nine-month trial by US$120 billion. The trial team argued that the
mov e would be seen as politically motivated and legally groundless.
Two top lawyers for the tria l team, Sharon Y. Eubanks and Stephen D.
Brody, wrote in a memorandum on May 30 to Associate Attorney General
Robert D. McCallum that the lower penalty recommendation ordered by
McCallum would weaken the department's position in any possible
settlement with the industry and "create an incentive for defendants
to engage in future misconduct by making the misconduct profitable."

Wall Street Journal: Chain Reaction, North Korea Sparks
Proliferation Fears Throughout Asia.

If all goes as planned, the the Rokkasho project, facility within
sight of Japan's northern Pacific coast, will begin separating
plutonium from highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. At full
capacity, the plant will produce about nine tons of plutonium a year.
That's enough to meet 10 percent of Japan's civilian nuclear-fuel
needs -- or to make 1,000 nuclear warheads. In a region already
fearful of North Korea's nuclear-weapons ambitions, the Rokkasho
project is adding to the anxiety. Arms-control experts and some U.S.
officials warn that if North Korea tests an atomic bomb, Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan might reconsider their pledges not to develop
nuclear weapons. This trio of American allies possesses more than
enough technical expertise, and Asian history supplies considerable

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian stands by his
determination to put forth a constitution that fits Taiwan by 2008
and the second phase of constitutional reforms will be launched when
conditions are ripe, Presidential Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks during a tea party with reporters in which he
detailed the direction and steps of the task set by the president.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the president stands firm on his promise to create
a "timely, adequate and tailor-made" constitution for Taiwan by 2008
before he steps down from the presidency, Yu said that a
constitution amending committee will be set up under the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>But there will be no fixed timetable for its establishment and
the panel will be set up only when the opposition parties are willing
to throw their full support behind the task, he explained, adding
that its formation requires the participation of all walks of life.</P>
      <P>To obtain this aim, a task force under the Presidential Office
will be devoted to the founding of a constitutional amendment
alliance in the private sector, the cultivating of talent and the
setting up of groups committed to study and research on
constitutional reform, he said.</P>
      <P>He called on the opposition parties not to overlook the
significance of the second phase of constitutional revisions to
Taiwan's long-term development and sustainable growth as a democratic
nation and reminded them of their obligations to the people and to
history.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that a constitution suited to Taiwan will
be put in place by 2008 through democratic participation by the whole
of society, and urged the public to have vision and in-depth thinking
on a new round of constitutional reforms to make Taiwan a great
country.</P>
      <P>Chen announced his ambition to introduce a new round of
constitutional reforms after the last and now-abolished National
Assembly approved a package of constitutional amendments June 7.</P>
      <P>Yu said last week that the second round of constitutional reforms
will not touch on sensitive political issues but will deal with more
practical issues, such as the government system and the military
conscription system.</P>
      <P>But the opposition camp, including the main opposition
Kuomintang, the People First Party and even the Taiwan Solidarity
Union, an ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, have all
voiced disagreement with Chen's idea, on the grounds that the
government should focus on improving Taiwan's economy and the
people's livelihoods instead of engaging in political mobilization.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China is using every way other than
military means to zero in on the United States "like in a game of
go," a China hand and strategic expert claimed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, a professor at Tamkang University and executive
director of the Foundation on International and Cross-Strait Studies,
made the remarks in the wake of recent remarks by U.S. Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that China's increased military expenditure
has raised tensions over Taiwan and concern about its longer term
implications for U.S. forces in the Western Pacific.</P>
      <P>Lin said, echoing former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell,
that although China's military is growing rapidly, it lags 10 years
behind the United States and cannot possibly threaten the U.S. in the
short term.</P>
      <P>He said the United States should take heed instead that China has
adopted economic, cultural and diplomatic methods to boost its
international influence.</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing's strategy is to promote in stages domestic,
diplomatic and defense policy and its policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China might not have swayed the U.S. status globally but it will
change the whole situation in its "final move, " Lin claimed, using
the ancient strategy game go as an analogy.</P>
      <P>Lin, who has served as vice national defense minister and vice
Mainland Affairs Council chairman, said that China's People's
Liberation Army has in recent years attached greater importance to
the "wisdom of the ancestors" and has taken cues from the strategy
classic "The Art of War" by Sun Zu.</P>
      <P>To prove its claim of "peaceful emergence, " China is using its
stunning economic strength accumulated over the past decade to
generously invest in other countries or provide economic assistance,
gradually accumulating more and more diplomatic clout.</P>
      <P>He cited as examples that the tourism markets of Pacific island
states, in which European and American tourists used to predominate,
are now taken over by Chinese tourists with spending power. "China
fever" has taken over from "China fear" in Southeast Asian countries
and long-term allies of the United States such as the European Union
and Australia are at odds with the U.S. because they do not see
eye-to-eye with the U.S. on lifting an arms embargo on China or
policy toward Taiwan, he went on.</P>
      <P>This, he claimed, shows that China's economic might is gradually
undermining U.S. influence over other countries.</P>
      <P>Beijing has also pulled out all the stops to promote Chinese
culture, he said, adding that it is systematically promoting Chinese
learning in other countries and that its missions in the U.S. are
contacting high school principles to offer free Chinese teaching
materials.</P>
      <P>Such efforts have borne fruit, Lin said, claiming that Chinese
has become the priority choice of students learning foreign languages
and that simplified Chinese characters have taken over from
traditional Chinese characters as the language medium.</P>
      <P>At the same time, China also has a "resource diplomacy" ace up
its sleeve, which is to buy large amounts of resources, using "oil
diplomacy," "mineral diplomacy" and "timber diplomacy" to woo African
countries and Latin American countries.</P>

      <P>Police said Thursday they had stepped up

a disputed area of the East China Sea north of Taiwan, while a group
of Taiwan Aborigines, headed by aboriginal Legislator Kao Chin
Su-mei, was forced to cancel a protest in Tokyo Tuesday over the
enshrinement of their relatives at the controversial Yasukuni Shrine
after being blocked by police outside the shrine.</P>
      <P>Police said they will trace the vandals' identities and ascertain
their motivation for their actions.</P>
      <P>To ensure the JIA's security, police said they will strengthen
patrols in the region from late night through the early morning
hours.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel
Lu said Taiwan's representative office in Japan is checking with
Japanese authorities as to whether Japanese police exceeded their
authority by barring Kao Chin's group and accompanying Taiwan
journalists from getting off their tour bus near the Yasukuni Shrine
in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The police wanted to avoid violence between the Taiwanese and a
group of Japanese right-wingers who went to the shrine to confront
them, but if the police indeed exceeded their authority, Lu said, the
government will lodge a protest with the Japanese authorities.</P>
      <P>Kao Chi's mission, composed of about 50 relatives of the
Taiwanese Aborigines who were drafted into the Japanese army and died
during World War II, want the names of the deceased removed from
memorial plaques at the shrine because it also honors convicted
Japanese war criminals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AGRICULTURAL DAMAGE DUE TO DOWNPOUR EXCEEDS NT$1.4 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh Thursday promised
farmers in Yunlin County who have sustained tremendous damage caused
by downpours that have entered a sixth day that compensation and
subsidies will be paid in 10 days to help tide them over their
difficulties.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also renewed calls for the Legislative Yuan to prioritize a
bill for an eight-year, NT$80 billion (US$2.539 billion)
flood-control project if it convenes an extra session next month.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks when he made an inspection tour of the
south-central county of Yunlin to see at first hand the damage
brought about in recent days by flash flooding.</P>
      <P>Several legislators from across the political spectrum who
traveled with the premier on the fact-finding tour expressed worry
over the government's resolve to help the flood victims, saying that
if the government did not deliver on its promise in 10 days, they
will give Hsieh and relevant agencies a hard time.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) reported that
damage caused by flash floods around the country have continued to
expand, with the agriculture sector bearing the brunt, suffering
damage worth over NT$1.4 billion (US$45.16 million) as of Thursday
afternoon.</P>
      <P>Most of the damage was centered in southern Taiwan, especially
Pingtung, Kaohsiung, Tainan, Chiayi and Yunlin counties, where
low-lying areas have been inundated.</P>
      <P>Of the damage, crops had sustained damage exceeding NT$600
million, with some 34,790 hectares of rice paddies and peanut, green
vegetable, watermelon, corn and papaya plantations inundated, COA
officials reported.</P>
      <P>The husbandry sector had suffered damage worth about NT$180
million, with over 10,000 head of pigs, 143,000 chickens and many
other animals and poultry killed.</P>
      <P>In the southern county of Tainan, about half of its townships and
rural townships had been inundated, with floodwater about 1 meter
high in Yukang, Chinghu and Kunchiang villages in Peimen township.</P>
      <P>Soldiers have been sent to help evacuate or rescue affected
residents in six rural townships around Tainan County, where 28
bridges had become impassable, according to COA authorities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Disaster Prevention and Relief Center
reported that as of midnight Wednesday, 433 people had been rescued
and 2,297 people evacuated islandwide.</P>

great concern over human and property losses caused by the recent
flooding in southern Taiwan, Presidential Secretary-General Yu

      <P>Yu revealed that at a regular Thursday meeting, Premier Frank
Hsieh reported to Chen on the progress of post-disaster rescue

</P>
      <P>According to Yu, Chen expressed deep concern and Hsieh promised
to make an eight-year NT$80 billion (US$2.54 billion) flood-control

      <P>The flood-control budget bill is the product of thorough
consideration of the Cabinet and he dismissed opposition claims that
it is a rushed plan, Yu said.</P>
      <P>The flooding had claimed the lives of several people in southern
area and had caused NT$1.4 billion-worth agricultural losses as of
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Cabinet Spokesman Cho Jung-tai, the central

    <HEADLINE>NAVY FRIGATE TO FERRY LAWMAKERS TO INSPECT ROC FISHING GROUNDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
agreed Thursday to send a frigate June 21 to waters near a disputed
part of the East China Sea to allow lawmakers to inspect first hand
how the administration is protecting Taiwan fishermen there,
according to a military spokesman.</P>
      <P>Liu Chih-chien confirmed that after a closed-door meeting among
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Minister of National Defense
Lee Jye and opposition People First Party Legislator Lin Yu-fang, it
was decided that the navy will deploy a frigate on an inspection
voyage, with Wang, Lee and Lin aboard, to show support for the
country's fishermen as well as proclaim Republic of China sovereignty
over its 200-nautical mile economic zone.</P>
      <P>The MND turned down a day earlier a request by Lin that the navy
send a Knox-class frigate June 17 to the disputed area of the East
China Sea where the exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan
overlap, to flex Taiwan's muscle against Japan.</P>
      <P>Liu said Wednesday that the military had no plans to do that
because most available military forces have been deployed to take
part in the "Hankuang 21" exercises.</P>
      <P>Liu said the three frigates already deployed by the military near
the disputed waters should be sufficient to serve the purpose.</P>
      <P>Lin, a co-convener of the legislature's National Defense
Committee, made the request in the wake of a conflict last week in
waters off Taiwan's northeast coast between Taiwanese fishermen and
the Japanese coast guard following the latest expulsion of Taiwanese
fishermen from the area.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that Japan is "much more polite" to Chinese and South
Korean fishermen operating in the same waters and does not dare
arbitrarily expel them.</P>
      <P>Blaming the situation on what he claimed is the "long-time
cowardice" of the government, Lin urged the military to get tough
with Japan to boost Taiwan's leverage, especially when both countries
are set to open a new round of fishery talks in July.</P>
      <P>Lin also threatened to continue to block the ministry's NT$480
billion U.S. arms procurement package and to cut the ministry's
annual budget by at least NT$50 billion if the MND refused to provide
him with a Knox-class frigate for the trip.</P>
      <P>Nearly 50 fishing boats from Suao, in the eastern Taiwan county
of Ilan, protested June 10 in waters 86 nautical miles off Taiwan's
northeastern coast against Japanese patrol vessels that had expelled
Taiwan fishing ships from the disputed area.</P>
      <P>The Suao Fishermen's Association reported last week that a total
of 13 Suao fishing boats have been seized by Japan while operating in
Taiwan's economic zone since 2001 and that the boat owners or
families of the fishermen have had to pay for their release.</P>
      <P>An association official said that overlapping economic zones and
fishing rights being encroached upon are long-standing problems, and
that if the government is unable to solve them, the fishermen could
stage an even bigger protest next time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC TAKES CHINA'S RESPONSE AS HARBINGER OF RESUMED TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is willing to regard China's initial
response to its initiatives for bilateral talks on two matters of
mutual concern as a harbinger of China's willingness to return to the
negotiating table, a senior official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu made the
remarks while meeting with a visiting delegation from the Czech
Republic's Senate foreign affairs and defense committees.</P>
      <P>"As Beijing didn't turn down our initiatives outright, we would
like to consider its response a harbinger of Beijing's willingness to
resume dialogue across the Taiwan Strait," Wu told his guests.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday that the government has asked the
Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) and the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) to talk with Beijing on the opening of
direct cross-strait charter cargo flights and the sale of Taiwan
fruit to China.</P>
      <P>The two private groups were asked to act on behalf of the
government because of Beijing's refusal to have any official contacts
with Taiwan, which would lend credit to Taiwan's claim to be an
independent sovereign state.</P>
      <P>A Chinese official in charge of Taiwan affairs said Wednesday in
Beijing that China would like to exchange views with Taiwan on
charter cargo flights even though it believes direct passenger
flights are more urgently needed.</P>
      <P>As to the negotiations on imports of Taiwan fruit, the official
said Beijing would prefer to talk with the Taiwan Provincial Farmer's
Association. But he did not rule out the possibility of accepting
TAITRA as an intermediary.</P>
      <P>"We hope China can make a clearer and more definite response so
that the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue can start soon, " Wu
said.</P>
      <P>During their talks, the Czech parliamentarians said they look
forward to seeing China move toward democracy after achieving an
economic boom.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said the government-funded Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy, which was established two years ago, is cooperating with
non-government organizations in the United States and European
countries to promote democratic development around the world.</P>
      <P>Wu said he hopes China can lift its ban on Taiwan media outlets'
online versions. Should that be the case, he said, those online
newspapers could become the best channels for Chinese citizens to
understand Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The nation's top mainland policy planner further said he is
hopeful that China can negotiate with Taiwan on technical details for
Chinese citizens to make sightseeing trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We are willing to open our doors to Chinese people so that they
can experience Taiwan's democratic way of life, sowing the seeds of
liberal democracy in their minds," Wu added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMERICAN BEEF '100 PERCENT SAFE': AIT CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The top U.S. representative in Taipei
assured Taiwan consumers Thursday that American beef is very safe and
free from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) , also known as mad
cow disease.</P>
      <P>Douglas Paal, director of the Taipei Office of the American
Institute in Taiwan, tucked into a dish of American beef at the
opening of a four-day international food show at the Taipei World
Trade Center, insisting that American beef is completely safe to eat.</P>
      <P>"While there has been a lot of media attention on the safety of
(U.S.) beef this week, the simple fact is that American beef exported
to Taiwan has been and continues to be 100 percent safe," Paal said.</P>
      <P>The de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan said he was pleased that
American beef is back on the menu in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The return of American beef after a 15-month absence from the
Taiwan market demonstrates the excellent working relationship and
cooperation that exists between Taiwan authorities and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture," Paal said.</P>
      <P>Noting that agricultural and food trade between Taiwan and the
United States has a long history, Paal said the United States has
been Taiwan's largest agricultural import source and one of Taiwan's
most important farm produce export outlets. The United States
accounted for 10 percent of Taiwan's total food exports last year.</P>
      <P>According to Paal, the American pavilion at the 2005 Food Taipei
trade fair features 84 exhibition booths displaying a wide variety of
foodstuffs, including beef.</P>
      <P>Paal gave a thumbs-up after tucking into his beef before the
cameras, saying: "American beef is very very safe, 100 percent safe
and delicious."</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef imports in December 2003 after the United
States reported its first case of BSE, which has been linked to a
variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, a disease that has
claimed more than 140 lives worldwide, mostly in Britain.</P>
      <P>On April 16 this year, Taiwan began to allow imports of U.S.
boneless beef from animals under 30 months of age, but the Department
of Health said Monday it will reinstate a ban on U.S. beef imports if
the United States confirms it has found a second BSE case.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Count will give a ruling Friday
on an appeal filed by defeated presidential candidate Lien Chan and
his running mate James Soong to nullify the re-election of President
Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, court officials said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong appealed to the Supreme Court after their lawsuit
to contest the results of the election was rejected by the Taiwan
High Court Nov. 4 last year.</P>
      <P>They alleged that the results of last year's March 20 election
were swayed by various electoral scandals, a referendum held on the
same day of the election and the activation of a national security
mechanism following the election-eve shooting of Chen and Lu that
they claim barred a number of police and military servicemen from
going to the polls. They have provided no evidence to support their
claims.</P>
      <P>The Chen-Lu ticket won over the Lien-Soong ticket by a margin of
29,518 ballots, or 0.228 percent of the more-than 13 million ballots
cast. A later vote recount reduced the margin by nearly 4,000 to

    <TEXT>Manila Bulletin: GMA vows to
finish economic reforms

Facing the toughest ordeal of her four-year-old
administration, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo
yesterday acknowledged that "agents of
destabilization" are exploiting her sagging popularity
in a last-ditch effort to grab power because "it is
now or never for them."

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Arroyo: 'They are
going too far'

BUOYED by a positive report on the economic front,
President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo yesterday went on
the offensive against her political opponents,
accusing them of making a last-ditch effort to derail
her development goals now that she is on the verge of
achieving them and vowing she would not be deterred.

The Philippine Star: GMA won't face House probe

President Arroyo said yesterday she will not
appear before any congressional probe into the
controversial recordings that purportedly document her
attempts to rig the results of last year's
presidential election.

The Manila Times: Seized guns linked to
destabilization

A shipment of high-powered firearms, ammunition
and gun parts believed to be intended for groups
planning to overthrow the government was intercepted
Thursday by Customs agents at the Manila International
Container Port.</TEXT>

      <P>The Dalai Lama said Thursday in Berlin that
China's fierce opposition has led him not to visit Taiwan during the
past few years.</P>
      <P>The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader made the comments while
responding to questions raised by Taiwanese reporters at a press

      <P>He told more than 100 journalists attending the press gathering
that he visited Taiwan twice before and that the island has made
remarkable cultural and economic achievements.</P>
      <P>Expressing his admiration for Taiwan's efforts in preserving the
tradition of Chinese Buddhism, the Dalai Lama said that maintaining
the island's democracy and freedom is a responsibility of the
international community.</P>
      <P>Revealing that Beijing has fiercely opposed any visits by him to
Taiwan, the Dalai Lama said that as he represents the 6 million
people of Tibet and in order to continue to be able to hold talks

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Swedish Parliament on Thursday adopted
a statement by a vote of 198-102 to express its opposition to a
lifting of the European Union's arms embargo against China.</P>
      <P>The E.U. imposed the arms sales ban shortly after the Tiannmen
Square Massacre in 1989.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing in the statement that maintaining the ban can express
the E.U.'s concern about China's human rights, the Swedish lawmakers
said a lifting of the ban would be against Europe's strategic
interests. Furthermore, the statement said, there is currently no
reliable way to prevent China from transferring advanced weapons
technology to "irresponsible regimes."</P>
      <P>China's continuous intimidation and threats toward Taiwan and the
recent enactment of the Anti-Secession Law by the Chinese
National People's Congress have made the E.U., the United States and
Japan worry about stability in the Asia-Pacific region, the statement
also said, adding that therefore, the E.U. should not lift the ban at
the present time.</P>
      <P>The E.U. must enact a stricter "Code of Conduct" to regulate
its member states' arms exports to third countries in order to
achieve the goal of protecting human rights and regional stability as
well as strengthening relations with friendly nations. it also said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal by
defeated presidential candidate Lien Chan and his running mate James
Soong to nullify the re-election of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu because the plaintiffs have failed to
substantiate their claim, the presiding judge said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong alleged that the outcome of last year's March 20
election was influenced by various electoral scandals, a referendum
held on the day of the election and the activation of a "national
security mechanism" following the election-eve shooting of Chen and
Lu that Lien and Soong claimed prevented a number of police and
military servicemen from going to the polls.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu Chao-hsiung, presiding judge of the case, it was
the Central Election Commission rather than the president that had
the authority to decide whether the referendum was to be held
alongside the presidential election.</P>
      <P>On the activation of the "national security mechanism, " Hsu said
the Ministry of National Defense was only exercising its duty and
that even if extra military servicemen were asked to stay at their
posts, there is no evidence showing that this was ordered by Chen and
Lu.</P>
      <P>While Lien and Soong could not prove that the March 19 shooting
was set up by Chen and Lu to give them an advantage in the election,
Chen and Lu were not the operators of underground radio stations that
Lien and Soong alleged had falsely accused the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of being responsible for the shooting, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Also, the results of a recount ordered by the Taiwan High Court
last year supported the re-election of Chen and Lu, he added.</P>
      <P>The Chen-Lu ticket won the election by a slim margin of only
29,518 votes, or 0.228 percent of the more than 13 million ballots

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Supreme Court's rejection of an appeal
by defeated presidential candidate Lien Chan and his running mate
James Soong to nullify the re-election of President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu triggered mixed responses from the two
camps Friday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office officials said Chen and Lu fully respect the
ruling and hope their opponents and the general public will also
respect the judiciary.</P>
      <P>However, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party
(PFP), which Lien and Soong represent, called the outcome regrettable
and disappointing.</P>
      <P>Accusing the Supreme Court of yielding to political interference
and considerations, KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung claimed the ruling
was made in the absence of justice and conscience.</P>
      <P>Chang urged Chen to support the "truth investigation commission"
aimed at probing the election-eve shooting of the president and vice
president, to clarify opposition "pan-blue alliance" doubts over the
outcome of last year's March 20 election.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong alleged that the election outcome was swayed by
various electoral scandals, a referendum held on the same day of the
election and the activation of a "national security mechanism"
following the shooting that they claimed prevented a number of police
and military servicemen from going to the polls. They have provided
no evidence to support their claims.</P>
      <P>Lai Shyh-bao, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, claimed the
ruling was foreseeable because the Supreme Court did not conduct a
comprehensive recount, while the government has refused to cooperate
with the "truth investigation commission."</P>
      <P>Agreeing with Lai, PFP legislators said the ruling is very
unconvincing and proposed that Lien and Soong file for an
extraordinary appeal on the case.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-General Lee
Yi-yang called on the KMT and PFP to respect the court decision, put
an end to the year-long dispute and reconcile with the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Lee said the dispute has been clarified and social justice upheld
in the process of the trial, which involved the first recount in
Taiwan's history and the testimony by the Presidential Office, the
National Security Council and electoral, military and police
officials.</P>
      <P>He said the country has paid a heavy price because of the
irrational action taken by the KMT and PFP over the past year, which
includes circulating false accounts of the election-eve shooting to
damage the democratic image of Taiwan, mobilizing supporters to a
series of massive demonstrations and blocking a number of crucial
bills in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Election Commission released a statement
saying that it respects the ruling of the Supreme Court, which it
said has proven the impartiality of electoral workers in exercising
their duties.</P>
      <P>The CEC said it will continue to follow the principle of fairness
and objectivity in future elections and it urged the public to offer
their encouragement to all electoral workers.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Kao Yung-cheng, who is executive director of the Judicial
Reform Foundation, pointed out that the judiciary is the last
institutional resort to resolve disputes and he urged the losers to
respect the final ruling and avoid making any further unfounded
accusations to damage the credibility of the judiciary.</P>

      <P>A civic group urged China to dismantle its
military buildup targeting Taiwan and to understand that military
force cannot resolve the problems between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Chien Hsi-chieh, executive director of the PEACETIME Foundation

      <P>Quoting statistics released by the Stockholm International Peace

Japan, South Korea and Taiwan possibly launching countermeasures, and
he expressed worry that another wave of the arms race will break out

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC SITUATION TO BE BETTER IN SECOND HALF: VICE PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i said Friday that
Taiwan's economy will continue to grow and that the economic
situation will be better in the second half than in the first half of
the year.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while attending a congress of the Chinese
National Association of Industry and Commerce (CNAIC).</P>
      <P>CNAIC President Huang Mao-hsiung noted that Taiwan's economic
growth was adjusted upward to 5.71 percent from the original estimate
of 4.7 percent last year, but economic growth this year was adjusted
downward to 3.63 percent from the original estimate of 4.49 percent.</P>
      <P>The downward adjustment has to do with a slower world economy,
Huang said, but he also cited a tally by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs showing that the ratio of Taiwan manufacturers' overseas
production has continued to rise to an average of 38.23 percent,
which he said is a sign that Taiwan is losing its competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Addressing Huang's concerns, Wu said that world economic growth
has been slower this year, dropping to an estimated 3.1 percent from
last year's 3.3 percent. In the United States, it dropped to 3.4
percent from an estimated 3.6 percent, and 1.3 percent from an
estimated 1.7 percent in the European Union.</P>
      <P>The situation is the same in Taiwan, Wu said, adding however that
economic growth will continue, and "there is no need to be
pessimistic."</P>
      <P>Wu said that this year's BOT (build-operate-transfer) projects
totaled NT$100 billion (US$3.17 billion) , including underground
sewage system works. He noted that currently only 12.5 percent of
Taiwan has a sewage pipeline system, so there is a long way to go to
match the 90 percent level in some European countries and North
America.</P>
      <P>He also remarked on the minimum tax system under a tax reform
plan and a second phase of financial reforms, saying that a more
competitive financial sector will contribute to business development.</P>
      <P>Huang for his part suggested that the government ease investment
regulations, inquire about the views of businessmen while revisiting
regulations, and speed up the pace of liberalization.</P>
      <P>The ruling and the opposition parties should also seek
reconciliation to speed up the review of bills and the government
should attach importance to law and order, he said.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the government engage in trade and
economic negotiation with China, saying that if both sides of the
Taiwan Strait could sign trade and investment agreements, it would
not only bring the benefit of cross-strait economic integration, it
would also mitigate hurdles for Taiwan's bid to sign bilateral trade
agreements with other nations and avoid the fate of being
marginalized.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will issue a

      <P>Chiou said it is the responsibility of the administration to tell

country, the core values of the country's security, the state of the
national security and the priority of national security issues.</P>
      <P>The national security report, which will be the first in the

authority of the Executive Yuan by dictating any specific measures,
the president's chief security aide said.</P>
      <P>Chen huddled with his senior security aides earlier Friday to

      <P>As an advisory group to the president, Chiou said, the National

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of
Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san confirmed Thursday
that he will meet his French counterpart Friday (France time) for
talks on issues of mutual interest.</P>
      <P>Lin is in Toulouse, headquarters of Airbus, to participate in the
delivery ceremony of the fourth of eight A330-300s the China Airlines
(CAL) ordered from the airplane giant.</P>
      <P>As an advertisement by the Council of Agriculture to promote
sales of Taiwan's butterfly orchid, one of its most important
agricultural exports, the CAL's fourth A330-300 will carry a huge
image of butterfly orchid on its fuselage.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of European aviation groups, Lin also attended
the Paris Air Show held June 13-16, and traveled by France's
high-speed TGV train to compare the high-speed rail systems of Japan
and Europe.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan boasts a strong industrial foundation and is

French counterpart.</P>
      <P>Concerning the air transport charter flights between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, Lin said the government will give
precedence to negotiations on charter cargo flights, even though
China has proposed that charter passenger flights should come first.</P>
      <P>On China's offer to lift restrictions on Chinese people making
sightseeing trips to Taiwan, Lin said the issue is complicated and
needs to be decided by the proper authorities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA TO CALL COORDINATION MEETING IN PREPARATION FOR FISHERY TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
call a coordination meeting next Tuesday to forge a consensus on
Taiwan's fishery talks with Japan, due in about two weeks, a ministry
spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>The ministry has invited legislators from all the political
parties and representatives of the fishery industry to take part in
the Tuesday inter-ministerial meeting with officials from the MOFA,
the Ministry of the Interior, the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) ,
the Council of Agriculture and the National Security Bureau, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that it is better to deal with the recent fishery
disputes between Taiwan and Japan through diplomatic channels, the
spokesman said that the government hopes to create a consensus on the
issue in preparation for the coming talks with Japan -- the 15th of
their kind that will be held in late June or early July.</P>
      <P>William C. T. Lai, a caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) at the Legislative Yuan, said that the DPP
does not favor a proposal of sending military ships to escort Taiwan
fishing boats offshore.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Lai said that deploying military
escorts to the scene of the fishery disputes is not a good idea and
claimed that it would only create difficulties in bilateral
negotiations.</P>
      <P>He said that the CGA should send patrol ships to protect Taiwan
fishing boats in the disputed overlapping water claimed by both
Taiwan and Japan as part of their 200 nautical miles exclusive
economic zones before a conclusion is reached after the fishery
talks.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Lin Yu-fang said
that his demand that the Ministry of National Defense (MND) send
military vessels to escort Taiwan fishing boats is aimed at
"increasing Taiwan's bargaining chips" in negotiations with Japan.</P>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Jye decided Thursday to send
military vessels to escort Taiwan fishing boats that will operate
next Tuesday in waters some 60 nautical miles off Suao, Ilan County
-- an area near the edge of Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone.</P>
      <P>Lin told the Central News Agency that it is natural for the MND
to dispatch ships to help the CGA protect Taiwan fishermen because
the CGA has no enough number of big ships to patrol the vast area.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan San Chen also
ascribed Japan's willingness to come to the bargaining table to
Taiwan fishermen's protests. He urged the MND to throw its support
behind Taiwan's fishermen to underline the government's resolve to
seek justice for its people.</P>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers Shuai Hua-min, a
former military general, and Su Chi, a former chairman of the
Mainland Affairs Council, called a news conference at the KMT
headquarters in which they urged the government to reiterate its
traditional sovereignty over the Tiaoyutai Islands, a group of small
islets surrounded by the disputed overlapping exclusive economic
zones in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>The recent Taiwan-Japan fishery disputes are a consequence of the
sovereignty row over the Tiaoyutais and the government must do its
utmost to protect what it sees as its territory, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>KMT legislators Joanna Lei, Lai Shyh-bao and Tsao Shou-min also
voiced their support for the government's moves to claim territorial
sovereignty over the Tiaoyutais, claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>The fishing squabbles are actually sovereignty disputes, they
maintained, suggesting that President Chen Shui-bian hold a national
security meeting quickly to ensure Taiwan's fishing, mineral and
other development rights in the area.</P>
      <P>About 50 fishing vessels from Suao staged a protest last Friday
86 nautical miles off Taiwan's northeastern coast against Japanese
patrol vessels that have repeatedly dispersed or arrested Taiwan
fishing ships over the past two years in the overlapping waters after
Japan claimed sovereignty over the Tiaoyutais and expanded its
exclusive economic zone to as close as just 20 nautical miles off the
coast of Ilan.</P>
      <P>For the time being, Taiwan fishermen are requested to operate in
an area temporarily demarcated by the government to avoid direct
confrontation with Japan ahead of the two countries' fishery talks.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Bush's support on Major
Issues Tumbles in Poll.

Increasingly pessimistic about Iraq and skeptical about President
Bush's plan for Social Security, Americans are in a season of
political discontent, giving Bush one of the lowest approval ratings
of his presidency and even lower marks to Congress, according to the
New York Times/CBS News Poll. Forty-two percent of the people
responding to the poll said they approved of the way Mr. Bush was
handling his job, a marked decline from his 51 percent rating after
of the November election, when he embarked on an ambitious second
term agenda led by the overhaul of Social Security. Sixteen months
before the midterm elections, Congress fared even worse in the
survey, with the approval of just 33 percent of the respondents, and
19 percent saying Congress shared their priorities.

Wall Street Journal: Tensions Split Muslim Gr oups, Posing Big
Challenges For Interim Government.

After one of the most violent months in Iraq since the U.S.
invasion, a fundamental problem has become even more obvious in Iraq:
skyrocketing tensions between Sunni Muslims, like Mr. Hassan, and
Shiite Muslims. A recent spate of violence appears to be tit-for-tat
killings between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, two of the country's
largest groups. Even more alarming, the tension seems to reflect a
broader conflict between a Sunni-dominated insurgency and
Shiite-dominated government.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>HOSPITAL SELF-PAYMENT RATIO HIKE TO BE PUT INTO EFFECT JULY 15</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced
Friday that a self-payment ratio hike for outpatients and emergency
patients will be put into practice July 15.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said that the self-payment amount for outpatients
for district, regional and national medical center hospitals will be
raised to NT$80 (US$2.54), NT$240 and NT$360, respectively, from the
present NT$50, NT$140 and NT$210, while the self-payment amounts for
emergency patients for regional and national medical center hospitals
will be raised to NT$300 and NT$450, respectively, from the current
NT$210 and NT$420.</P>
      <P>This means that visits to national medical center hospitals will
start from NT$510, including the registration fee of NT$150 and
self-payment ratio of NT$360.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) estimated that
most people can get necessary treatment at local community clinics
and that only 20 percent of the public will be affected by the hike
plan.</P>
      <P>The BNHI said that the hike will allow the bureau to cut its
expenditure of around NT$4.3 billion a year.</P>
      <P>The burden on the underprivileged will not be increased, and the
average person will pay between 10 percent and 14 percent of the
medical bills after the hikes, health officials said, adding that it
will review the hike after six months.</P>
      <P>BNHI Vice President Chou Li-fang said the purpose of the hike is
not to increase revenues for the national health insurance plan, but
to cut expenditure.</P>
      <P>She said that around NT$4.3 billion will be saved in the first
year, or NT$1.8 billion for the remainder of this year.</P>
      <P>At present, the government reimburses around 90 percent to 91
percent of medical bills, with the public shouldering the rest.</P>
      <P>After the hike, the self-payment ratio for visits to national
medical center hospitals will increase to 13.8 percent, while the
ratio will increase to 12.9 percent in regional hospitals and 9.9
percent in district hospitals.</P>
      <P>Health officials have listed the following categories for which
self-payment will be waived: major disease such as cancer; rare
diseases; women giving birth; residents in mountainous areas and
outlying islands; low-income households; veterans; and children under
three years old.</P>
      <P>In addition, sufferers of 97 chronic diseases will be waived from
self-payment for medicines and the handicapped will only pay NT$50 in
self-payment.</P>
      <P>A double hike of health insurance premiums and self-payment ratio
was put into effect in September 2003 despite opposition from the
national health insurance supervisory committee and the public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FISHERMEN PROTEST AT MOFA, JAPANESE MISSION OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scores of Taiwan fishermen and human rights
activists protested Friday at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs over
the recent fishing disputes between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>Displaying banners blaming the government's inability to handle
the disputes and demanding that the officials in charge step down,
they also staged a skit to vent their anger over what they called a
"useless government" and "cowardly officials."</P>
      <P>Claiming that the Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea belongs
to Taiwan and saying that Taiwan fishermen must not be humiliated by
Japanese patrol vessels when operating in surrounding waters, they
chanted slogans urging government officials to protect Taiwan
fishermen and Taiwan territorial waters by loudly declaring its 200
mile exclusive economic zone.</P>
      <P>Chin Chieh-shou, a Taipei county councilor who was present to
lend his support to the fishermen, insisted that "Japan must get out
of the Tiaoyutais," because the islands, traditional territory of the
Republic of China, has been occupied by Japan, which is the root
cause of the recent fishery disputes between the two countries.</P>
      <P>A fishery rights group issued a statement demanding that
President Chen Shui-bian make clear Taiwan's claim that the
Tiaoyutais are national territory and support a demand by Taiwan's
aborigines to call their ancestors' souls back to Taiwan by demanding
Japan remove their names from memorial plaques at Japan's Yasukuni
Shrine.</P>
      <P>It also demanded that Chen fire Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan
San Chen, Coast Guard Administration Minister Syu Huei-you and Koh
Se-kai, Taiwan's representative to Japan, for their inability to
handle the disputes.</P>
      <P>Lee Chuang-tung, deputy director-general of the MOFA's Department
of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, received a petition from the
demonstrators.</P>
      <P>The protesters then proceeded to the Taipei office of the
Interchange Association, Japan's representative office in Taiwan,
where they made a strong protest by tearing down Japan's naval flag
and a photo of the Yasukuni Shrine and tossing down a basket of
rotten fish.</P>
      <P>They demanded that the Japanese government immediately release
Taiwan fishermen in its custody.</P>
      <P>Fishery disputes between the two countries have escalated in
recent years, with Taiwan fishing boats being repeatedly dispersed or
detained by Japanese patrol vessels while operating in waters near
the Tiaoyutais.</P>
      <P>A fishing ship from Suao, in eastern Taiwan's Ilan County, is
still being detained by the Japanese authorities.</P>

      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of
China will offer financial aid to help 50 students from tsunami
affected areas in Aceh, Indonesia, to finish their university
education in Taiwan, president of the organization Hau Lung-bin said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made after a visit to Aceh in March by Taipei
City advisor Lin Cheng-hsiou following the earthquakes and ensuing
tsunami in December.</P>
      <P>Lin found that many students there still have been unable to
continue their education several months after the tsunami, prompting
him to solicit the help of the Red Cross.</P>
      <P>Hau said that the recipients of the financial aid will not
necessarily be ethnic Chinese, but he added that they will be given
priority.</P>
      <P>A group of 20 students from Aceh visited Jin Wen Institute of
Technology and the ROC Red Cross earlier that day. After learning
that the ROC Red Cross will offer them NT$15,000 for monthly spending
and housing, one girl expressed her deep gratitude.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsiao-mei, a 17-year-old girl who lost her mother in the
tsunami and whose father still has not recovered from injuries he
suffered at that time, said she hopes to study biotechnology in
Taiwan after seeing for herself the progress of the country.</P>
      <P>Wu said she hopes to help her hometown in Aceh after finishing
her university education in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said he will arrange several visits for the Indonesian
students to other Taiwan universities in the next few days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it was reported that the Buddhist Compassionate Relief
Tzu Chi Foundation has established a cooperation project with an
Indonesian Buddhist foundation to help tsunami-affected people
reconstruct their hometown and assist their children to have a better
learning environment.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defeated presidential candidate Lien Chan
and his running mate James Soong have provided insufficient evidence
to back their claim that President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu set up last year's election-eve shooting of themselves,
the Supreme Court ruled Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen and Lu staging the shooting to give them an advantage in the
March 20 election was claimed by Lien and Soong as one of the reasons
that their re-election should be nullified. The case was rejected by
the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>According to the verdict, the Taiwan High Court has determined
that a wound to Chen's abdomen was caused by a gun.</P>
      <P>However, as the shooter and weapon have not been found, it
remains unknown as to how the president was shot, if one or two
shooters were involved, if one gun or two guns were used, or from
what angle and distance the shots were fired. Therefore, it is
difficult to judge if the wound suffered by Chen was caused by a
set-up shooting.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court said a stunt conducted by opposition Kuomintang
Legislator Shuai Hua-min lacked credibility because his so-called
"test" used a pig in a static state as a target, which was different
from the situation in which Chen was shot -- he was standing in a
moving jeep and the weapon used in the test was not similar to the
type used in Chen's shooting.</P>

      <P>A Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmaker lauded President Chen Shui-bian's proposed national security
report Friday as a big leap in the country's democracy.</P>
      <P>Hours after a presidential aide announced that Chen will issue
the country's first national security report later this summer, DPP
Legislator Chen Chin-jun said it is the responsibility of the
popularly elected president to give this report to the people.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lai Shyh-pao said it is only
natural for the president to report to the people on incidents
concerning national security.</P>
      <P>Instead of giving reports regularly, Lai said, the president
should present a report whenever there is an incident of national
concern.</P>
      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Mark M.H. Ho said
the president's national security report should cover only issues
about territory and sovereignty, with everything else dealt with in

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES OPPOSITION TO SIT IN EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh promised Friday to
solve the problem of flooding in Taiwan as long as the legislature
sits in an extraordinary session and approves an NT$80 billion
(US$2.55 billion) special budget for flood control.</P>
      <P>The premier's call was all the more urgent as southern Taiwan was
inundated again Friday after a week of torrential rain.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is hardly a year goes by without flooding in
Taiwan, the premier said the taxpayers' money would be better spent
on flood protection than on helping the victims of flooding every
year.</P>
      <P>The premier said the NT$80 billion to be used to dredge
flood-prone rivers, build levees and pumping stations in low-lying
areas around the island over eight years will pale in comparison to
the NT$70 billion used to tame the Keelung River in northern Taiwan
alone.</P>
      <P>By sitting for an extra eight to 10 days, the premier said, the
legislature will be able to approve the budgets for flood-prevention
projects and an arms purchase program, as well as several other bills
ungently needed by his administration.</P>
      <P>In support of the premier's call, Legislator William Lai, the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) legislative whip,
announced that his caucus will present a motion June 20 for an
extraordinary session.</P>
      <P>The motion has already been signed by all 89 DPP lawmakers, far
more than the 57 sponsors required for such a motion, Lai said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the two budgets mentioned by the premier, Lai said
his caucus will ask for action on four other bills during the extra
session.</P>
      <P>Noting that the main opposition Kuomintang is engrossed in the
election of its chairman, Lai said his caucus wanted to call for an
extra session after the KMT's July 16 election but was forced to
request it sooner because of the flooding.</P>
      <P>However, the premier's call was snubbed by the opposition People
First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Branding the premier's call a red herring, PFP legislative whip
Lee Yung-ping pointed out that the NT$80 billion budget, even if it
is approved now, will not be appropriated until next year and that it
makes no sense to ram the budget bill through the legislature in an
extraordinary session.</P>
      <P>Saying the premier is trying to build public pressure against the
opposition, Lee said the PFP will not yield to the threat.</P>
      <P>Also, the PFP whip said, the budget for flood-prevention projects
should be prepared as part of the government's general budget rather
than a special budget, which is free from a legal ceiling on the
government's capability to raise loans.</P>
      <P>Lee said the legislature has already approved NT$212
billion-worth of special budgets asked by the DPP government in the
last five years, and there are still NT$610 billion-worth of special
budgets pending in the legislature, which will become a heavy
financial burden for the next generation and will inevitably result
in a tax hike.</P>
      <P>She said the DPP government should incorporate the NT$80 million
budget into the government's regular budget and present it to the
Legislature Yuan in the next session later this year rather than
calling for an extra legislative session.</P>

      <P>United States Secretary of State

    <HEADLINE>ONLY A DEMOCRATIC CHINA CAN ENSURE CROSS-STRAIT PEACE: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18(CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A key question for the development of
cross-Taiwan Strait ties is whether China can rise peacefully and
become a democratic and rational country, a high-ranking official of
the Presidential Office said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general of the office, made the remarks
while addressing an academic seminar on "constitutional amendments
and cross-strait relations" at National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the constitutional amendments proffered by the
Legislature last August and vetted by the now defunct National
Assembly on June 7 are significant steps on the road to reform in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's future development is closely related to cross-strait
relations, he said; however, problems related to this are not the
sole arbiter of what the future will bring; rather, whether or not
China can meaningfully traverse the path down the road to democracy
and rationality in dealing with Taiwan will determine, to a large
part, whether Taiwan and China can resolve their political
differences in a peaceful and appropriate manner. Taiwan's further
democratization will surely be a catalyst for the Chinese to follow,
he added.</P>
      <P>"So far, economic development in China has not successfully
pushed the country forward toward democratization; on the contrary,
it has strengthened the leadership's control over the people, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Touching on China's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, Yu said
that this sort of non-pacifistic and aggressive behavior not only
defies the U.S. principle of resolving cross-strait problems
peacefully, but intensifies tensions in the Strait. Moreover, he
added, this could be a ticking time bomb threatening regional
stability.</P>
      <P>Talking about Beijing's recent use of nationalism to stir up
anti-Japan sentiments, the official said that although nationalism is
not negative, one-party dictatorship and the lack of democratic
supervision and freedoms of the press and speech in China result in
its people being easily manipulated and can lead to the development
of nationalism for an irrational end.</P>
      <P>He also commented on media reports that China might send troops
to Kyrgyzstan, saying that if this is true, it will be the first time
that China will have sent military forces in peacetime to a foreign
country, which represents the first step of Chinese military
expansion beyond its borders.</P>
      <P>"As I said in my speeches delivered in Washington, D.C. and New
York while meeting with think tanks last month, as China rises,
economic reforms cannot ensure that it will become a responsible
superpower, " Yu noted, adding that "I believe that the key point of
maintaining peace in East Asia is China's democratization."</P>
      <P>"Without a democratic China, there will be no peace in East Asia
and there exists now an urgent need to accelerate China's democratic
reforms," he said.</P>
      <P>Only with more democratization in Taiwan can China's democratic
development be helped, he concluded, adding that the emergence of a
democratic China will then be able to guarantee the peaceful
co-existence of the two sides of the Strait.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Provincial Farmers' Association
(TPFA) delegates will abide by the country's laws and respect the
government's authority while discussing details of fruit exports to
China with Chinese representatives next week, TPFA Chairman Liu
Chuan-chung said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, who is also an opposition Kuomintang
legislator, neither side will release any statement after the talks.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a media report that the TPFA will send
delegates to China next week to hold talks with Chinese
representatives on details of fruit exports to China and that Taiwan
fruits are expected to be granted tariff-free treatment by Beijing by
July.</P>
      <P>The report said the TPFA, instead of signing an agreement, might
release a joint statement with China's Ministry of Commerce after the
talks to bypass Taiwan laws that prohibit civic organizations from
negotiating or establishing an agreement with Chinese authorities
without the government's authorization.</P>
      <P>Liu claimed the trip is being arranged at the invitation of the
Cross-Strait Association on Trade Exchanges, a non-profit
organization set up by China's Ministry of Commerce, and that the
talks will be between two civic organizations.</P>
      <P>He said the TPFA is only trying to help Taiwan farmers sell their
fruits in China, which he called a "purely business activity."</P>
      <P>The lawmaker stressed that he is a law-abiding person and will
not do anything detrimental to national interests.</P>
      <P>However, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) does not
approve of the move.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, pointed
out that the government has decided to authorize the Taiwan External
Trade Development Council to negotiate with China under the World
Trade Organization framework on details concerning the sale of Taiwan
agricultural products to China.</P>
      <P>But China is trying to deal with the issue as some kind of
domestic transaction and to downgrade the status of Taiwan to become
a local government under China by opting to hold talks with the TPFA,
Lai said, urging the TPFA not to fall into the trap set by Beijing.</P>

      <P>The recent flooding in southern Taiwan has

downpour in June 1998, in which agricultural damage reached NT$1.91
billion.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's son, Chih-chung,
married his fiancee, Huang Jui-ching, in Taipei Saturday.</P>
      <P>The wedding was held in the morning according to Taiwanese
tradition, followed by a banquet at noon at the Sheraton Taipei Hotel
where around 500 guests including a number of top government
officials and business leaders joined the first family in celebrating
the marriage.</P>
      <P>Addressing the banquet, President Chen said his son is forming
his own family at such a young age probably because there is a
tradition of early marriage in his family and he told Chih-chung to
be responsible for everything he does from now on as getting married
means " becoming a grown-up."</P>
      <P>The president said the heavy rains that triggered severe flooding
in southern Taiwan in the week leading up to the wedding served as a
good reminder for the new couple that there are still a lot of
unfortunate people who need care and help.</P>
      <P>Lastly, the president advised his son not to follow in his
footsteps and enter politics, saying his wife, Wu Shu-jen, is bound
to a wheelchair for the rest of her life because of his choice.</P>
      <P>Chih-chung, 26, obtained a master's degree in law from the
University of California at Berkeley in May. The bride is a pianist
who holds a master's degree in piano performance from the Taipei
National University of the Arts. The couple will travel to the United
States to continue their studies after their marriage.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office previously announced that the couple will
donate NT$2 million (NT$63,897) in cash to three charitable
organizations in the southern city of Tainan to mark their wedding.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei City Police Department, approximately 300
police officers were assigned to maintain order in areas surrounding
the president's official residence and Sheraton Taipei Hotel, because
several civic groups were planning to take the opportunity of the
wedding to stage a demonstration or try to present a petition to the
president.</P>

      <P>A total of 174 teams and individual street

city bureau of cultural affairs said Saturday.</P>
      <P>At the end of June, the recognized street artists will be granted

      <P>The groups and individuals, include 87 in the field of performing

selected from 333 hopefuls in the official review, which was
conducted in May at the National Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Center.</P>
      <P>The review was not only centered on creativity, but also demanded
that participants be able to engage in interactions with the
audience, officials of the bureau said, noting that most musical
performers failed to pass the review because of their reluctance to
interact with the public.</P>
      <P>The test and review was part of the city government's efforts to
raise the artistic level of street performing activities, according

foundation and to grow step by step.</P>
      <P>On the "three-in-one" -- or city and county head, city and county

      <P>Regarding a report of representatives of a
provincial farmers' association to visit China next week for talks on
Taiwan fruit exports to China, the Council of Agriculture (COA) on
Saturday unveiled its position in dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>The position is made of "one principle, three arrangements, " COA
officials explained, stating that the principle is that the council
takes all-out efforts to promote agricultural exports, and the sales
to China are only a part of the COA's global marketing strategies.</P>
      <P>Under the principle, the COA initiated three arrangements for the
export drive, which include designating the semi-official Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) to take charge of the
sale of Taiwan agricultural products to worldwide markets including
China, while allowing local farmers' associations only to serve as
suppliers.</P>
      <P>The other two arrangements are namely forming a professional team
along with the Mainland Affairs Council to conduct negotiations with
relevant Chinese authorities on authority problems concerning the
exports to China, such as tariffs, quarantines, quality inspections
and customs clearance, while asking TAITRA to assist in the
arrangement of relevant talks; and promoting the opening of
cross-strait talks on "non-stop" cargo charter flights, which will
ensure the freshness of high-priced fruits or other fresh
agricultural products that Taiwan exports to China during shipment,
according to the COA.</P>
      <P>The COA underlined that members of farmers' associations around
the country should respect existing laws while dealing with issues on
cross-strait agricultural exchanges, referring to the reported plan
of the Taiwan Provincial Farmers' Association to hold talks with
Chinese representatives on details of fruit exports to China.</P>

      <P>Ho noted that Taiwan, with its exports amounting to US$174
billion in 2004, is the world's 15th-largest trading country.</P>
      <P>While 70 percent of the exports by Taiwan are raw materials and
parts and components, 25 percent are machinery, and only 5 percent

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A gentleman esteems what is right
as of the highest importance. A gentleman who has valor, but is
without a knowledge and love of what is right, is likely to commit a
crime. A common man who has courage, but is without the knowledge and
love of what is right, is likely to become a robber."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ROC NAVY FLOTILLA COMPLETES ROUND-THE-WORLD VOYAGE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China Navy flotilla, which
embarked in March on its first round-the-world voyage in a display of
long-range sea power, returned to Taiwan Sunday, Navy sources
reported.</P>
      <P>Navy Commander-in-Chief Chen Pang-chih officiated at a ceremony
held at the Tsuoying naval base in southern Taiwan to mark the
success of the flotilla's mission and of the commencement of
round-the-world navigation training.</P>
      <P>The flotilla -- comprised of the French-built Lafayette-class
frigate "Kang Ding," the U.S.-built Perry-class frigate "Wu Yi" and a
logistical support vessel, with a 700-strong crew -- returned early
Sunday morning to the Tsuoying base after having sailed over 55,500
kilometers in 105 days around the globe.</P>
      <P>The naval vessels made port calls in seven countries which
maintain formal diplomatic relations with the ROC and made refueling
stops in several countries in the Indian Ocean that recognize China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FARMERS' ASSOCIATION'S REPORTED UPCOMING TALKS WITH CHINA CAUSE STORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local farmers' group was at the center of
a political storm Sunday after a local newspaper reported that the
group will visit China next week to negotiate with Chinese
authorities over Taiwan fruit exports to the country.</P>
      <P>Legislator William Lai, the whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) at the Legislative Yuan, urged the government
to prosecute the leaders of the Farmers' Association of Taiwan
Province to the full extent of law if they dare to enter into a pact
with China on Taiwan fruit exports to the country.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Executive Yuan has authorized the Taiwan External
Trade Development Council to talk with Chinese authorities on Taiwan
fruit exports, Lai said the association should abide by the
government's decision and "not play into Beijing's hands" by dealing
on its own with China.</P>
      <P>Lai dismissed China's policy of allowing the import of 15 kinds
of Taiwan fruits duty-free as "an attempt to alienate fruit farmers
from the government, " blaming the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) for
cajoling the farmers' association into contacting China.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the KMT, whose chairman Lien Chan won the import
concessions when he met with Chinese President Hu Jintao during his
Chinese tour in April, is pulling strings behind the scenes, adding
that the president of the farmers' association, Liu Chuan-chung, is a
KMT lawmaker.</P>
      <P>By accepting Beijing's invitation to engage in talks, Lai
claimed, the farmers' association is allowing Beijing to manipulate
Taiwan, which he said is dangerous for the island.</P>
      <P>Mark M. H. He, the Taiwan Solidarity Union's legislative
convener, agreed with the DPP lawmaker's view, saying that Beijing's
concessions on Taiwanese fruit imports is "more of a political charm
offense than an economic policy."</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that Taiwan is an independent state, Ho
said, negotiations on exports of Taiwan agricultural products to
China should be held bilaterally under the framework of the World
Trade Organization, adding that the farmers' association's contact
with Chinese authorities will help Beijing's ploy of sidestepping
Taiwan government authorities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT lawmaker Tseng Yung-chuan said that as a private
group aimed at promoting farmers' interests, the farmers'
association's efforts to explore overseas markets for local farmers
should be encouraged rather than be dissuaded.</P>
      <P>Tseng, who is the director of KMT Policy Coordination Committee,
said the DPP government should give free rein to the farmers'
association within the law to explore overseas markets for the
benefit of local farmers.</P>
      <P>An official from the farmers' association said his group won't
encroach on the power of the government during its pending talks with
China, adding that the government really has little role in the deal
and can hardly prevent Taiwan fruits from entering the mainland
market as long as China allows the imports.</P>
      <P>The official, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that Taiwan
exported 13,500 tons of fruit to the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau in
2004, accounting for 6 percent of Taiwan's total fruit exports, even
without the government's official permission.</P>
      <P>If the Council of Agriculture forbids fruit exports to the
mainland, the official pointed out, traders can simply sell their
product to Hong Kong before re-exporting it to the mainland, a move
which he said is beyond the government's control.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR CALM OVER FISHERY DISPUTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh appealed Sunday for
calm over fishery disputes between Taiwan and Japan in their
overlapping fishing grounds, saying that these disputes can be
resolved via legal professionals, fishermen's associations or private
organizations in a peaceful and rational manner.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the call after a spate of incidents in which Taiwanese
fishing boats were chased and impounded by Japanese patrol boats,
with some Taiwan fishermen even being prosecuted in Japanese courts.
In the latest incident, the skipper of the Pingtung-registered
fishing boat "Chinmingtsai No. 11" was detained by the Japanese coast
guard early Saturday morning for "illegally fishing in Japanese
waters off Miyako Island, Okinawa," according to Japanese police.</P>
      <P>Hsieh reiterated the government's resolve to protect the rights
and interests of Taiwan fishermen, saying that the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs has been handling the latest dispute via diplomatic
channels.</P>
      <P>The premier appealed to the fishermen and their families to trust
the administration's determination in protecting them, but he added
that there are certain limits for Taiwan's law enforcement forces in
exercising their authority in the disputed areas.</P>
      <P>A police officer from the Okinawa Prefecture told CNA that the
Taiwanese fishing boat "Chinmingtsai No. 11" was spotted by a
Japanese patrol vessel Friday night in waters 65 kilometers off the
east coast of Miyako Island, which is within Japan's exclusive
economic zone.</P>
      <P>The "Chinmingtsai No. 11" with skipper, identified as Chen
Teh-liang, and four crew members, had refused to stop for inspection
and was finally apprehended by the Japanese patrol vessel two hours
later, the Okinawa police said.</P>
      <P>Chen Teh-liang, admitted that he was fishing illegally, according
to Japanese police.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said
Saturday that the fishing boat was operating in waters 35 nautical
miles off the east coast of Miyako Island, which is beyond Taiwan's
exclusive economic zone of 200-nautical miles, and was therefore
detained by Japanese police.</P>
      <P>However, he said that officials of the ROC representative office
stationed in Okinawa have contacted Japanese authorities in the hopes
that the skipper can be released on bail as early as possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CLOSELY WATCHING JAPANESE COUNCILORS' PLANNED TIAOYUTAIS VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
closely watching developments regarding the planned inspection tour
of the Tiaoyutai Islands by councilors from Ishigaki Island in
Japan's Okinawa Prefecture, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The latest news reports from Japan have it that Ishigaki's city
council recently passed a resolution stipulating that the Tiaoyutai
Islands -- known in Japan as the Senkaku Islands, over which Taiwan,
Japan and China each claim sovereignty -- are part of the
administrative zone under Ishigaki City, and allowing Ishigaki city
councilors to go ashore the disputed islands for inspections.</P>
      <P>Commenting on these reports, Lu said that Japan is a democracy
and that elected representatives there are free to choose their own
ways to express their opinions.</P>
      <P>While closely monitoring developments, Lu said, Taiwan's foreign
ministry has repeated calls that the two countries hold talks to sort
out their fishery disputes arising from overlapping economic zones,
such as the area in the East China Sea and south of Okinawa, as well
as the issue of sovereignty over the Tiaoyutai Islands.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Frank Hsieh on Sunday likened the Japanese
city councilors' plan to visit the Tiaoyutais to Taiwan legislators'
recent push to inspect the Tiaoyutais by frigate, saying that all
these "private deeds do not necessarily reflect the ideas or
resolutions of the governments."</P>
      <P>Lu also noted that skipper Chen Teh-liang of the
Pingtung-registered fishing boat "Chinmingtsai No. 11, " who was
detained by the Japanese coast guard early Saturday morning for
"illegally fishing in Japanese waters off Miyako Island, Okinawa, "
is expected to be released along with his vessel Monday or Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lu added that the owners of the "Chinmingtsai No. 11" agreed
Sunday to pay for Chen and the fishing vessel's release.</P>
      <P>A police officer from the Okinawa Prefecture told CNA that the
"Chinmingtsai No. 11" was spotted by a Japanese patrol vessel Friday
night in waters 65 kilometers off the east coast of Miyako Island,
which is within Japan's exclusive economic zone.</P>
      <P>The "Chinmingtsai No. 11" with its skipper and four crew members
aboard, had refused to stop for inspection and was finally
apprehended by the Japanese patrol vessel two hours later, the
Okinawa police said.</P>
      <P>Chen Teh-liang, admitted that he was fishing illegally, according
to Japanese police.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Lu also said Saturday that the fishing boat was
operating in waters 35 nautical miles off the east coast of Miyako
Island, which is beyond Taiwan's exclusive economic zone of
200-nautical miles, and was therefore detained by Japanese police.</P>
      <P>Lu added that officials of the ROC representative office
stationed in Okinawa have contacted Japanese authorities in the hopes
that the skipper can be released on bail as early as possible.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan are expected to hold a 15th round of fishery
talks in Tokyo in late June or early July to address the disputes
through bilateral negotiations in a peaceful and rational manner.</P>
      <P>Nearly 50 fishing boats from Suao, in the eastern Taiwan county
of Ilan, protested June 10 in waters 86 nautical miles off Taiwan's
northeastern coast against Japanese patrol vessels that had expelled
Taiwan fishing ships from an area in which the 200-nautical mile
exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan overlap.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fishing ships have been repeatedly expelled or detained by
Japanese patrol vessels over the past two years after Japan
readjusted and expanded its exclusive economic zone to as close as
some 20 nautical miles off the coasts of Ilan and neighboring Hualien
counties.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has filed a strong protest against Japan over
the controversy via Taiwan's liaison office in Tokyo and has asked
that Taiwan and Japan seek to resolve their fishing disputes through
dialogue in line with international law.</P>
      <P>Ahead of the 15th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks, Taiwanese
fishermen have been asked by the Coast Guard Administration to
operate within the area temporarily demarcated by the government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Suao Fishermen's Association reported recently
that a total of 13 Suao fishing boats have been seized by Japan since
2001 while operating in Taiwan's economic zone, and the boat owners
or families of the fishermen have had to pay for their release.</P>
      <P>An association official said that overlapping economic zones and
fishing rights being encroached upon are long-standing problems, and
if the government is unable to solve them, the fishermen could stage
an even bigger protest next time.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent aboriginal lawmaker Kao Chin
Su-mei urged the government Sunday to more aggressively defend the
interests of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin made the comments at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport upon her return from a visit to Japan at the head of a group
of Taiwan aborigines, saying that she had originally thought the
current government to be more courageous than previous ones but was
later disappointed to find that it has failed to properly protect the
interests of the people.</P>
      <P>Recalling that the government had vowed, in the lead-up to the
March 26 demonstration against China, to make Taiwan's voice resonate
around the world, Kao Chin said she regrets the fact that the
government turned a deaf ear to aborigines' call for help in their
dispute with Japan authorities.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin and her group appealed three days ago for the
government's intervention in Tokyo when they were prohibited by
Japanese police from leaving their bus to stage a protest at the
Yasukuni Shrine to call for the removal of memorial tablets for
Taiwan aboriginal soldiers who died fighting for the Japanese
Imperial Army during World War II when Taiwan was still a colony of
Japan.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin and her followers claimed that these Taiwan aboriginal
soldiers were forced to serve in the Japanese Imperial Army and would
not want to be worshiped in a shrine set up to honor the deceased
soldiers of a country that had invaded Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh didn't respond to Kao Chin's call at that
time, saying that he respects the Japanese police's handling of the
Taiwan protesters.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin said her regret has "almost turned to anger" amid
reports that Taiwan fishermen have been chased out of one of their
traditional fishing grounds to the northeast of Taiwan by Japanese
patrol boats in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>She urged the government to deliver on its promise to protect the
people of Taiwan and to look after their rights and interests "with
deeds, and not empty words."</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu, who greeted Kao
Chin and her group at the airport, said his ministry will continue
negotiating with Tokyo authorities on ways to address the requests of
Kao Chin and her group.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO CALL FOR EXTRAORDINARY LEGISLATIVE SESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will on Monday propose holding an extraordinary session of the
Legislative Yuan to screen various key bills, DPP caucus whip William
C. T. Lai said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lai said that the DPP caucus will present the proposal to the
Legislative Yuan to call for a special session to deal with six bills
of major concern, including a major arms procurement bill and a bill
regarding flood control and prevention which has become more urgent
following recent flooding in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The proposal was signed by 89 DPP lawmakers, more than the
minimum level of one-quarter of the 225 legislators required by the
Constitution to call a special legislative session, Lai said, urging
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) to
support the proposal.</P>
      <P>According to Chao Yung-ching, another DPP caucus whip, no exact
date for the extraordinary session is mentioned in the proposal. He
said a date can be decided through inter-party negotiations to be
presided over by Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the main opposition KMT said that it refuses to hold
an extra legislative session for the sake of the DPP's call to deal
with the recent flood damage in central and southern counties.</P>
      <P>KMT Central Policy Committee head Tseng Yung-chuan argued that
the Executive Yuan still has NT$19.3 billion in a special fund for
emergency use that can be put toward flood relief efforts. He said
that sending out aid to flood victims is an emergency response and is
not related to implementing flood control projects, funding for which
he said should be included in the government's regular annual budget.</P>
      <P>There is no urgent need to convene an extraordinary session of
the Legislative Yuan, he said, adding that it is inappropriate to
hold extra legislative sessions too frequently.</P>
      <P>The KMT only called two extra legislative sessions in more than
50 years when it was the ruling party, but the DPP has held five such
sessions since it came to power in 2000, he noted.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Chen Chih-ping voiced the same
opinion, saying that it is unnecessary to convene a special
legislative session at the present time as the Executive Yuan still
has adequate funds for natural disaster relief.</P>
      <P>Flood control projects require lengthy and in-depth study and
planning by the government, and the Cabinet should submit such
projects in its annual budget for screening by the legislature, he
insisted.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, a legislative whip of the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) , said that his party is in favor of calling a special
legislative session to scrutinize significant bills regarding a major
military procurement plan and to approve the nomination list of
Control Yuan members submitted by the president.</P>
      <P>The TSU supports the idea of holding an extraordinary session,
but flooding is not the main issue waiting to be handled, Ho pointed
out, saying that the government should put forward its flood control
projects and budgets for legislative approval in phases, instead of
using the issue as a way to pass the buck to others.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh has several times called for a special
legislative session to screen an eight-year flood control project
worth NT$80 billion that he proposed soon after assuming the
premiership in February this year.</P>
      <P>Legislative speaker Wang said that the Legislative Yuan will
certainly approve well-crafted flood control projects put forward by
the Executive Yuan to improve the livelihood of the people.</P>
      <P>But Wang was reserved about the NT$80 billion special budget plan
raised by Hsieh for what he called a flood control project, making it
clear that such a program must be comprehensively designed in advance
and pointing out that the government currently has enough funds to
aid the flood victims.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, tallies compiled by the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture showed that as of 11: 00 a. m. Sunday, damage to the
agricultural sector caused by flooding since last Sunday totaled a
record high NT$2.14 billion (US$68 million) . Chiayi, Kaohsiung,
Pingtung, Tainan and Yunlin have been the hardest hit counties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENIOR OFFICER CALLS FOR COUNTRY'S SUPPORT FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of a Republic of China Navy
flotilla which returned from a three-month round-the-world voyage
Sunday called for the country to throw its support behind the Navy as
well as the development of national defense.</P>
      <P>Rear Adm. Fan Pao-hua, who led the flotilla on its 105-day global
navigation training mission, said that the voyage was smooth and
successful, with morale among the crew being very high, thanks to the
support rendered by the nation and the crew's families.</P>
      <P>The Navy's first round-the-world mission not only took members of
the ROC Navy to every corner of the Earth, it also wrote a new page
in ROC history in sea power and diplomacy, Fan said during a press
conference held at the Tsuoying naval base in southern Taiwan to mark
the success of the flotilla's mission.</P>
      <P>Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm.Chen Pang-chih officiated at a
ceremony earlier in the day to mark the successful commencement of
the Navy's round-the-world navigation training.</P>
      <P>According to Fan, the flotilla -- comprised of the French-built
Lafayette-class frigate "Kang Ding, " the U.S.-built Perry-class
frigate "Wu Yi" and a logistical support vessel, with a 700-strong
crew -- departed Tsuoying March 7 and returned to the same naval base
early Sunday morning after having sailed over 26,000 nautical miles
around the globe.</P>
      <P>Fan reported that the naval vessels cruised three major oceans
and four major seas around the globe and made port calls in seven
countries which maintain formal diplomatic relations with the ROC,
including Panama, Senegal, Kiribatis, Gambia and Palau, adding that
the ships also sailed across five channels, capes and canals during
the navigation mission.</P>
      <P>The flotilla's voyage, dubbed Taiwan's "warship diplomacy, " set
a ROC Navy record in terms of distance traveled, during which the
Navy officers and cadets spread the word in ROC allies countries
about Taiwan's freedom, democracy and diverse society, Fan noted.</P>
      <P>The Navy has also examined its long-range combat capabilities in
several areas, including night-fighting, electronics warfare and
logistical operations on the seas, during the mission, according to
Fan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PROCUREMENT URGENT DUE TO CHINA'S MILITARY THREAT: VICE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Minister of National Defense Tsai
Ming-shian warned over the weekend of China's increased military
threat against Taiwan, urging the Legislative Yuan to approve a major
arms deal as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Tsai issued the warning Friday while giving a keynote speech on
national defense at a roundtable forum held by the Institute of
International Relations under National Chengchi University in
Taichung City in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that China is engaged in a two-pronged strategy in
its dealings with Taiwan, Tsai said that China has never eased its
saber rattling aimed at Taiwan despite the fact that it invited main
Taiwan opposition leaders -- Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong -- to visit in late
April and early May in a bid to improve bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>China has continued with its regular military exercises and has
plans of conducting large-scale drills aimed at Taiwan this summer, a
situation which Tsai said clearly underscores the urgent need for
Taiwan to acquire necessary defensive weapons from the United States.</P>
      <P>According to the vice minister of national defense, the military
balance across the Taiwan Strait will gradually tilt in China's favor
within three to five years, and it is estimated that China will be
capable of invading Taiwan after 2012 if it keeps expanding its
military at the current pace.</P>
      <P>For the sake of the nation's interests and security, the public
and the lawmakers should put aside their ideological differences and
partisan interests to push for a quick passage of the major arms
purchase plan and its budget bill at the Legislative Yuan, he urged.</P>
      <P>The major military procurement plan put forward by the Executive
Yuan has been stalled in the Legislative Yuan during the past two
sessions due to boycotts by the KMT and the PFP.</P>
      <P>The plan was originally estimated to cost Taiwan NT$610.8 billion
over a 15-year period, but the price has been cut to some NT$480
billion (US$15.2 billion).</P>
      <P>Items proposed by the Ministry of National Defense on the
procurement list include eight diesel-fueled submarines, six Patriot
PAC-III anti-missile batteries and 12 P-3C anti-submarine airplanes.</P>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Jye has given assurances at the
Legislative Yuan that the weapons will help Taiwan counter China's
military threat for the next 30 years.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who
doubles as a vice chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ,
said Sunday he is afraid that the nearly 110-year-old KMT may perish
if it cannot win back the presidency in 2008.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while attending a seminar with a group of
KMT die-hards who used to be military service members as part of his
campaign activities for the KMT chairmanship.</P>
      <P>In his view, Wang said, the most important mission for the next
KMT chairman is to integrate the opposition forces and work out a
ticket that can win the 2008 presidential-vice presidential election.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT, which ruled Taiwan for more than 50 years
until 2000, has lost two presidential elections in a row, Wang said
the next KMT chairman must be able to reinvigorate the party and lead
it to reclaim the presidency in 2008.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wang said he doesn't think that the next KMT
chairman himself should necessarily be the party's candidate for the
2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wang, a seasoned Taiwan-born politician, said he believes that he
himself is the one who can lead the KMT to weather all the challenges
ahead and win the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>The July 16 KMT chairmanship election pits Wang against Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is also a KMT vice chairman.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo, June 19 (CNA)
(By Amy Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japanese coast guard authorities have agreed
to release a detained Taiwan fishing boat and its crew aboard, the
Republic of China's representative stationed in Okinawa said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The "Chinmingtsai No. 11" trawler from the southern Taiwan county
of Pingtung and its four crew members were released at 9 p.m. Sunday,
Chen Chih-hung, the ROC's representative in Okinawa said.</P>
      <P>The Chinmingtsai and its crew were detained by Japanese coast
guard authorities Saturday on charges of poaching in Japan's 200-mile
exclusive economic zone some 65 nautical miles east of the Miyako
Island, Okinawa.</P>
      <P>Chen said Japanese coast guard authorities agreed to allow the
detained Taiwan fishing boat and its crew members to leave for home
after his office agreed to serve as their guarantor.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Chinmingtsai's skipper had confessed to
having traversed into Japan's exclusive economic waters. The skipper
had informed the shipowner of the situation, Chen said. Under the
Japanese maritime law, the shipowner will have to pay fine of about 2
million Japanese yen.</P>
      <P>The incident came just a few days after some 50 Taiwan fishing
boats converged in waters near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, which
were claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China, to protest Japanese patrol
ships' frequent chasing them away from their traditional fishing
grounds. The unusual move was also aimed at pushing the ROC
government to adopt more active measures to protect local fishermen's
fishing rights in the two countries' overlapping economic zones.</P>
      <P>After the unusual protest. Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration
has promised to step up patrols and cooperate with the Ministry of
National Defense in better protecting local fishermen's safety and

    <HEADLINE>CABINET URGES LEGISLATURE TO PASS FLOOD CONTROL BILL ASAP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Sunday
the government looks forward to seeing the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan hold an extra session and pass a special budget bill
for flood prevention projects as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Cho made the remarks after Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
said he would call a cross-party consultative meeting if the
legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
comes up with a proposal to hold an extra legislative session.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus is scheduled to put forward such a
proposal Monday. Previous reports said the DPP caucus is hopeful that
an extra legislative session can be held after the opposition
Kuomintang's July 16 chairmanship election.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is competing with Taipei Mayor Ma Ying for the KMT
chairmanship, said he would not neglect his duty as the legislative
speaker simply because of his personal bid for the top KMT post.</P>
      <P>"So long as the DPP caucus comes up with the proposal, I would
certainly call a meeting of legislative whips of various parties to
discuss the proposal. With the consent of various party caucuses, an
extra legislative session can be held either before or after the KMT
chairmanship election. I would faithfully fulfill my duty as
legislative speaker," Wang said.</P>
      <P>In response, Cho said the Cabinet welcomes Wang's statement. "We
hope an extra legislative session can be held soon to screen several
urgent bills, including an eight-year, NT$80 billion special budget
bill on flood control and prevention around the nation," he added.</P>
      <P>Cho stressed that the flood prevention bill, if passed, will be
implemented from 2006 with an aim to complete all flood control and
prevention projects in eight years.</P>
      <P>"The bill is a long-term project and has nothing to do with aid
to victims of the recent flooding in several central and southern
counties," Cho explained.</P>
      <P>Since the government passed a NT$30 billion budget bill in 2001
for cleaning up the Keelung River, Cho said, metropolitan Taipei has
not been hit by flash floods.</P>
      <P>"We hope Taipei City can share its experience in fighting floods
with other cities and counties," Cho said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven opposition "pan-blue alliance"
lawmakers will travel to China Monday to see for themselves customs
clearance and implementation of China's open-door policy for Taiwan's
fruit exports, legislative sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers, including Legislator Wu Chen-tian from Kinmen and
Legislator Tsao Erh-chung from Matsu, will travel to Xiamen in the
southeastern Chinese province of Fujian from Taiwan-held frontline
island of Kinmen via a direct voyage.</P>
      <P>Tsao said their visit is mainly aimed at collecting first-hand
information to serve as reference for promoting exports of Taiwan
fruits to China via the "mini three links" routes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has opened Kinmen and Matsu for direct shipping links with
two Chinese port cities -- Xiamen and Mawei -- in Fujian, known
locally as the "mini three links" routes.</P>
      <P>Since China has agreed to offer Taiwan fruits tariff-free and
speedy customs clearance privileges, Tsao said, the Kinmen and Matsu
county governments and elected representatives have hoped that Taiwan
fruits can be shipped to China via the Kinmen-Xiamen and Matsu-Mawei
"mini three links" routes.</P>
      <P>Under current Taiwan's rules, Tsao said, Taiwan-funded companies
in the Fujian area can legally ship goods, including fruits, from
Taiwan to China via Kinmen and Matsu through "mini three links"
routes.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, we want to visit Fujian to look into its
customs clearance operations and its market-opening measures for
Taiwan fruits. We hope our fact-finding visit can contribute to
future Taiwan fruit exports to China via Kinmen and Matsu through the
'mini three links' routes," Tsao added.</P>
      <P>The seven-member group will travel to Xiamen via Kinmen Monday
and return to Matsu from Mawei Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL ENERGY CONFAB SERIOUS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday that the
administration is getting down to the serious business of working out
energy policy and implementation strategy that will not compromise
the environment while being acceptable to the industrial and business
sectors.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the National Energy Conference held at
the Taipei International Convention Center, Hsieh assured the country
that this two-day meeting would not be just a ceremonial event, but
rather a serious brainstorming session aimed at working out good
energy and industrial policies.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that economic development sometimes conflicts with
environmental protection and conservation efforts. Nevertheless, the
premier said, if he had to make a choice between economic development
and environmental protection, he would opt for environmental
sustainability for the entire country.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Hsieh added that as premier, he has no right to
ignore efforts to maintain Taiwan's international competitiveness,
saying that this is the reason why he has proposed a "golden
triangle" formula to enable the country's economic growth, social
justice and environmental sustainability to progress in sync.</P>
      <P>The premier also admitted that "talking is easier than doing, "
pointing out that related issues, such as whether the fifth and the
sixth naphtha cracking plants should be built, are extremelly
challenging.</P>
      <P>Noting that greenhouse gas emissions have become an important
international issue since Feb. 16 when the Kyoto Protocol went into
effect, Hsieh encouraged participants in the National Energy
Conference to fully express their opinions and share their expertise
on the issue to assist the administration in crafting workable and
pragmatic energy policies.</P>
      <P>Hsieh added that related policies on reducing greenhouse gas
emissions are already in the administrative pipeline, adding that it
has been decided that solar energy will be used at venues of the 2009
World Games to be held in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan.</P>

Falling fares fuel short getaways.

Air fares to nearby cities have come down
sharply in the last 18 months, prompting
Singaporean travellers to make more short
getaways.

Ticket prices for some destinations within a
five-hour flying radius have fallen by as much
as 80 percent, thanks to the arrival of low-cost
carriers and fierce competition with
full-service airlines.

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER WON'T SAIL TO DISPUTED WATERS: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Executive Yuan spokesman on Monday ruled
out the possibility of Premier Frank Hsieh sailing aboard a Navy
frigate to Taiwan's exclusive economic zone off northeastern Taiwan
to inspect the government's efforts in protecting the rights and
interests of fishermen operating in the area.</P>
      <P>Discounting media reports that Premier Hsieh would probably board
a Knox-class frigate Tuesday to inspect the situation in disputed
Republic of China economic waters that overlap with those of Japan,
Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said the premier has never had such an
idea and there has been no talk on the matter.</P>
      <P>Although Hsieh will not board the frigate, which is scheduled to
sail to waters near a disputed part of the East China Sea Tuesday to
allow lawmakers to view first hand how the administration is
protecting Taiwan fishermen operating there, the resolve of the
premier and the government to protect the rights and interests of the
country's fishermen is unwavering, Cho noted.</P>
      <P>The spokesman stressed that it is not necessary to have the
premier sail to the disputed area in order to demonstrate the
administration's determination in protecting the fishermen.</P>
      <P>He added that the premier sailing to the disputed waters would
blur the focus of the government's efforts in protecting fishermen in
the disputed waters and would raise tensions, which he said the
premier wishes to avoid.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense decided last week to send a
frigate Tuesday to waters near the overlapping economic zones between
Taiwan and Japan under pressure from opposition People First Party
Legislator Lin Yu-fang after a spate of fishing disputes triggered by
Japanese patrol boats' expulsion and arrest of several Taiwanese
fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Nearly 50 fishing boats from Suao, in the eastern Taiwan county
of Ilan, protested June 10 in waters 86 nautical miles off Taiwan's
northeastern coast against Japanese patrol vessels that had expelled
Taiwan fishing ships from an area in which the 200-nautical mile
exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan overlap.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fishing ships have repeatedly been expelled or detained by
Japanese patrol vessels over the past two years after Japan
readjusted and expanded its exclusive economic zone to as close as
some 20 nautical miles off the coasts of Ilan and neighboring Hualien
counties.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has filed a strong protest against Japan over
the controversy via Taiwan's liaison office in Tokyo and has asked
that Taiwan and Japan seek to resolve their fishing disputes through
dialogue in line with international law.</P>
      <P>Ahead of the 15th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks, Taiwanese
fishermen have been asked by the Coast Guard Administration to
operate within the area temporarily demarcated by the government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Suao Fishermen's Association reported recently
that a total of 13 Suao fishing boats have been seized by Japan since
2001 while operating in Taiwan's economic zone, and the boat owners
or families of the fishermen have had to pay for their release.</P>
      <P>An association official said that overlapping economic zones and
fishing rights being encroached upon are long-standing problems, and
if the government is unable to solve them, the fishermen could stage
an even bigger protest next time.</P>

    <DATELINE>Pingtung,  southern  Taiwan,  June  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The family of the
skipper of the Pingtung-based "Chinmingtsai No. 11" trawler, which
was detained by Japanese coast guard authorities two days ago for
poaching in Japan's exclusive economic zone, are now fretting over
how to pay the heavy Japanese fine.</P>
      <P>The wife of skipper Chen Teh-liang appealed to the central
government for financial assistance to help them raise the 2.36
million Japanese yen (NT$679,276) in two weeks to pay for Chen and
the trawler's release.</P>
      <P>The "Chinmingtsai No. 11" and its four-member crew were detained
by Japanese coast guard authorities Saturday on charges of poaching
in Japan's 200-mile exclusive economic zone some 65 nautical miles
east of Miyako Island, Okinawa.</P>
      <P>The Japanese coast guard authorities released the detained Taiwan
fishing boat and its crew around 9 p.m. Sunday after the Republic of
China's representative stationed in Okinawa, Chen Chih-hung, promised
to serve as their guarantor, promising that the skipper will pay the
2.36 million yen fine in two weeks.</P>
      <P>According Rep. Chen, the "Chinmingtsai's" skipper had confessed
to having transgressed into Japan's exclusive economic waters, and
under Japanese maritime law, the shipowner must pay a fine of about
two million Japanese yen for the ship and crew's release.</P>
      <P>Skipper Chen is expected to sail back to Pingtung aboard the
"Chinmingtsai" Tuesday or Wednesday, according to authorities from
the Pingtung Fishermen's Association.</P>
      <P>The incident came just a few days after some 50 Taiwan fishing
boats converged in waters near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, known
in Japan as the Senkaku Islands, which are claimed by Taiwan, Japan
and China, to protest Japanese patrol ships' frequently chasing them
away from their traditional fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>The unusual move was also aimed at pushing the ROC government to
adopt more active measures to protect local fishermen's rights in the
two countries' overlapping economic zones.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fishing ships have repeatedly been expelled or detained by
Japanese patrol vessels over the past two years after Japan
readjusted and expanded its exclusive economic zone to as close as
some 20 nautical miles off the coasts of Ilan and neighboring Hualien

    <HEADLINE>SHOW OF FORCE  CANNOT RESOLVE FISHING RIGHTS DISPUTES: DPP LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A show of force cannot resolve
international fishing rights disputes, a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker said Monday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Cho-shui made the remarks a day before an ROC
naval ship will sail to a disputed part of the East China Sea where
the 200-mile exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan overlap to
accentuate the Republic of China government's determination to
protect the nation's fishing and other economic rights in the region.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lin said that flexing military muscle is by
no means an appropriate way to resolve these sorts of issues.</P>
      <P>"International fishing rights disputes must be settled through
negotiations and a show of force cannot resolve the matter, " Lin
said at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chang Ping-tang, a Ministry of
National Defense (MND) official, said fishing disputes were better
handled by the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) with the MND offering
only behind-the-scenes support and assistance.</P>
      <P>"As warships coming to the 'first' line could escalate tensions,
we should exercise self-restraint, " said Chang, whose official title
is assistant deputy chief of the Office of the Deputy Chief of the
General Staff for Operations.</P>
      <P>The MND agreed to send a Knox-class frigate to the disputed
waters northeast of Taiwan under strong pressure from opposition
People First Party (PFP) Legislator Ling Yu-fang after some 50 Taiwan
fishing boats staged a rare protest on the sea earlier this month
against Japanese coast guard ships' frequently chasing them away from
what they call their traditional fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng will join Legislator Lin
Yu-fang, a co-convener of the Legislature's Defense Committee, and
several other members of the committee on the voyage to the disputed
waters aboard the Knox-class frigate Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Cho-shui said dispatching a warship to protect
fishermen is dangerous and could trigger an unexpected and unwanted
conflict.</P>
      <P>"It is regrettable that some people have, simply for ideological
reasons, forced our military to do what even Chinese warships dare
not do, " Lin said. </P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan should respect international conventions,
precedents and customs in resolving fishing disputes, Lin said he is
hopeful that Tuesday's voyage will be the last time that a Taiwan
warship is mobilized to patrol a disputed maritime region.</P>
      <P>The area in dispute refers to waters close to a group of
uninhabited isles known as the Tiaoyutai Islands in Taiwan and the
Senkakus in Japan. The island group is claimed by Taiwan, China and
Japan.</P>
      <P>Lin said he thinks that the ROC government should shelve the
sovereignty dispute over the Tiaoyutais and should instead focus on
negotiations on fishing rights in the disputed waters based on
international maritime conventions, modern ecological conservation
concepts and protection of traditional fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>"We should seek co-sharing of fishery resources in disputed
waters with relevant countries and adopt appropriate measures to help
our fishermen cope with any possible impact to be brought by a new
agreement," Lin added.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Minister of
Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san has met with his
French counterpart and the two have exchanged views favorably for
bilateral cooperation in efforts to secure aviation safety.</P>
      <P>The visiting Lin, who arrived in France June 12 mainly to witness
the delivery of the fourth of eight A330-300s that China Airlines has
ordered from the French airplane giant Airbus, met with French
Minister of Transportation D. Perben June 17 for talks on issues of
mutual interest, particularly the signing of a bilateral aviation
safety agreement (BASA) between the two countries.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, although Perben is not quite familiar with
affairs of his ministry since he has been at the office for only two
weeks, the French transportation minister had a sincere and positive
attitude toward bilateral cooperation between France and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the signing of a BASA involves professional and technical
affairs, the two ministers agreed that the matter would be referred
to civil aeronautics bureaus from the two countries, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin was in Toulouse, headquarters of Airbus, June 16 to
participate in the delivery ceremony of the fourth A330-300 the China
Airlines (CAL) ordered from Airbus.</P>
      <P>As an advertisement by the Council of Agriculture to promote
sales of Taiwan's butterfly orchid, one of its most important
agricultural exports, the CAL's fourth A330-300 was painted with a
huge image of butterfly orchids on its fuselage.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of European aviation groups, Lin also attended
the Paris Air Show held June 13-16, and traveled by France's
high-speed TGV train to compare the high-speed rail systems of Japan
and Europe.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan boasts a strong industrial foundation and is
promoting its aviation industry. With Taiwan's certification on
aviation products already recognized by the United States, Taiwan
also hopes it can be recognized by the European Union, Lin added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC)
stressed Monday that it has not deferred any payments to the Taiwan
Shinkansen Corp. (TSC) and the latter has no reason not to deliver
the train carriages and core systems.</P>
      <P>Arthur Chiang, THSRC vice president, made the remarks after the
THSRC received a TSC letter to the effect that it will suspend the
delivery of train carriages and core systems. Chiang said the TSC has
already delivered 18 train carriages and is scheduled to deliver
three more in July. It is expected a total of 30 train carriages will
be delivered before the inauguration of the first high-speed rail
system in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang said his company has not delayed construction payments to
the TSC and can also pay for the July delivery.</P>
      <P>Under contract between the THSRC and the TSC, the latter has no
reason to suspend delivery, Chiang said. The THSRC will communicate
with the TSC according to the contract, but it will not overreact, he
added.</P>
      <P>He also said the goal is to have the systems become operational
on Oct. 31, but the exact time is still under assessment and will be
finalized by the end of the August.</P>
      <P>If there are any changes, the THRSC will report them, he said.</P>
      <P>The 345-kilometer high-speed railway linking Taipei in the north

able to transport at least 300,000 passengers daily when it becomes
fully operational.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Farmers' Association
(TPFA) said Monday the association will delay its trip to the
mainland originally set for this week for talks on Taiwan fruit
exports to China to make better preparations.</P>
      <P>TPFA Secretary-General Chang Yung-cheng made the remarks after
the trip to the mainland by the group resulted in criticism and
warnings that the visit could violate the law if it dared to enter an
agreement with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang said that to make fuller preparations for the trip, they
have decided to delay the visit, adding that any agreement reached
with the other side will not be outside of the law.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the talks with the mainland will not go
against government policy, or sidestep the government authorities.</P>
      <P>But he also expressed the hope that the government will attach
importance to the TPFA's intention to help farmers tap overseas
markets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP FORMALLY REQUESTS SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE SESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presented Monday an endorsement
signed by 89 lawmakers seeking an extraordinary session of the
Legislative Yuan to deal with six key bills.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, DPP caucus
whips Chao Yung-ching and William C. T. Lai urged both the governing
and opposition camps to stop bickering and devote their energy on
screening the important bills, which include flood control and
prevention, a major arms procurement bill and a nomination list of
Control Yuan members submitted by the president.</P>
      <P>Chao particularly called on the lawmakers to pay special heed to
the flood control and prevention draft bill by first approving it and
scrutinizing its budget later, because it is an urgent issue now at a
time when many townships in central and southern Taiwan are still
soaked after several days of heavy torrential downpours last week.</P>
      <P>Chao also mentioned that it is necessary to screen the
president's nominees for Control Yuan members, since a refusal by the
Legislative Yuan to do so has halted the operations of the Taiwan's
highest watchdog body for about six months, seriously affecting the
people's interests.</P>
      <P>In addition, the draft bills on restructuring the organization of
the Executive Yuan, reviewing the statute for tobacco and liquor tax
and setting up a supervisory board to monitor the laborers'
retirement fund are also waiting to be handled quickly, Chao said.</P>
      <P>As Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, a vice chairman of
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), is now busy in running for the
party's chairmanship, it will be no problem for the DPP to wait for
Wang to hold the extra legislative session after he completes his
campaigning, he said.</P>
      <P>Chao noted that other bills viewed as urgent for revision can
also be discussed in the session, such as a cross-Taiwan Strait peace
promotion bill proposed by the People First Party (PFP) and a truth
committee on the 319 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu initiated by the KMT.</P>
      <P>The DPP's proposal endorsed by 89 lawmakers asking for an
extraordinary session has exceeded a one-quarter of the 225
legislators required by the Constitution for such a gathering.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has been in an adjournment since May 31.</P>
      <P>However, KMT Central Policy Committee head Tseng Yung-chuan said
that his party is opposed to the DPP's call for opening an extra
legislative session under the anti-flood pretext.</P>
      <P>It is more important to aid the flood victims now than
programming flood control projects, Tseng said, pointing out that the
government still has at least NT$19.3 billion (US$612.7 million) in
emergency funds for natural disaster aid and relief.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh's call for an allocation of NT$80 billion
(US$2.54 billion) in an eight-year special budget for flood control
projects should be included in the government's regular annual budget
or in the five-year NT$500 billion budget for the new 10 major
development projects, he said.</P>
      <P>There is no urgent need to convene a special legislative session
to deal with anti-flood projects now and they must be well digested
with sufficient time by the lawmakers, he stressed, adding that it is
not appropriate to hold extra sessions so frequently.</P>
      <P>The KMT only called two extra legislative sessions in more than
50 years when it was the ruling party, but the DPP has held five such
sessions since it came to power in 2000, the KMT official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Chen Chih-pin prodded the DPP
government to duly carry out its relief operations instead of rushing
to call an extra legislative session at present and to get fully
prepared for the coming typhoon season.</P>
      <P>The legislature must take its time to well screen the six key
bills if they are so important as the DPP says and it would be wrong
to have them passed rashly in a special meeting, Chen Chih-pin said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) agreed to call an extra
legislative session to act on the highly sensitive arms procurement
bill and the disputed presidential nomination list for Control Yuan
members, but it is opposed to using the occasion to approve the NT$80
billion anti-flood projects.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative caucus whip David Huang said that the party is
open to including the anti-flood bill for discussion in the extra
session, but he maintained that the budgets must not be approved so
easily in such a short time on the grounds that such important
programs should be carefully crafted after measures have
comprehensively and publicly been discussed.</P>
      <P>Non-Partisan Solidarity Union legislative caucus whip Yen
Chin-piao claimed that his party has no set position regarding a
special session. But he added that the flooding in the central and
southern Taiwan requires a quick government response.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Anti-Syrian Alliance
Claims Victory in Lebanese.

Opponents of Syrian domination claimed a stunning majority
victory in the final round of Lebanon's parliamentary elections on
Sunday. An anti-Syrian alliance won at least 21 of 28 contested seats
in northern Lebanon, giving the alliance a majority in the next
128-seat Parliament. It was a startling change in the way politics
have usually been carried out here - along strict clan and religious
lines and long under the control of Syria - and perhaps an example of
a greater yearning for democracy in the Arab world. The election was
the first to be held in nearly 30 years without the presence of Syria
n troops, who arrived in 1976 early in Lebanon's civil war and were
forced to leave under international pressure in April.

Wall Street Journal: More Than Ever, Businesses Face Risk of
Prosecution.

Businesspeople and corporations are at greater risk of criminal
liability than ever before. A wave of corporate fraud starting with
the 2001 collapse of Enron Corp. has led to potent new weapons for
prosecutors such as stiffer financial penalties and prison terms. The
Securities and Exchange Commission has more money and manpower to
pursue civil-fraud cases. A list of blue-chip American companies have
submitted to the threat of criminal indictment of corporations and
become more common to accept the deferred-prosecution agreements.
Under the arrangements, the government charges the company with
criminal behavior but puts the prosecution on hold in exchange for a
promise of reform. At an agreed-upon date, the potential charges
expire. Since 2003, there have been at least eight such pacts.</TEXT>

      <P>The Taiwan-based Industrial
Technology Research Institute (ITRI) opened a business incubation
center in Silicon Valley, California Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony marking the inauguration of the center, ITRI
President Johnsee Lee said the center is part of his institute's

their own business by finding for them technology, funds and the
right personnel.</P>
      <P>Touting Taiwan as the gateway to the Asian market for scientists
and technicians in Silicon Valley, Lee said the incubation center
will help overseas Chinese who are interested in starting their own
business in Taiwan to find potential partners, helping them to
explore markets in the Asia-Pacific area, and thereby enhancing their
possibility of success.</P>
      <P>The center will provide ethnic Chinese scientists with
consultancy about starting up new ventures, technology and marketing,
and backing up their ventures with the ITRI's network in the whole of
Asia and its research and development capability, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The center will also recruit talented people to work for ITRI in
Taiwan. In the next two months, the center will search for a group of
scientists and technicians, preferable with five years of working
experience in the United States, to work at the ITRI, Lee went on.</P>
      <P>Also, the ITRI will hold an internship program for U.S.-educated
children of ethnic Chinese parents from June to August this year.
This program will offer 20 interns the chance to work at the ITRI
this summer with the purpose of preparing them for working in Taiwan
in the future.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A national energy conference opened in
Taipei Monday with business and environmental groups, think tanks and
related government officials attending.</P>
      <P>The two-day conference is aimed at charting the nation's energy
policy after the Kyoto Protocol went into effect Feb. 16. The
protocol committs 38 industrialized countries to cut their emissions
of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the conference at the Taipei
International Convention Center, Premier Frank Hsieh said the
administration is getting down to the serious business of working out
energy policies and implementation strategies that will not
compromise the environment while being acceptable to the industrial
and business sectors.</P>
      <P>He encouraged the participants to express their opinions and
share their expertise on the issue to assist the administration in
crafting workable and pragmatic energy policies.</P>
      <P>Hsieh added that related policies on reducing greenhouse gas
emissions are already in the administrative pipeline, adding that it
has been decided that solar energy will be used at venues for the
2009 World Games to be held in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i, speaking on the challenges and
opportunities after the Kyoto Protocol went into effect, said that
although Taiwan is not a signatory to the protocol, it realizes the
importance of reducing greenhouse gases in pursuing the nation's
sustainable development.</P>
      <P>The Kyoto Protocol has brought new opportunities, Wu said, noting
that it will stimulate the adjustment of the industrial structure,
improve energy structure, develop low-carbon energy and new energy
technology.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said a rudimentary
approach after the Kyoto Protocol will be to conserve energy, develop
reusable energy and upgrade energy efficiency.</P>
      <P>She expressed hope that the conference will help forge national
consensus so as to establish guidelines to resolve conflicts between
economic development and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Although not many issues are expected to be sorted out in just
two days, she expressed hope that common ground will be sought and
differences put aside for the time being.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KNOX-CLASS FRIGATE TO PATROL DISPUTED WATERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will
send a Knox-class frigate to patrol Taiwan's northeastern economic
waters Tuesday, supposedly to demonstrate the government's
determination to protect local fishermen's rights and safety,
military sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Jye, Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng and several members of the Legislative Defense
Committee will be on board the ship to inspect the navy's patrol
missions off Taiwan's east coast and how it assists in protecting
local fishermen operating in the nation's northeastern waters where
the 200-mile exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan overlap,
the sources said.</P>
      <P>The deployment of the Fengyang frigate is part of the MND's
response to a legislative demand that the navy more actively assist
in protecting local fishermen's rights to operate in the disputed
waters, the sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the MND schedule, the defense minister and lawmakers
will travel to a naval base in Suao in the northeastern county of
Ilan early Tuesday. The Fengyang is scheduled to arrive in the
disputed economic waters at around noon and to return to Suao that
afternoon.</P>
      <P>The area in dispute refers to waters close to a group of
uninhabited islets known as the Tiaoyutai Islands in Taiwan and the
Senkakus in Japan. The island group is claimed by Taiwan, China and
Japan.</P>
      <P>MND sources said the cruise will be confined to waters some 60
nautical miles off Taiwan's northeastern coast. To ensure safety,
other naval ships will patrol at distance, while military aircraft
will be on routine flight missions in the region.</P>
      <P>Military officials said the Knox-class frigates are equipped with
sophisticated sonar and anti-submarine helicopters to detect and
track submarines. They are mainly responsible for patrolling waters
off Taiwan's eastern coast.</P>
      <P>The Fengyang has recently been armed with additional air defense
weaponry systems, including the Wuchin III air defense system and
Standard I air defense missiles, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The MND agreed to send a Knox-class frigate to the disputed
waters under strong pressure from opposition People First Party (PFP)
Legislator Ling Yu-fang after some 50 Taiwan fishing boats staged a
rare protest in the area earlier this month against Japanese coast
guard ships, that frequently chase them away from what they call
their traditional fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>Besides Lin, several other lawmakers, including Legislator Lee
Wen-chung of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party -- who is also a
co-convener of the Legislative Defense Committee -- will also take
part in the inspection cruise.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vietnam has emerged as a red hot market for
Taiwan's finance industry, with banks rushing to set up footholds in
the Southeast Asian country to cash in on its economic boom, industry
sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Financial Supervisory Commission under
the Executive Yuan show that eight Taiwan-based banks, including
Chingfon Bank, Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Bank SinoPac, First
Commercial Bank, Hua Nan Commercial Bank, Cathay United Bank and
Union Bank of Taiwan, have set up 12 outlets in Vietnam -- five
branches, six representative offices and one affiliate.</P>
      <P>Eight of the establishments are in Ho Chi Minh City and four in
Hanoi.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banks are keen to seize a larger slice of the Vietnamese
market due to its high flying economy, which has attracted a large
number of Taiwan investors, making Taiwan the leading foreign
investor in Vietnam, the sources said, pointing out that Vietnam's
state-run companies, such as its water and power companies, are also
potential good clients.</P>
      <P>Although the Taiwan banking industry considers the Vietnam market
as very important, the sources pointed out that some development
difficulties remain, referring to restrictions set by the Vietnamese
government.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese government requires minimum capital investment of
US$15 million by a foreign-owned branch and a Taiwan bank in Vietnam
is limited to luring deposits that amount no more than two times of
its capital, the sources said, forecasting, however, that the
"Vietnam fever" in the Taiwan banking industry will not wane in the
short term thanks to the country's economic potential.</P>

      <P>An environmental protection official said
Monday that strategies set at the 1998 National Energy Conference to
cut greenhouse gas emissions have proved ineffective and that a
target set that year is not expected to be achieved.</P>
      <P>The second National Energy Conference was held at the Taipei
International Convention Center Monday, a two-day meeting that brings
together experts, industry representatives, scholars and government
officials to discuss structural adjustments for the use of energy in
Taiwan, as well as policies and measures that should be taken to meet
the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
      <P>At the 1998 meeting, a series of strategies were laid down with
the goal of maintaining the growth of Taiwan's greenhouse gas
emissions at the 2000 level through 2020. However, Ho Shun-chin, head
of the department of air quality protection and noise control of the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said efforts made to
achieve the goal have been a waste of time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's carbon dioxide emissions have continued to surge since
1999, Ho said, citing the latest EPA statistics.</P>
      <P>The official also noted that the average annual growth rate of
carbon dioxide emissions among Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) member states reached 0.98 percent, while
Taiwan posted an increase rate of over 6 percent. She suggested that
Taiwan should learn from the organization, which has helped its

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE ENVOY EXPRESSES STANCE ON FISHING DISPUTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The de facto Japanese ambassador to Taipei
paid a visit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Monday to
express Japan's stance on Taiwan's plan to send a naval ship to
patrol disputed waters where the 200-mile exclusive economic zones of
Taiwan and Japan overlap.</P>
      <P>Tadashi Ikeda, director of the Taipei Office of the Japanese
Interchange Association (JIA) , was quoted as having told MOFA
officials that international fishing disputes should be resolved
through negotiations instead of by deploying warships. JIA is a
quasi-official body authorized to handle Taiwan-Japan exhcnages in
the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Ikeda further said the Japanese government considers Taiwan's
decision to send a military vessel to the disputed waters for an
afternoon -- a stunt dreamed up by opposition lawmakers supposedly to
demonstrate determination to protect Taiwan's fishing rights -- to be
"inappropriate."</P>
      <P>The Japanese envoy was also quoted as having stressed that if
Taiwan decides to go ahead with its warship deployment, the vessel
should not traverse the middle line of the two countries' overlapping
economic zones. Otherwise, Ikeda said, the Japanese government cannot
guarantee whether or not it will take action in response.</P>
      <P>The area in dispute refers to waters close to a group of
uninhabited islets known as the Tiaoyutai Islands in Taiwan and the
Senkakus in Japan. The island group is claimed by Taiwan, China and
Japan.</P>
      <P>Ikeda's message came shortly after the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) announced that a Knox-class frigate will be sent to
patrol Taiwan's northeastern economic waters Tuesday. According to
the MND announcement, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye,
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and several members of the
Legislative Defense Committee will be on board the ship to inspect
the navy's patrol missions off Taiwan's east coast and how it assists
in protecting local fishermen operating in the disputed northeastern
economic waters.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials refused to comment on Ikeda's message from the
Japanese government, saying only that the MOFA has informed the
defense minister of Japan's stance on the issue.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said they will keep a close watch on whether the
frigate patrol will affect the 15th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery
talks scheduled to take place in July.</P>
      <P>The MOFA was originally scheduled to call an interministerial
meeting Tuesday to work out strategies for the upcoming new round of
Taiwan-Japanese fishery talks. But MOFA officials said the meeting
will be postponed because Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Michael
Ying-mao Kau, who is to preside over the interministerial meeting,
will be otherwise engaged that day.</P>
      <P>The deployment of the frigate is part of the MND's response to a
legislative demand that the navy more actively assist in protecting
local fishermen's rights to operate in the disputed waters, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the MND schedule, the defense minister and lawmakers

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China said
Monday that it requires patience to bring about a meeting between the
presidents on each side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hsiung, chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation, made the remarks in an exclusive interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that some said after meetings between the leaders of
the two largest opposition parties -- Lien Chan of the Kuomintang and
James Soong of the People First Party -- with Chinese President Hu
Jintao in April and May, respectively, that President Chen Shui-bian
might feel an urgent need fo a meeting with Hu. In fact, the
president has no such feeling, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang said the international community hopes there will be
cross-strait government-to-government dialogue, adding that Chen, who
is committed to improving cross-strait relations and the people's
welfare, also hopes for a meeting with Hu.</P>
      <P>However, both sides should start dialogue first and build up
mutual trust and understanding before such high-level dialogue can
take place, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"A hasty Chen-Hu meeting will get us nowhere, " Chang said,
adding that such a meeting requires gradual and patient promotion.</P>
      <P>Chang added that issues concerning the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will not be decided unilaterally.</P>
      <P>He also said that when the time is ripe, he is willing to meet
with his counterpart Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Exchanges of visits will have positive effects on cross-strait
relations, Chang said, adding that he would welcome more exchange and
communications between Beijing and the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Faced with what he claimed is the more flexible, softer approach
of Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao toward Taiwan, he also said Taiwan must
re-forge internal consensus.</P>
      <P>He said the Taiwan people displayed bravery in the face of
China's missile threats, but now Beijing has launched a charm
offensive by inviting opposition leaders to visit and by offering
zero-tariff treatment for Taiwan's agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>"I must admit, Taiwan people are not used to this kind of
offensive," Chang added.</P>
      <P>He said that he has suggested several times that the DPP adjust
its strategy and that the party "must let the people know about the
advocacy of the government, " especially the advocacy of
"reconciliation and symbiosis" and the "maintaining of the status

Senkakus in Japan. The island group is claimed by Taiwan, China and
Japan.</P>
      <P>The MND official said the frigate that will be on the patrol
mission Tuesday will cruise within the area some 60 nautical miles
off Taiwan's east coast. The area is open sea and the vessel will not
traverse the "temporary demarcation line" set by the government for
the nation's coast guard patrol ships to police.</P>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Jye, Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng and several members of the Legislative Defense
Committee will be on board the 4,200-ton frigate -- the Fengyang --
to inspect the navy's patrol missions off Taiwan's east coast and how
it assists in protecting local fishermen operating in the disputed
northeastern economic waters.</P>
      <P>The MND agreed to deploy the frigate under strong pressure from
opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Ling Yu-fang after
some 50 Taiwan fishing boats staged a rare protest in the area
earlier this month against Japanese coast guard ships that frequently
chase them away from what they call their traditional fishing
grounds.</P>
      <P>Besides Lin, several other lawmakers, including Legislator Lee
Wen-chung of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party -- who is also a
co-convener of the Legislative Defense Committee -- will take part in
the inspection cruise.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HOPES TO SIGN FTA WITH GUATEMALA IN AUGUST</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
Guatemalan President Ocar Berger Perdomo has agreed to visit Taiwan
in August and that he hopes to sign a Taiwan-Guatemala free trade
agreement (FTA) with him by that time.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received Jorge Mendez
Herbruger, president of the Guatemalan Congress, at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Chen said he invited Berger recently for a visit, and the latter
agreed to take part in the inauguration of the Democratic Pacific
Union initiated by Vice President Annette Lu in mid-August and
deliver a keynote speech at the event.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan and Guatemala have close trade and economic
relations, that FTA talks are progressing smoothly and that he is
confident the two sides can sign the agreement during Berger's visit.</P>
      <P>He expressed appreciation that the Guatemalan Congress has since
1991 had a group friendly to Taiwan and that it has passed
resolutions every year to support Taiwan's bid to join the United

    <HEADLINE>NEXT 3 YEARS PRIME TIME FOR TALKS WITH CHINA: SEF CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>From now to 2008 is the prime time for
talks between Taiwan and China, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang noted in a CNA interview that President Chen Shui-bian's
term still has three years to go, that Beijing is gearing up to host
the 2008 Olympics and that both Taiwan and China will enjoy a
relative stable period conducive to the establishment of a peaceful
framework between Taiwan and China through dialogue.</P>
      <P>With the mandate of the people, Chen is fully authorized to talk
with China and if China wants to improve ties with Taiwan it should
talk to the popularly elected president rather than any opposition
parties, Chang pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing triggered so-called "China fever" in Taiwan by
inviting two opposition leaders to visit in April and May and giving
them red-carpet welcomes, the international community still believes
Beijing should talk to the president, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Any agreement Beijing has concluded with the opposition parties
will not necessarily be translated into policy in Taiwan unless it is
approved by the government, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although he is a member of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, Chang said he has always advocated improved ties with Beijing
and is therefore a suitable head for the SEF.</P>
      <P>He denied that his SEF chairmanship is a sinecure and a form of
patronage given to him by President Chen Shui-bian, arguing that he
is not being paid for his duties.</P>
      <P>He also denied that the SEF, a quasi-official body set up to deal
with China on behalf of the government, has been swept to the
sidelines after Premier Frank Hsieh asked two private groups this
month to negotiate with China over the issues of bilateral charter
flights and the trade of fruit, saying that his foundation supports a
pragmatic approach toward issues with China and does not care about
being passed over for these tasks.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chang explained, although Beijing has severed
contacts with SEF since 1999 for political reasons, the problems of
mutual concern cannot wait until a thaw in bilateral relations and if
private groups can sort out such issues before the SEF resumes
contact with its Beijing counterparts, "then that's all right."</P>
      <P>As the chief of the SEF, Chang said, he would like to see a
resumption of contact as soon as possible, but he added that it is
beyond the ambit of his foundation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER HOPES TO VISIT CHINA IN CAPACITY AS PARTY HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Monday that if elected chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
he will not rule out the possibility of visiting China in his
capacity as the party's head.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, he also said that if elected in the
July 16 election, he will integrate the KMT's allies -- the New Party
and the People First Party (PFP) -- in the "pan-blue alliance" so as
to regain power in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Only by doing so will there be hope for cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, he claimed, adding that this is because the KMT advocates
the so-called "1992 consensus" -- referring to what it claims was a
tacit unwritten agreement to allow different interpretations to the
meaning of "one China" in cross-strait talks in Hong Kong in 1992
that led to the first high-level talks the following year after a
hiatus of nearly five decades.</P>
      <P>In this way, Beijing would be willing to come to the negotiation
table and it would be possible to set up direct cross-strait
transportation links, establish military buffer zones and sign a
cross-strait peace agreement, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is the convener of a group on cross-strait affairs in
the legislature, said that if he visits China in his speakership
capacity, he would have to go under the premise of national need,
public agreement and legislative resolution, as well as equality and
dignity.</P>
      <P>The timing for these conditions is not ripe, Wang went on.
Comparatively, the condition to travel to China in his capacity as
the KMT head is more lax, he added. </P>
      <P>On cross-strait policy, Wang said that if elected KMT chairman,
he will reactivate the National Unification Guidelines and the
National Unification Committee, which have been moribund since
President Chen Shui-bian took office for his first term in 2000.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that recent visits of China by KMT Chairman Lien
Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong have brought a positive atmosphere
to cross-strait exchanges, but as the opposition parties have no
government authority, the momentum for such exchanges cannot
continue.</P>
      <P>If the "pan-blue alliance" wins the 2008 presidential election,
cross-strait relations will naturally warm up, according to Wang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN HOPEFUL TOUTS HIMSELF AS BEST CHOICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
touted himself as the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) best choice for
party chief Monday, claiming that only a party chief who doubles as
the legislature speaker can solve the thorny problems plaguing the
KMT.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, the KMT vice chairman who is running
for the chairmanship said the two problems facing the party are the
handling of its alleged ill-gotten assets and its cooperation with
the People First Party (PFP) in the year-end elections of county and
city chiefs.</P>
      <P>In order to dispose of its assets, Wang claimed, the KMT has to
break through what he described as the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) government's "blockage."</P>
      <P>As the legislature speaker, and, if elected, chairman of the KMT
-- which controls 80 seats in the Legislative Yuan -- Wang claimed he
can unite with other political allies in the legislature to keep the
DPP government in check by holding the government's purse-strings
tightly and enacting laws.</P>
      <P>If he takes the reins of the KMT, Wang claimed, his role and
experience as the legislature speaker will stand him in good stead
when he searches for party candidates for the year-end elections, and
will give KMT the best hope for victory.</P>
      <P>Noting that the PFP has floated three prerequisites for a
possible merger with KMT, including the retirement of Lien Chan,
stopping "patronizing" the PFP and combining the KMT and the PFP into
a new party, Wang claimed he can meet all three conditions without
problems.</P>
      <P>He said Lien has decided to retire and added: "I am not the
person who will throw his weight around and I will treat the PFP on
an equal footing."</P>
      <P>Actually, Wang said, the KMT needs the PFP's support in the
legislature while disposing of its controversial assets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP SHOULD BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ARMS PROCUREMENT DELAY: KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan said in a letter sent recently to a group of members of the U.S.
House of Representatives that Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party government should bear responsibility for the deadlock that has
prevented Taiwan from purchasing U.S. arms.</P>
      <P>Thirty U.S. House representatives, including Henry J. Hyde
, chairman of the House International Relations Committee, sent a
co-signed letter to Lien on May 27, saying that the failure of
Taiwan's legislature to pass the special budget for the arms
procurement has raised U.S. concerns about Taiwan's ability to defend
itself against potential Chinese aggression.</P>
      <P>In the letter, they urged Lien and his party to support the U.S.
arms procurement plan and help push the Legislative Yuan to pass the
relevant bill as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Pointing out in his letter to the U.S. lawmakers that the
Kuomintang has always believed in credible defense capabilities while
advocating peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, Lien said that
his party also believes that political prudence should go hand in
hand with a strong deterrence, while not trying to unilaterally
change the status quo.</P>
      <P>"For these reasons, the KMT actively supported military
procurements over the past five decades when it was in power, and it
will continue to do so in the future," he noted.</P>
      <P>Touching on the current arms procurement plan, the KMT head said
that although U.S. President George W, Bush approved the arms sales
package to Taiwan in April 2001, which includes diesel submarines,
anti-submarine aircraft and PAC-3, the current DPP administration in
Taiwan procrastinated for three years and did not present a special
budget request, for NT$610.8 billion, until June 2, 2004, only nine
days before the legislative session was set to end.</P>
      <P>"The long delay could only be due to administrative incompetence
or lack of political leadership, and certainly not to legislative or
partisan obstruction," Lien claimed.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan lawmakers were preoccupied with their
re-election campaigns after the autumn session began in September
last year and therefore, serious debate only began early this year
when the new legislature convened. Although Lien admitted that this
represented a long delay, he pointed out that the DPP administration
was well aware of Taiwan's political calendar.</P>
      <P>"To try to squeeze the arms package through the legislature in
June 2004, in my view, bespeaks a lack of serious intent on the part
of the DPP administration," Lien added.</P>
      <P>Regarding the funds needed to purchase the U.S. arms, the
Ministry of National Defence first indicated to the Defense Committee
of the Legislative Yuan in a closed-door session in May 2002 a figure
of NT$280 billion, although no budget request was presented at the
time, Lien noted. He added that nobody in the DPP government ever
explained to the nation why the price suddenly skyrocketed to
NT$610.8 billion in June 2004.</P>
      <P>"Now the figure has been reduced to NT$480 billion because of
exchange rate fluctuations and the dumping of the so-called 'domestic
assembly' plan for the submarines, but there is still a large
discrepancy between this figure and the 2002 figure as reported in
the press," Lien continued.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT head, other important questions on Taiwan's
domestic debate on the military procurement issue stand out,
including why everything was lumped together in a special budget
request and nothing included in the regular annual budget. He said
that some legislators believe that the annual budget should be used
as much as possible for the arms procurement, and then a special
budget could be considered.</P>
      <P>To the surprise and dismay of many supporters of the arms
package, the DPP administration first presented it in two scanty
pages in June 2004, Lien said. Since then, the Ministry of National
Defense's explanations have been nothing more than a few sporadic and
brief pages and slides, he noted, saying it is no wonder that some
political commentators have joked that the DPP administration has

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian himself also committed a serious blunder
by insisting on holding a referendum on the same day as the last
presidential election on whether or not Taiwan should purchase the
PAC-3s, only to see the referendum result nullified as less than half

Legislative Yuan's hands are tied, at least on this issue, by Article
30 of the Referendum Act.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Legislative Yuan is now in summer recess, Lien

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER URGES SAFEGUARDING OF SOVEREIGNTY, FISHERY RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng on
Tuesday urged a show of resolve to safeguard the Republic of China's
sovereignty and local fishermen's rights before he boarded a
Knox-class frigate that was to travel to a disputed area northeast of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang and several members of the Legislative Defense Committee,
accompanied by Minister of National Defense Lee Jye, boarded the
4,200-ton frigate -- the "Fengyang" -- at 9: 30 p.m. to inspect the
ROC Navy's patrol missions off Taiwan's east coast and how it assists
in protecting local fishermen operating in the disputed northeastern
economic waters.</P>
      <P>The area in dispute refers to waters close to a group of
uninhabited islets known as the Tiaoyutai Islands in Taiwan and the
Senkakus in Japan. The island group is claimed by Taiwan, China and
Japan.</P>
      <P>"From historical, geographical and legal perspectives, it is
without question that the Tiaoyutais are Republic of China territory
and that they have always been under the jurisdiction of the ROC," he
said.</P>
      <P>Wang said, "I couldn't disagree more" with the statement in 2002
by former President Lee Teng-hui during an interview in which he said
that the islands in question are a part of Japanese territory.</P>
      <P>He said that the Tiaoyutais are the territory of the ROC, and it
is an unalienable right to safeguard the integrity of the sovereignty
of the nation.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais, located 120 nautical miles off Taiwan, are under
the jurisdiction of Ilan County with a postal code of 290, Wang said,
adding that it is "unacceptable" that Japanese patrol boats arrest
Taiwan fishermen operating in waters near the Tiaoyutais.</P>
      <P>He said that taking a "meek and mild" approach to Japan will
not solve the problem, and will only convince local fishermen that
they will have to take matters into their own hands. Wang added that
without the recent large protest by local fishermen, Japan would most
likely not have been interested in coming to the negotiating table
for a new round of talks.</P>
      <P>He urged the government not to be weak on matters concerning
national sovereignty, stressing that it is possible to share marine
and mineral resources, and that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can
jointly tap the Tiaoyutais with Japan, but the government's attitude
toward its sovereignty should be unequivocal.</P>
      <P>Wang urged the public to show solidarity and protest the
unreasonable behavior of the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>The "Fengyang" cruised within the areas some 60 nautical miles
off Taiwan's east coast and is expected to return to Suao harbor
around 5 p.m. after completing its mission.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense agreed to deploy the frigate
under strong pressure from opposition People First Party Legislator
Lin Yu-fang after some 50 Taiwan fishing boats staged a rare protest
in the area earlier this month against Japanese coast guard ships
that frequently chase them away from what they call their traditional
fishing grounds.</P>

      <P>The deployment of a Knox-class frigate on
Tuesday to disputed waters in the East China Sea will not lead to
conflict between Taiwan and Japan, Michel Lu, the spokesman for the

      <P>Lu noted that the 15th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks, which

      <P>The two countries are in the process of setting a date for the

      <P>MOFA was originally scheduled to call an interministerial meeting
Tuesday to work out strategies for the planned fishery talks. But the

      <P>The upcoming negotiations will be centered on seeking reasonable

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is firm in its stance in
safeguarding the nation's sovereignty and fishermen's rights, Premier
Frank Hsieh reiterated Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The premier was responding to questions regarding recent fishery
disputes between Taiwan and Japan over overlapping economic zones
when he attended an inauguration ceremony of the Taitung Veterans
General Hospital in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the disputes are triggered by overlapping
economic zones between Taiwan and Japan, and both sides will re-start
negotiation on the matter at the end of this month.</P>
      <P>He said that each side can claim sovereignty and focus on the
disputed parts. As the Republic of China has no diplomatic relations
with Japan, the process may have some twists and turns, he
added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng boarded a
military vessel to travel to the disputed waters northeast of Taiwan
to support fishermen's rights and to uphold the nation's sovereignty,
Hsieh said the move will show the seriousness of the matter and put
it in international spotlight, which he said will be favorable for
fishery talks with Japan.</P>
      <P>But he expressed the hope that the fishermen will not take the
matter into their own hands lest they hurt their own interests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman of the Executive Yuan said that the
government will never flinch on its stance of protecting fishermen's
rights and safeguarding of nation's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai said the Cabinet welcomes any groups or individuals
to show their resolve on the matter based on national interests, but
it would also like to see them act rationally.</P>
      <P>He also said that Wang and legislators boarding the 4,200-ton

heard in the international community.</P>
      <P>According to recent reports by ROC missions overseas, Japan has

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's national archery
team attending the 43rd World Outdoor Target Archery Championship
being held in Madrid June 20-26 lodged a protest against what the
team called unfair treatment they received from the organizer of the
event.</P>
      <P>According to Lee Ching-ping, president of the ROC 's Archery
Association, instead of allowing the team to use its "Chinese Taipei"
flag decorated with Olympic rings to attend the opening ceremony, the
organizer insisted that archers from Taiwan should be present at the
ceremony under an ROC national flag.</P>
      <P>Although the team told the organizer that it cannot attend any
international sport event under the ROC's national flag based on the
rules of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and that violating
such rules might lead the Chinese archery team to protest, the
organizer still wanted the team to follow their instructions,
promising that they would bear the responsibility if the Chinese team
protested.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, a ranking official of the International Archery
Federation (FITA) , requested that the ROC team not use the national
flag at the last minute before the opening ceremony began. Such an
action immediately led ROC archers to lodge a protest to express
their dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>Lee also requested after a discussion on the matter with newly
elected FITA President Ugur Erdener that the organizer must give a
clear response on how they will deal with flag-hoisting issues if
Taiwan wins medals at the event.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of James L. Easton, former FITA president and
incumbent IOC vice president, the FITA officials eventually promised
that the ROC team can attend all the activities of the event under
the "Chinese Taipei" flag.</P>

      <P>Chen received a warm welcome from more than 100 Taiwan
expatriates while attending a reception in Silicon Valley shortly

      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Chen said relations between Taiwan and

Democratic Progressive Party administration has proved that Taiwan is
not a troublemaker.</P>
      <P>"President Chen Shui-bian has on numerous occasions stressed that
Taiwan is an independent sovereign country with its sovereignty
resting in its 23 million people and that Taiwan is determined to

      <P>Chen Hung began to have trouble walking in 1997, with his muscles
gradually atrophying and eventually he could not even swallow food.
The early symptoms made doctors think that Chen had had a stroke, and
it was not until 1999 that he was confirmed to have ALS/MND

that affect some 350,000 people around the world, and kills more than
100,000 each year.</P>
      <P>Disease is also commonly called Lou Gehrig's Disease and Maladie
de Charcot, after Jean-Martin Charcot, the French neurologist who
first described it in 1869.</P>
      <P>The disease did not defeat Chen, although now he can only
communicate with the outside world by blinking his eyes.</P>
      <P>Chen began to "write" books with the help of his wife, blinking
his eyes to represent Chinese phonetic symbols.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony to introduce his third book, the president said
Chen adopted the adage: "Where there is life, there is hope."</P>
      <P>The president stressed that Chen has never given up, and no one

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Cabinet official denied Tuesday a claim
by opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government should be held
responsible for the deadlock facing the country's latest arms
procurement plan from the United States.</P>
      <P>In a letter sent recently to a group of members of the U.S. House
of Representatives, Lien accused the DPP government of
procrastinating for three years before it presented a special budget
request for NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) in June 2004 to buy a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, six Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries and eight diesel-electric submarines.</P>
      <P>Although the amount of the procurement was later reduced to
NT$480 billion because of exchange rate fluctuations and the
exclusion of a plan to assemble the submarines in Taiwan, the Cabinet
failed to explain to the nation why the figure skyrocketed from the
originally disclosed NT$280 billion, Lien said.</P>
      <P>Lien also mentioned that a referendum held last year on whether
to purchase more anti-missile armaments was declared invalid because
less than half of the eligible voters took part in the poll.</P>
      <P>However, Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said none of what Lien
said is true.</P>
      <P>Cho said the government did not delay the budget submission and
that it is the KMT that has been blocking the bill from being
included in the Legislative Yuan's agenda.</P>
      <P>On the amount of the procurement, Cho said legislators can always
raised the issue for discussion when they review the budget plan.</P>
      <P>Also, the referendum on the anti-missile armaments failed because
Lien was asking "pan-blue" supporters to boycott the referendum, Cho
noted.</P>
      <P>He said the Cabinet hopes that the legislature will call a
special session in July to review the proposed budget for the arms
procurement package.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, the Cabinet expects the legislature to pass the
proposed budget as soon as possible during the next legislative
session starting in September, he added.</P>

Tuesday.</P>

oppose to such a move.</P>
      <P>But Chen also said that both Taiwan and Japan should refrain from
adopting provocative actions over disputes triggered by overlapping

      <P>Japanese media prominently reported on the ROC government's
deployment of a frigate to the disputed waters, but the Japanese
government has responded in a low-profile manner.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Democrats Block a Vote on
Bolton for the Second Time.

For the second time in a month, U.S. Senate Democrats blocked a
vote on Monday evening on the nomination of John R. Bolton to be
ambassador to the United Nations, raising the possibility that
President Bush will circumvent the confirmation process and appoint
Bolton when Congress recesses. The vote, a setback for both President
Bush and Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, came
after the White House chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., made a
fruitless attempt to negotiate an end to the impasse with one of
Bolton's chief Democratic opponents, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of
Delaware. With Biden and other Democrats holding firm in their demand
for the White House to release information relating to Bolton, his
future is unclear.

Wall Street Journal: As Oil Prices Swing, Gas-Station Owners Try
Futures Market.

The gas-station business in the United States is in turmoil,
largely because of wildly zigzagging energy prices. With oil prices
once again hitting record highs, profit margins have been squeezed
for operators from mom-and-pop independents to the company-owned
stations of Exxon Mobil Corp. A growing number of gas-station owners
are now using the futures markets, up from almost nothing two decades
ago. That tally doesn't count giant integrated oil companies such as
Chevron Corp. or Exxon Mobil, which have been active in the futures
markets for decades.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ratio of electronic exports to Taiwan's
total exports surged to 23.3 percent last year from the 1995 level of
14.6 percent, while that of exports of information and communications
manufacturers dropped to 7.4 percent from 13.2 percent in 2000,
according to the latest official statistics released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A report compiled by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that industrial exports took
the lion's share of exports in 2004, with a ratio of 98.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The report about changes in Taiwan's trade structure in the past
10 years indicates that the drop in exports by the information and
communications sector resulted from increasing relocation of the
industry overseas.</P>
      <P>In terms of imports, agricultural and industrial raw materials
increased in both 2003 and 2004, with increases of over 7 percent
recorded in each of the two years.</P>
      <P>In the capital equipment sector, the ratio of imports posed a
slight growth to 21.4 percent last year from the 20.5 percent
recorded in the previous year, according to the report.</P>
      <P>In its analysis of overseas markets, the DGBAS said China and
Hong Kong surpassed the United States to become Taiwan's largest
market, accounting for 36.7 percent of the country's exports last
year, an increase of 13 percentage points from the 1995 level.</P>
      <P>The share of exports to the U.S. market in 2004 dropped to 16.2

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will suggest that Japan shelf their
conflicting sovereignty claims to waters where the two countries'
200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone overlap and jointly manage
them, Lee Jen-chyuan, vice chairman of the Council of Agriculture
(COA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Emerging from a meeting of the Central Standing Committee of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, Lee told journalists that under
the proposal of his office, both Taiwan and Japan should stop
enforcing their laws in the overlapping zone to calm the disputes
over Taiwan fishermen's right to fish in this area.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, maritime sources in this area should be managed and
protected jointly by Taiwan and Japan, and both Japanese and
Taiwanese fishermen can operate in this area, Lee said.</P>
      <P>This proposal will be raised at the 15th Taiwan-Japan fishing
talks, which are expected to begin in July, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He refused to say whether or not Japan would accept this
suggestion.</P>
      <P>The COA's proposal is aimed at addressing local fishermen's
complaints that they are chased away or arrested by Japanese coast
guard for fishing in these controversial waters between Taiwan and
Japan, especially near the Tiaoyutai Islands, which are claimed by
both Japan and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government is under great pressure to deal with the issue
after a recent series of news reports about Taiwan fishermen being
arrested by Japanese coast guard and being fined heavily in this

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers of the "pan-green camp" of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) urged opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
Tuesday to support their proposal to hold a special legislative
session to review the Cabinet-proposed budget for a NT$480 billion
(US$15.33 billion) arms procurement package from the United States.</P>
      <P>Calling Lien's attention to the continued military buildup by
China and its threat to the security of Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific
region, William C.T. Lai, a whip of the DPP's legislative caucus,
said Lien should be responsible to history.</P>
      <P>Lai was responding to Lien's claim that the DPP government should
be held responsible for the deadlock facing the arms procurement
plan.</P>
      <P>In a letter sent recently to a group of members of the U.S. House
of Representatives, Lien accused the DPP government of
procrastinating for three years before it presented a special budget
request for NT$610.8 billion in June 2004 to buy a squadron of 12
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, six Patriot PAC-III anti-missile
batteries and eight diesel-electric submarines.</P>
      <P>Although the amount of the procurement was later reduced to
NT$480 billion because of exchange rate fluctuations and the
exclusion of a plan to assemble the submarines in Taiwan, the Cabinet
failed to explain to the nation why the figure skyrocketed from the
originally disclosed NT$280 billion, Lien said.</P>
      <P>Lien also mentioned that a referendum held last year on whether
to purchase more anti-missile armaments was declared invalid because
less than half of the eligible voters took part in the poll.</P>
      <P>Lai expressed his regret over Lien's allegations, saying it is
the KMT that has for the past two legislative sessions been blocking
the budget bill from being included in the legislature's agenda.</P>
      <P>Lai said there has not been a huge discrepancy in the amount for
the procurement as Lien has claimed, with the exception of that which
is a result of changes made to reflect exchange rate fluctuations and
the exclusion of a plan to assemble the submarines in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, convener of the TSU legislative caucus, called Lien a
liar for blaming the DPP for the deadlock of the arms procurement
plan.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, the amount of the procurement skyrocketed mainly
because the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and People First Party
(PFP) insisted that the submarines be assembled in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, the KMT and PFP have jointly obstructed the inclusion of
the budget bill in the legislature's agenda on as many as 72
occasions, Ho pointed out.</P>
      <P>However, PFP Legislator Chang Hsien-yao, who also serves as
director of the party's Policy Research Center, said the PFP strongly
opposes holding a special legislative session to review the arms
procurement plan and financing the procurement with a special budget.</P>
      <P>In addition, the PFP will continue to boycott the procurement
unless President Chen Shui-bian apologizes for his unfounded claim
that PFP Chairman James Soong had met secretly in the United States
with Chen Yunlin, head of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chieh-ju, secretary-general of the minority
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, said his party supports the arms
procurement but believes adjustments should be made to its amount and
items to avoid wasting money.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT ABANDON INDUSTRY FOR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An industrial leader urged the government
Tuesday not to abandon any industry in order to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.</P>
      <P>Hou Chen-hsiung, chairman of Taipei-based Chinese National
Federation of Industries, made the remarks at a national conference
in Taipei aimed at working out countermeasures in response to the
implementation of Kyoto Protocol, which aims to limit the global
emission of greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>While urging heavy energy-consuming industries to upgrade their
production processes and equipment, Hou also suggested that the
government cooperate with Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central
America in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto
Protocol.</P>
      <P>Under the CDM, industrialized countries can invest in greenhouse
gas emission reduction projects in developing countries and to buy
carbon dioxide credits for reductions achieved in these countries.</P>
      <P>According to Hou, Taiwan's energy structure, the ratio of each
type of energy, as well as its total energy policy, should be
reviewed completely to reach the carbon dioxide emission reduction
target set for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that no country has ever abandoned any industry for the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, Hou said that by improving
equipment and adopting advanced production technology, the country
can easily reach its goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and
industrial upgrading at the same time.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government present a comprehensive
industrial development policy to cope with the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
      <P>The government should hold constant dialogues with industry
representatives, set up greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for
the various industries, offer incentives for reductions, create a
policy or an environment friendly to the reduction, as well as
encourage entrepreneurs to participate in CDM projects, Hou added.</P>
      <P>However, environmentalist Chang Tze-chien from Yunlin County
expressed a different opinion, describing heavy energy-consuming
industries as being like high-calorie junk food and claiming they
cannot upgrade their energy use efficiency.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan has passed the era when heavy
energy-consuming industries played a pivotal role in pushing the
country's economic growth, Chang urged the government to limit the
development of these industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP PANS LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER OVER WARSHIP DEPLOYMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng has
set a bad example of the legislature encroaching upon the
administrative power by demanding that the military send a warship to
patrol a disputed part of the East China Sea, a ruling party lawmaker
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kao Chih-peng of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) made the remarks after Wang, accompanied by Minister of
National Defense Lee Jye and more than 10 lawmakers, made a rare
voyage aboard a Knox-class frigate earlier in the day to the disputed
waters northeast of Taiwan where the 200-mile exclusive economic
zones of Taiwan and Japan overlap.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly meeting of the DPP Central Standing
Committee, Kao said Wang was using the warship deployment as no more
than a campaign gimmick to boost his chances of winning the July 17
chairmanship election of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) agreed to dispatch the
Knox-class frigate -- the Fengyang -- to the disputed waters under
strong pressure from Wang and opposition People First Party (PFP)
Legislator Ling Yu-fang after some 50 Taiwan fishing boats staged a
rare protest in the area earlier this month against Japanese coast
guard ships that frequently chase them away from what they call their
traditional fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>Kao said he is worried that Wang's forcing the military to deploy
the Fengyang to the disputed waters could mark the start of the
legislature infringing upon administrative powers and functions.</P>
      <P>During the DPP meeting, Coast Guard Administration Minister
Shi Hwei-you and Council of Agriculture Vice Chairman Lee Chien-chuan
gave briefings on the fishing ground disputes between Taiwan and
Japan.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said after listening to their
briefings that the Taiwan-Japan fishery disputes involve a host of
complicated problems, including the sovereignty over the Taioyutai
Islands, the protection of local fishermen and the demarcation of the
nation's 200-mile economic zone.</P>
      <P>In addition to taking active steps to protect local fishermen's
rights and safety, Su said the government should also work to resolve
the fishing ground disputes with Japan through negotiations as soon
as possible.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's fishing disputes with Japan as a

Tiaoyutai Islands and should be sorted out in bilateral fishery
talks, the premier said.</P>
      <P>He urged local fishermen to avoid conflicts with Japanese patrol
boats by fishing within Taiwan's temporary law enforcement line where
they will get the government's complete protection.</P>
      <P>The premier also recommended that fishermen install global

avoid unwittingly trespassing into Japan's exclusive economic zone.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTER: FISHERY PROTECTION MISSION NOT NAVY'S JOB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fishery protection mission is not the
navy's main responsibility, but it would like to show its solidarity
with local fishermen in their disputes with Japan over their right to
fish in waters northeast of Taiwan, Minister of National Defense Lee
Jye said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>After accompanying Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng and a
dozen lawmakers on a fishery protection mission to the
country's territorial waters northeast of Taiwan aboard a navy
frigate, the minister said he did not think it is a good idea to
assign navy warships exclusively to protect fishermen's rights and
interests at sea.</P>
      <P>The armed force's primary job is to ensure the country's security
and it will protect fishermen's rights only as a sidenote to this,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said he agreed to take lawmakers aboard the frigate on a
cruise of the country's northeastern territorial waters after a
demand by Wang.</P>
      <P>He denied the cruise was no more than a political stunt staged at
the request of lawmakers, claiming that the mission was to
demonstrate the government's determination to protect the fishermen.</P>
      <P>He shrugged off a statement by Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara
Tuesday that the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands are Japanese territory
and should be protected at whatever cost, including war.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutai Islands, known as Senkaku Islands in Japan, lie 102
miles northeast of Taiwan and are claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan.
Taiwan fishermen are often chased away from waters near the islands
by Japanese patrol boats.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COAL TO BECOME TAIWAN'S LARGEST ENERGY SOURCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Coal will become Taiwan's largest energy
source by 2020, accounting for 40 percent to 42 percent of the
country's total energy supply, according to an adjusted national
energy structure approved Tuesday by the national energy conference.</P>
      <P>At the same time, petroleum will be the country's second-largest
energy source at 32 percent, followed by natural gas at 14 percent to
18 percent, nuclear energy at 7 percent and reusable energy at 4
percent to 6 percent, the newly approved national energy structure
shows.</P>
      <P>In 2025, it continues, energy generated from coal will account
for 41 percent to 45 percent of the country's total energy supply,
followed by petroleum at 30 percent to 31 percent, natural gas at 16
percent to 19 percent, reusable energy at 5 percent to 7 percent and
nuclear energy at 4 percent.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said the conference
decided to increase the country's energy reliance on coal given that
the existing global coal reserves are estimated to supply the world's
consumption for some 200 years, far longer than petroleum reserves.</P>
      <P>With respect to carbon dioxide emissions, Ho said Taiwan will
adopt a "clean coal" measure to reduce pollution.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she added, Taiwan will continue to decrease the use of

    <HEADLINE>FORCE SHOULD BE LAST RESORT IN DISPUTE-SETTLEMENT: COAST GUARD CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The military option is the last resort of
settling disputes between countries and should not be used
in the country's current fishing disputes with Japan, Coast Guard
Administration (CGA) Minister Shi Hwei-yow said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Shi said under a 1998 act, the Ministry
of National Defense is charged with the defense of the country's
territorial waters and exclusive economic zone and the enforcement of
the country's laws in these waters, but that was before the
establishment of the CGA.</P>
      <P>Since the CGA came into place in 2000, a division of labor took
place between the CGA and the navy, with the coast guard enforcing
the country's law while the navy defends national security on
the high seas.</P>
      <P>In ironing out the fishing disputes with Japan, Shi suggested
the government have recourse to diplomatic negotiations, followed by
CGA patrols in controversial areas to turn up the
heat on the Tokyo authorities, with the navy as the last option.</P>
      <P>He made the comments when a dozen lawmakers led by Legislative
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng cruised the controversial waters aboard a navy
frigate Tuesday in an attempt to stress the country's territorial
claim.</P>
      <P>However, Shi said, Taiwan is a democracy and the administration
attaches great importance to public opinion. By deploying
the warship, the government can restore the fishermen's confidence,
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EQUIP TAIWAN FISHING BOATS WITH GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEMS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh instructed the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) and Coast Guard
Administration (CGA) Wednesday to provide financial assistance to
allow Taiwan fisherman to install global positioning system (GPS)
equipment on their boats to let them ascertain their positions and
avoid unwittingly trespassing into Japan's exclusive economic zone.</P>
      <P>Hsieh called for the country to seek to resolve Taiwan's fishing
disputes with Japan resulting from the two countries' overlapping
exclusive economic zones in a legal and rational manner.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a lawyer-turned-politician, stressed that the Taiwan-Japan
fishing disputes should be sorted out through bilateral fishery talks
based on the principle of law.</P>
      <P>He discounted the idea expressed by some people of seeking
"justice" for Taiwan fishermen in an ideological manner, saying that
it is unhelpful to take a "stance" while ignoring the facts and
evidence in trying to resolve such international disputes.</P>
      <P>The premier instructed the COA and the CGA to offer financial
assistance to allow Taiwan fisherman to install GPS equipment on
their boats, saying that installing GPS equipment on Taiwan fishing
boats is the best way to avoid further confrontation in disputed
waters, such as the area of the East China Sea near the Tiaoyutai
Islands, which are claimed by Taiwan, Japan as well as China.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that South Korea has solved its fishing disputes with
Japan since equipping Korean fishing boats with GPS equipment.</P>
      <P>He urged local fishermen to avoid confrontation with Japanese
patrol boats by not crossing Taiwan's tentative line of demarcation
dividing the overlapping economic zones, saying that the fisherman
will receive the government's complete protection within this
boundary.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh said the government's resolve to protect local
fishermen's rights and interests and to ensure their safety is beyond
question, adding that the administration has continuously made
efforts in this regard and that there are concrete statistics
providing evidence of these efforts.</P>
      <P>Between 2000 and early 2005, Hsieh said, Taiwan law enforcement
forces expelled 22,318 mainland Chinese fishing boats from Taiwan's
economic zone, as well as 504 fishing boats from other countries, in
addition to detaining 4,297 Chinese fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies compiled by the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency,
Hsieh said that only 11 Taiwan fishing boats have been impounded by
Japanese coast guard patrol vessels since 2000, while 38 Chinese
fishing boats and 102 South Korean fishing ships have been impounded
by Japan during the same period.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR RATIONAL REVIEW OF FLOOD-CONTROL PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh on Wednesday called for
a rational review of the Cabinet's proposed eight-year, NT$80 billion
flood-control project and urged that the issue not be politicized.</P>
      <P>He noted that recent torrential rains have caused serious
flooding in some parts of central and southern Taiwan. During his
inspection tour of six cities and counties, Hsieh said, he was
impressed to see that some people expressed appreciation for those
who pitched in for flood-relief work, while some people who have
extracted excessive amounts of groundwater took others to task
without reflecting upon their own roles in the flooding.</P>
      <P>The premier said that it is the responsibility of the government
to deal with natural disasters, adding that the eight-year, NT$80
billion project was not made in haste or on impulse.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Ministry of Economic Affairs began to review
the nagging problem of flooding two years ago but was unable to work
out a substantial plan due to a lack of funds.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan first put forward the project in early
February, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh has called for an extraordinary legislative session so as
to review and pass the flood-control project quickly, although
opposition parties have reacted lukewarmly to the call.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FRUITS HOLD GOOD MARKET PROSPECTS IN EUROPE: BUSINESSMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin, June 21 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-li and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>High-quality Taiwan fruits hold good market
prospects in Europe, a Germany-based businessman from Taiwan said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The businessman, who only revealed his surname as Lan, said
Europe is a vast market and has an enormous demand for high-quality
farm produce, including fruit.</P>
      <P>Lan, who has operated mushroom farms in suburban Berlin for more
than 10 years, recently imported a variety of Taiwan fruits to test
the market. The fruits included pineapple, papaya, lichee, mango,
lemon and guava.</P>
      <P>"The deal is experimental in nature. I'll adjust the items to be
imported in the future and packaging in terms of market response, "
Lan said.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lan said, Taiwan fruit farmers interested in
exporting their produce to Europe should focus on exploring the
high-end market. Taiwan fruit traders can first target upmarket
restaurants and hotels as their chefs are more willing to buy
high-quality fruits at high prices, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lan himself has successfully sold various types of mushrooms in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands. His mushroom farm
is one of the largest in Europe.</P>
      <P>"So long as we can find reliable distribution channels and ensure
good product quality, Taiwan fruits have good market potential in
Europe," Lan said confidently.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lan said, there is still ample room for increases in
Taiwan's butterfly orchid exports to European countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking Republic of China official
said Tuesday in London that she is confident that various
Taiwan-grown flowers and fruits have a great chance of making inroads
into the British market.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yao-chi, executive director of the 921 Earthquake
Post-Disaster Recover Commission under the Executive Yuan, made the
remarks in an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Kuo, at the head of a delegation consisting of representatives
from the Council of Agriculture (COA) and an agricultural association
from Puli, a small town in Nantou County, which was hit hard by the
devastating magnitude 7.3 earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999, is currently
visiting the United Kingdom to promote flowers and fruits from
Taiwan's earthquake-affected areas.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that her commission's current job is to help local
industries in earthquake-affected areas to prosper, Kuo said that
flowers grown in Puli are very famous all over the world and that
Taiwan has gained a reputation of being a "fruit kingdom."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's high-quality flowers and fruits have their own
competitive edge, " Kao said, adding that the British importers she
met with at a dinner she hosted Tuesday night at the Macdonald Hotel
in London were impressed by the eight kinds of fruits and flowers she
introduced.</P>
      <P>A representative from a renowned local fruit company said after
tasting a lichee at the dinner party that it was the best lichee he
had ever tasted, promising that he would not only introduce the fruit
to British supermarkets, but would also make a visit to Taiwan in
October to better his understanding of Taiwan fruits.</P>
      <P>During her visit, Kuo has also visited local flower exhibitions
and flower markets to promote Taiwan flowers. Kuo said she is
encouraged by the positive response to the quality of flowers she has
introduced, saying that there is a lot of potential for growth in
Taiwan flower exports to the United Kingdom. Currently, Taiwan flower
exports to Great Britain stand at only US$200,00 per year, according
to COA statistics.</P>
      <P>Kuo is scheduled to leave for Manchester Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER WON'T FLINCH IN SAFEGUARDING ROC SOVEREIGNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Wednesday that he would "not flinch in the righteous pursuit of
safeguarding the Republic of China's sovereignty and fishermen's
rights and interests" even if he were not running for the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks at a meeting of the opposition KMT Central
Standing Committee in response to criticism that he was grandstanding
to boost his chances of winning the July 16 KMT chairmanship election
by traveling aboard a Knox-class frigate the previous day to the
disputed waters northeast of Taiwan where the economic zones of
Taiwan and Japan overlap and which have been the source of a recent
spate of fishery disputes.</P>
      <P>Wang, who doubles as a KMT vice chairman, said that if the
government is turning a blind eye or is not doing enough in declaring
the nation's sovereignty and protecting fishermen's operation rights,
"we will of course do so, " adding that "if the government is doing
so, but is not doing it in a satisfactory way, we will step up our
efforts on the matter."</P>
      <P>The disputed waters lie close to a group of uninhabited islets
known as the Tiaoyutai Islands in Taiwan and as the Senkakus in
Japan. The island group is claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan. The
Tiaoyutais lie 120 nautical miles to the northeast of Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>On whether he might at some point land on the Tiaoyutais, Wang
said that he won't "rule out the possibility" if the opportunity
arises.</P>
      <P>Wang said the previous day that from the historical, geographical
and legal perspectives, the Taioyutais are ROC territory.</P>
      <P>He noted Wednesday that before the inauguration of the Coast
Guard Administration (CGA) in 2000, the Ministry of National Defense
had been in charge of assisting the protection of local fishermen.</P>
      <P>However, he continued, the CGA has only about 200 vessels, and
only 13 of them are over 500 tons, which he said is not sufficient to
meet the needs of protecting Taiwan fisherman across the vast expanse
of Taiwan's waters.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that the CGA has only one vessel over 2,000
tons, which he said is "seriously inadequate." If the CGA proposes a
budget to build more vessels over 2,000 tons, the legislature will
support it, he added.</P>

of religion, which will be handed out to local Buddhist and Taoist

practice has also encouraged the commercial breeding and hunting of
wildlife.</P>
      <P>While the large-scale, commercialized purchase and release of
animals means disaster for the animals, which are unequipped to

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR URGES PRESIDENT TO DECLARE TIAOYUTAIS ROC TERRITORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou urged President
Chen Shui-bian Wednesday to declare the Tiaoyutai island group
Republic of China territory under the jurisdiction of Toucheng, in
northeastern Ilan County.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang,
made the remarks at a regular meeting of the KMT Central Standing
Committee.</P>
      <P>Ma agreed with a trip made by Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng, who along with 14 other legislators boarded a Knox-class
navy frigate the previous day to travel to disputed waters in the
East China Sea where the economic zones of Taiwan and Japan overlap
and which have been the source of a recent spate of fishery disputes.</P>
      <P>The disputed waters lie close to a group of uninhabited islets
known as the Tiaoyutai in Taiwan and as the Senkakus in Japan. The
island group, which lies 120 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan, is
claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that although reactions to Wang's trip were mixed, it
was "significant" for the government and the country's fishermen but
expressed hope that the stunt was not only a "flash in the pan."
</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) , the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) and the navy should cooperate, with the CGA deploying
on the frontline, with the navy and the MND right behind the CGA to
fully protect the fishermen, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government should refuse to recognize Japan's
demarcation of its economic zone from the Tiaoyutais, or it will be
tantamount to an acquiescence of Japan's sovereignty over the island
group.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Tiaoyutais are currently controlled by Japan, he
said this should not affect Taiwan's sovereignty over the island
group, claiming that the "occupation" does not conform with
international law and is illegal.</P>
      <P>He said that the Tiaoyutai issue involves history, geography,
international law and politics, and whether the issue can be put
forward in an international court is still questionable.</P>
      <P>He also said that the government should not only discuss fishery
rights with Japan but also sovereignty in upcoming talks and that if
Japan does not agree to discuss sovereignty, then the protection of
the fishermen should be conducted more aggressively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VOA REPORT ON MAC CHAIRMAN REMARKS REPUDIATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  22  (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
repudiated Wednesday a report by the Voice of America radio station
on the MAC chairman's remarks related to cross-Taiwan Strait
relations and the possible arrangement of a meeting between the
leaders of the two sides.</P>
      <P>The VOA reported Tuesday that MAC Chairman Joseph Wu has urged
China to help arrange a meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and
China's President Hu Jintao by showing more willingness. It also
quoted Wu as saying that Taipei and Beijing should use "the
interpretation on the results of the 1992 Hong Kong talks " to resume
dialogue between the two sides.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Wu also claimed that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party government does not exclude an eventual
unification with China, saying that it is wrong to be of the opinion
that the DPP's only option is Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Claiming in a press release that the report only picked out part
of Wu's remarks, the MAC said that what Wu actually said is that a
Chen-Hu meeting can be held when cross-strait tensions are eased.</P>
      <P>Wu also said it is impossible for Taiwan to accept the
arrangement of such a meeting if Beijing insists on maintaining its
"one China" policy, military intimidation and diplomatic obstruction
towards the nation, as well as demands that the country should accept
certain political preconditions.</P>
      <P>Under the current hostile relations between the two sides of the
strait, Wu said both sides could have better and closer cooperation
if their officials could hold talks on practical matters, including
direct charter flights and tourism and agricultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that in order to resolve cross-strait disputes, Chen
said in March that based on the results achieved in the 1992 Hong
Kong talks, he would agree on the resumption of talks with China, Wu
further said that if China wants to show willingness, it should take
Chen's words as a concept to rebuild a dialogue channel between the
Straits Exchange Foundation and the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait, the quasi-official bodies on either side of the
strait set up to handle exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>In response to a VOA question on how to eventually resolve the
problems related to Taiwan's future, Wu said it is wrong to think
that the only option of the DPP after it became the ruling party is
to separate Taiwan from China and cut all ties.</P>
      <P>Chen said in his second-term inaugural speech delivered in May 20
last year that he does not exclude the possibility of developing any
kind of relations with China in the future if the Taiwan people give
him the mandate to do so, Wu continued.</P>
      <P>"We don't want to pick an option and discuss it before a further
debate by the Taiwan people on all the options, or to close the
door, " he continued, saying that "the door of Taiwan's future is
open."</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICY OF ONE INCINERATOR PER CITY OR COUNTY TO BE REVIEWED: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh instructed Wednesday
that the policy of having one incinerator per city or county should
be reviewed in the hope that several cities or counties can share one
incinerator.</P>
      <P>Hsieh issued the instruction after listening to reports by the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) at an Executive Yuan
floor meeting.</P>
      <P>EPA officials reported that the campaign to reduce garbage volume
has borne fruit, greatly reducing daily transported garbage to a
little over 16,000 tons in 2004 from more than 24,000 tons in 1996,
representing a reduction in the amount of garbage produced per person
per day from 1.143 kg to 0.709 kg.</P>
      <P>The officials said that it is estimated that disposal fees will
be reduced by around NT$600 million (US$19.04 million) this year from
the previous year.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i made the suggestion that the policy of one
incinerator per city and county be reviewed and Hsieh said that due
to the good results of the garbage reduction campaign, some
incinerators under construction may not have enough garbage to
dispose of, making them redundant.</P>
      <P>The incinerator policy was implemented by the previous Kuomintang
government, the premier said.</P>
      <P>The premier also suggested the promotion of reducing pollution
emissions from vehicles and producing low energy consumption,
low-pollution vehicles to help improve air quality.</P>
      <P>In addition, the premier noted that at present there are still 12
cities and counties without sewage pipes, an issue that needs to be
addressed, as sewage pipes are a major gauge of a nation's
development.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is not afraid of negotiating
with China and will not rule out opening political talks with
Beijing, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Taiwan has shown goodwill to China on many
occasions and that President Chen Shui-bian has offered to reopen
cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue based on the foundation of the 1992
talks in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The minister made the remarks while giving a speech on the
cross-strait situation and the triangular U.S.-China-Taiwan relations
at the World Affairs Council of Northern California in San Francisco.</P>
      <P>Saying Taiwan's resolve to deepen its democratic development
remains unchanged, Chen noted that the constitutional reforms
accomplished recently in Taiwan are aimed at enhancing government
efficiency.</P>
      <P>The president has promised that the second phase of reforms will
not involve changes to the country's territorial boundaries or
official designation, he went on.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's status as an independent, sovereign state will
not change and that Taiwan will stick to its position to maintain the
cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>On the situation in China, Chen said the "peaceful rise" claimed
by Beijing has in fact posed a serious challenge to the world,
because China has emerged as a superpower in terms of economy,
military and nationalism but not democracy.</P>
      <P>He urged the international community not to make concessions to
China on cross-strait issues and called on Washington to promote
constructive U.S.-China-Taiwan relations.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed the hope
Wednesday that he can visit Saint Kitts and Nevis in early September.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while receiving St. Kitts and
Nevis Prime Minister Denzil Douglas at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Republic of China and St. Kitts and Nevis have
enjoyed diplomatic relations for 22 years and he expressed hope to
become the first ROC president to visit the Caribbean country.</P>
      <P>He noted that bilateral relations are close and that various
cooperation projects between the two countries are progressing
smoothly, including a wharf, a multiple-function cultural center and
the redevelopment of a "Warner Park" project.</P>
      <P>He expressed appreciation for the long-term support of St. Kitts
and Nevis for the ROC's bid to take part in international affairs.</P>
      <P>He also extended a welcome to a St. Kitts and Nevis plan to
establish an embassy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Douglas for his part said that China's adoption of its
Anti-secession Law in March, which codifies the use of force against
Taiwan should the island move toward formal independence, has thrown
uncertainty upon the peace of the Asia and Pacific region, but he
expressed belief that Taiwan should still be able to maintain
positive exchanges with the international community and that its
people will enjoy peace and stability.</P>
      <P>St. Kitts and Nevis will continue to support Taiwan
internationally, Douglas said, adding that the purpose of
establishing embassy in Taiwan is aimed at promoting bilateral
relations and learning from Taiwan's experience.</P>
      <P>Douglas also said that his country is undergoing a major
transformation, hoping to break from the sugar industry to the
service and information industries. As Taiwan underwent a similar
transformation, he expressed the hope that Taiwan will provide
guidance in this regard.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan is happy to help by engaging in personnel
training and technical exchange programs with St. Kitts and Nevis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI AIRPORT NOT ON TRACK FOR DIRECT LINKS DESPITE TOURIST OPENING</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a government plan to open Taiwan up
to Chinese tourists, Taipei's Sung Shan Airport is not suitable for
serving direct flights between Taiwan and China at present, a
government official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsin-teh, deputy director-general of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, made the remarks at a public hearing called by
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Ting Shou-chung at the
Legislative Yuan in which government officials, academicians and
industry executives got together to discuss ways to develop Taipei's
tourism.</P>
      <P>Responding to Ting's proposal that Sung Shan Airport be allowed
to service direct flights from Shanghai's Hongqiao International
Airport, Lin said that Chiang Kai-shek International Airport near
Taipei and Kaohsiung International Airport in southern Taiwan are
more suitable.</P>
      <P>Sung Shan Airport is not being considered by the government at
present, Lin said, adding however that the domestic airport could be
a study case after conditions for direct links across the Taiwan
Strait have become ripe.</P>
      <P>Appointing an airport for cross-strait direct flights will mainly
depend on the situation between Taiwan and China, he explained.</P>
      <P>Hsia Chu-jeou, a professor at National Taiwan University, said
that the government should open Taiwan to Chinese tourists as soon as
possible and should designate Sung Shan Airport to ply direct links
with Hongqiao Airport, to help inject economic momentum to both
Taipei and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Visitors Association Chairman Stanley Yen urged the
government to hold substantive talks with China to ward off a
possible negative impact of the opening.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the government must not pass the responsibility of
preventing the absconding en masse of some groups of Chinese tourists
to tourist agents, Yen said it is the government's responsibility to
negotiate with China on the issue and ask the Chinese side to take
measures to stop any re-occurrences.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Yen called for a standard practice in receiving
Chinese tourists, pointing out that there must be no differences in
treating visitors from China or elsewhere. This, he said, will help
Chinese visitors gain a better understanding of Taiwan and improve
Taiwan's international image.</P>
      <P>A representative from the Travel Quality Assurance Association
suggested that Taiwan hotels treat Chinese tourists fairly because
poor treatment will seriously taint Taiwan's image.</P>

      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng registered on behalf of party
Chairman James Soong Wednesday, the last day of registration for
aspirants for the PFP chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Soong, who claimed earlier that he has no intention of running,
had yet to announce whether he will run, but as no one else
registered, he is the only candidate in the race.</P>
      <P>Chin received urgent instructions from PFP Vice Chairman Chang
Chao-hsiung and presented the signatures of 92 PFP delegates
endorsing Soong to complete the registration process.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Soong is willing to continue at the helm of the
PFP, party sources said that "this is not a time to ask about his
willingness" and claimed that the post is "not about power" but about
a mission and responsibility.</P>
      <P>The sources also said that although the endorsement had not
received prior approval from Soong, he will take up the post with
the strong urging of his supporters.</P>
      <P>According to PFP regulations, the party will have an election and
the result will be announced July 22.</P>
      <P>Sources said that Soong "has not been in a good mood recently, "
which has affected his willingness to run for the chairmanship.
The PFP has seen several key members break ranks over the past two
months to rejoin the main opposition Kuomintang because they are
dissatisfied with Soong's meetings with President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lee Hung-chun, who said Soong is being plagued
constantly with the party's financial problems, said he is
considering asking the party's legislators and elected officials to
launch a donation drive for the cash-strapped party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>15TH TAIWAN-JAPAN FISHERY MEETING SCHEDULED FOR JULY 29 IN TOKYO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 15th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery
talks has been tentatively scheduled for July 29 in Tokyo, a Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The date and venue were proposed by Japanese authorities, the
official said, adding that Japan has also proposed that a preparatory
meeting be held in mid-July.</P>
      <P>According to the official, details regarding the preparatory
meeting and the formal round of talks are still in the works.</P>
      <P>"We'll make a formal announcement once all technical details are
fleshed out," he added.</P>
      <P>As to the level of the Japanese chief negotiator for the upcoming
talks, the official said, the ministry is still negotiating with
Japanese authorities on this matter. The highest-ranking Taiwan
official in previous talks was chief secretary of the Fishery
Administration under the Council of Agriculture, while the Japanese
delegate was an official from its fishery agency.</P>
      <P>For the upcoming round of talks, the official said, the Fishery
Administration will continue to play the leading role, with MOFA
acting as a conduit to help set the stage for negotiators from the
two sides.</P>
      <P>The official said MOFA has adopted a "double-track" formula for
consultations with Japan in arranging the forthcoming fishery talks.</P>
      <P>One track is the nation's representative office in Tokyo, which
is responsible for consulting with Japanese authorities and the other
is MOFA itself which is responsible for discussing with the Taipei
office of the Japanese Interchange Association (JIA) . JIA is a
quasi-official body authorized to handle relations with Taiwan in the
absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The official further said MOFA has informed the Cabinet and
national security units of the latest progress in preparing for the
upcoming fishery talks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said the most urgent task now is to forge
a national consensus on the basic stance for settling fishing rights
disputes with Japan.</P>
      <P>At the heart of the dispute is the two countries' sovereignty
claim to the Tiaoyutai Islands -- a group of uninhabited islets in
the East China Sea located some 120 nautical miles northeast of
Taiwan proper. The island group is claimed by Taiwan, China and
Japan. The previous 14 rounds of Taiwan-Japanese fishery talks did
not make significant headway because Taiwan would not forsake its
sovereignty claim to the Tiaoyutais which Japan has held since 1972.</P>
      <P>Both Tokyo and Taipei claim that the island group fall within
their exclusive economic zones. Japan often fines ship owners and
impounds Taiwanese fishing vessels that enter waters close to the
Tiaoyutais.</P>
      <P>The dispute came into the limelight again recently after some 50
Taiwan fishing boats staged a rare protest in the disputed waters
over Japanese coast guard ships' frequently chasing them away from
the region. Under strong pressure from opposition lawmakers, the
military sent a Knox-class frigate to patrol the disputed waters
Tuesday to accentuate the government's determination to protect
fishermen's rights and safety.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official said the ministry will call an interministerial
meeting around July 5 to discuss strategies for the new round of
talks.</P>
      <P>In addition, the official said MOFA plans to invite legislators,
scholars and legal experts to a seminar to obtain their opinions
about the issue.</P>
      <P>MOFA also plans to arrange a meeting between relevant government
officials and fishermen or fishing industry representatives, the
official said.</P>
      <P>"We hope to pool our wisdom through extensive discussions with
all parties or groups concerned about the issue," the official said.</P>
      <P>At the moment, the official said local people are divided over
the sovereignty claim to the Tiaoyutais. While some people advocate
no compromise on the sovereignty claim, others propose shelving the
sovereignty dispute and instead focusing on settling the fishing
rights dispute with Japan.</P>
      <P>"By holding an interministerial coordination meeting, we hope to
seek a national consensus on the bottom line for talks with Japan and
a viable package for settling the fishing rights dispute, " the
official said.</P>
      <P>He said both Taiwan and Japan should exercise flexibility in
dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, he said, the sovereignty issue should be shelved for the
time being and the priority should be given to fishing rights.</P>
      <P>"We hope both sides can reach a consensus on jointly exploring
and managing fishery resources in the disputed waters. By so doing,
fishermen from both countries will no longer over-fish in the region
and a mutually acceptable management mechanism can be established, "
the official said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With temporary staffing becoming a trend
among local businesses to cut personnel costs, 83 percent of office
workers will accept an offer of temporary employment, according to
the results of a survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the online employment service
provider 1111 Job Bank on 1,326 office workers and 570 business
owners June 9-21. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.6 percent.</P>
      <P>While 96.72 percent of the respondents have "heard of temporary
staffing, " 42.92 percent said they lack a full understanding of what
it is all about, and 78.48 percent have never had any experience in
taking temporary employment.</P>
      <P>On the reasons that they would accept temporary employment, 63.98
percent of the respondents said because this would help enrich their
work experience; 52.87 percent said because jobs are hard to find;
48.42 percent said because the working hours are flexible; 47.95
percent said because they can do the job part-time and make extra
income; and 21.05 percent said because temporary employment enables
them to take care of their families.</P>
      <P>The main considerations that the respondents have in taking a
temporary job include the pay (61.4 percent); benefits (39.65
percent); the opportunity to gain more work experience (37.31
percent); working hours (27.37 percent); and whether they will enjoy
a five-day work week (24.21 percent).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 28.77 percent of the business owners surveyed said
they have hired workers through a temporary staffing agency.</P>
      <P>While 74.39 percent of these respondents said they have done so
to cope with business demand, 29.27 percent said they want to save
personnel costs, and 25.61 percent said they wish to reduce
administrative chores.</P>
      <P>These business respondents hired an average of 8.43 temporary
workers, which account for 7.92 percent of their permanent staff,
with the duration of employment averaging 5.55 months.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is not planning to relocate
citizens from several townships affected by recent severe flooding in
central and southern Taiwan, Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Jung-tai
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference following the weekly Cabinet
meeting presided over by Premier Frank Hsieh, Cho said that neither
the Executive Yuan, nor any ministry or individual, has any such
plan.</P>
      <P>Cho quoted Hsieh as saying that any thought of relocating people
is not an issue that can be taken rashly as the opinions of all
concerned would have to be taken into consideration first.</P>
      <P>According to Cho, the premier asked during the meeting whether
the Ministry of Economic Affairs or any individual had put forward
such a plan and he claimed that even plans under assessment do not
necessarily mean that they would become government policy and be
carried out.</P>
      <P>The premier reiterated that relevant government agencies will
give aid to the people affected by the floods as quickly as possible
and help them get back to their normal lives, Cho said.</P>
      <P>After heavy torrential downpours inundated central and southern
Taiwan a week ago, the economics ministry has done its utmost to
repair power and water facilities, while the Council of Agriculture
has been dedicated to maintaining the prices of fruits and
vegetables, he said, adding that the government will periodically
explain to the public its pace in conducting relief operations.</P>
      <P>Various townships in central Yunlin and southern Chiayi counties
-- Taiwan's major source of farm and aquatic produce - were hardest
hit by the weeklong flooding.</P>
      <P>Experts have pointed out that the damage is mainly a result of
serious land sinkage due to local farmers' and fish growers' heavy
use of groundwater over the long term.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Eden Social Welfare Foundation launched
an aid program Wednesday to help disadvantaged families with foreign
spouses keep their children in the country.</P>
      <P>An Eden spokesman said the ultimate goal of the program is to
prevent low-income families with foreign wives from sending their
young children abroad due to financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, many young kids born to Taiwanese
fathers and Vietnamese mothers are now living in Vietnam with their
maternal grandparents because their parents have had a hard time
earning a living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Eden spokesman said the charity has recently interviewed 81
families with Vietnamese wives to explore their views on sending
their children to Vietnam for financial reasons.</P>
      <P>"We found that 70 percent said they would rather not have to send
them and would prefer to have their young children live with them in
Taiwan, " the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Under Eden's aid program, the charity will offer NT$8,000 in
subsidies to each poor family with a foreign spouse every month to
help finance living expenses and educational and medical spending.</P>
      <P>According to the Eden spokesman, a 25-year-old Vietnamese woman
who sent her young daughter to Vietnam a year ago because she has to
work to help with the family finances, will soon be able to welcome
back her daughter with financial aid from Eden.</P>
      <P>The results of a recent Eden survey showed that 60 percent of
families with foreign spouses live on a monthly income of less than
NT$30,000 and about 20,000 children born to those families cannot
attend kindergartens due to financial problems.</P>
      <P>Local people are welcome to donate funds for Eden's new aid
program, the spokesman said. Donors are encouraged to call (02)

    <TEXT>New York Times: Former Klansman Guilty of
Manslaughter in 1964

A jury at Philadelphia, Miss., pronounced the 80-year-old Edgard
Ray Ray Killena, a former member of the the Ku Klux Klan, guilty of
manslaughter on Tuesday in the deaths of three young and idealistic
civil rights workers who disappeared on a summer night here exactly
41 years ago.

The disappearance of the three men, Andrew Goodman, 20, Michael
Schwerner, 24, and James Earl Chaney, 21, on June 21, 1964, drew the
national news media and hundreds of searchers to Neshoba County,
while Mississippi officials said publicly that the disappearance was
a hoax intended to draw attention.

The case, dramatized in the movie "Mississippi Burning, " is one
of the biggest in what some have called the South's "atonement
trials" revisiting civil-rights-era atrocities.

Wall Street Journal: As Economy Shifts, A New Generation Fights
to Keep Up

The gap between poor and rich in the U.S. has widened over the
past 30 years. The divergent fates of workers in Milwaukee illustrate
why it can be so hard to move up.

In 1957, Wayne Hall started to work at the age of 24. Over the
years, he rose from machinery operator to machinery inspector to
chief inspector and at age 72, he is retired and can afford to travel
with his wife to Disneyland and Tahiti.

In 1971, Hall's stepson, Larson, went to work as a welder in the
fabrication shop of a factory across the street from Badger that made
rock crushers and other heavy equipment.

By 1981, he was earning roughly as much as his stepfather. But he
was lai d off that year. Larson has held many jobs since -- tour-boat
operator, trucker, air- conditioning repairman.

Except for one year, he has yet to earn as much as he did at the
welding job. Today, he works as a computer support technician, but
the contract job runs just six weeks and he doesn't know if he'll
still be working after that.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>INVESTMENT WILLINGNESS UNAFFECTED BY POLLUTION RULES: MINISTER HO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As long as Taiwan clearly defines its rules
regarding pollution controls, specifically regarding greenhouse gas
emissions, the willingness to invest in Taiwan will not be
diminished, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan's emissions of greenhouse gases are not
expected to increase too fast given that energy-consuming industries
are already saturated at home, Ho said that it would be more damaging
if the country fails to meet its target in cutting greenhouse gas
emissions.</P>
      <P>Citing a study by National Cheng Kung University Professor Chen
Chia-jung, Ho said that many of the world's major developed countries
have not met their reduction targets; rather, they have in turn
showed growth in their emission levels. Germany is the only country
that has succeeded in cutting its emissions, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>Ho said that it is better to leave room for future discussions at
a time when national interests also must be heeded in view of the
global efforts to cut pollution, namely the Kyoto Protocol that took
effective early this year.</P>
      <P>The government will ask investors to put forward their greenhouse
gas reduction estimates in both the short and long term when applying
for government approval for their new projects and it also will
carefully examine the emission levels by old plants, she said,
arguing that investment willingness will not be hindered as long as
the government sets the rules clearly.</P>
      <P>Attendees, including the economics minister and scores of
experts, fell short of setting a new reduction target in the
country's overall emissions of carbon dioxide at the two-day national
energy conference that ended Tuesday.</P>
      <P>They also acknowledged that Taiwan will not be able to reach the
reduction target set in the 1998 national energy meeting that
requires the country's greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 to be
lowered to the level registered in 2000.</P>
      <P>It also was decided in the meeting that construction of the
Fourth Nuclear Power Plant will continue and that nuclear power will
be slashed to only 7 percent of Taiwan's energy needs by 2020.</P>
      <P>Many environmentalists are disappointed with the outcome of the
conference, complaining that the government has broken its promise of

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday the
government has never wavered on its sovereignty claim over the
Tiaoyutai Islands, a group of uninhabited islets in the East China
Sea some 120 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>"Our stance that the Tiaoyutais belong to the Republic of China
has never changed," Chen was quoted as having said during an informal
meeting with mayors and magistrates of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais , which have been held by Japan since 1971, are also
claimed by China and Japan. As the 200-mile exclusive economic zones
of Taiwan and Japan overlap in waters close to the Tiaoyutais, and
bilateral fishing disputes have occurred in the region from time to
time.</P>
      <P>Chen said the recent dispute with Japan is about fishing rights
rather than sovereignty. He further said the Taiwan-Japan dispute
over their overlapping economic waters should be resolved through
negotiations.</P>
      <P>As the top national leader, Chen said he is obligated to defend
national dignity, sovereignty, security as well as fishermen's rights
and interests.</P>
      <P>Noting that a new round of fishery talks between Taiwan and Japan
will be held late next month in Tokyo, Chen said all relevant
government agencies should make preparations well in advance.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, National Security Council
Secretary-General Chiou Yi-jen said the administrative branch should
strengthen communications with legislators and fishermen over the
fishing problems in the disputed waters.</P>
      <P>"Some local fishermen feel that the government has not done
enough to protect their rights to operate in waters close to the
Tiaoyutais which they regard as their traditional fishing grounds.
Until 1945, Taiwan was under Japanese colonial rule. Therefore,
fishermen could freely operate in waters surrounding the Tiaoyutais.
Nowadays, the situation has changed. We must help fishermen adjust
their notions. The government will definitely do its utmost to
negotiate with Japan. Hopefully, fishermen from both sides should be
allowed to operate in the overlapping economic waters," Chiou said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Wednesday it "highly approves" of a statement issued by the Swedish
parliament earlier this month that expresses opposition to the
European Union's plan to lift its 16-year-old ban on arms sales to

      <P>The Swedish parliament passed the statement June 16 by a vote of
198-102.</P>
      <P>The statement said the parliament opposes any proposal to lift
the arms embargo against China now because China's human rights
conditions have not improved and it worries about the threat to
Asia-Pacific regional security.</P>
      <P>It further said that if the arms ban were to be lifted now, it
would be the worst possible timing given that China's enactment of
its Anti-Secession Law in March has heightened worries about

      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Farmers Association
is not authorized by the government to negotiate with China, and its
leaders will have to face legal consequences if they negotiate with
the Beijing regime on anything which falls within the government's
purview, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) officials warned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued Wednesday night, MAC officials said the
Executive Yuan has asked the MAC and the Council of Agriculture to
form a team with the aid of the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council to talk with Beijing on the sale of Taiwan fruits to the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The farmers' association may exchange views with Chinese
officials, but is not allowed to enter into any agreement, the MAC
statement said.</P>
      <P>The statement was prompted by a wire service report that Liu
Chuan-chung, president of the Taiwan Provincial Farmers Association
was in Beijing at the head of a delegation Wednesday to talk with
Beijing officials on the export of Taiwan's fruits to China.</P>
      <P>The MAC statement said the Council of Agriculture cautioned the

Association for Economic and Trade Exchange Across the Taiwan Strait
(AETEATS) and the Taiwan Provincial Farmers Association (TPFA) met to
exchange views on technical issues pertaining to Taiwan's fruit
exports to China on a duty-free basis.</P>
      <P>Noting that the agricultural sectors on each side of the Taiwan
Strait are complementary, AETEATS officials said the
association will spare no efforts to cooperate with the TPFA to

illness in Canton at the age of 81.

1952: The four characters "Wu Wang Tsai Chu," an ancient saying

transferred diplomatic recognition to Beijing.

2001: The Navy General Headquarters says that it has commissioned

a lawyer to protect its legitimate rights in a kickback scandal
involving its purchase of six French-made Lafayette-class frigates 10
years ago

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A man who withdraws himself from
the world for no other reason than to show his personal purity of
motive is one who breaks up one of the greatest ties in the
foundation of society. A good and wise man, on the other hand, who
enters the public service, tries to carry out what he thinks to be
right. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is
well aware of that."</TEXT>

      <P>Outgoing Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor
Corp.(TTLC) Chairman Hwang Ing-san will take over the helm of the
Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower), Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
confirmed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hwang, 64, who holds a doctoral degree in business management
from National Chengchi University, assumed the TTLC chairmanship in
October 2002.</P>
      <P>Ho said that a lot of factors are taken into consideration in
choosing the chairman of a state-owned enterprise, adding that Hwang
was chosen by the Executive Yuan over other candidates because of his
superb management skills and his affable personality.</P>
      <P>Ho said that it is hoped that Hwang will make good use of his
skills to step up communications with the public on such issues as
energy prices, nuclear waste disposal and nuclear safety.</P>
      <P>"The personnel arrangement is expected to have a positive effect
on Taipower," Ho added.</P>
      <P>Ho noted that Taipower is a highly professional company. In the
past, except for Lin Neng-pai, who stepped down last month after
serving in the post for just 10 months, most of the chairmen
came from engineering backgrounds.</P>
      <P>Ho said that Hwang faces a daunting task, pointing out that all
the issues that he will have to deal with, such as the thorny nuclear
disposal and security issues, will require good communication skills
on his part.</P>
      <P>Taipower President Edward K. M. Chen will be in charge of the
professional aspects of running the company, while Hwang will be in
charge of the communication aspects, Ho said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI-WASHINGTON MUTUAL CONFIDENCE RECOVERING: TAIWAN OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mutual confidence between Taiwan and
the United States has been recovering owing to the assuring policies
adopted by Taiwan over the past months, ROC Representative to the
United States David Ta-wei Lee said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the differences and misunderstandings between the
leaders of the two countries are also diminishing and that
Taipei-Washington relations are now stable.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in a press conference for Chinese-language
media in Washington, D.C. in response to a question about whether he
feels that the United States has leaned toward Taiwan in terms of its
cross-Taiwan Strait policy since the start of U.S. President George
W. Bush's second term.</P>
      <P>The ROC representative said he can sense that communication
between the two countries has been getting smoother and smoother over
the past 11 months of his term. The two sides have been able to
exchange views immediately and candidly on almost all important
issues, he said, adding that they are both willing to meet each other
halfway to reach consensus on issues over which they have
differences.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that during a June 8 television interview,
President Bush reaffirmed Washington's commitment to defend Taiwan
according to the Taiwan Relations Act in the event of China invading
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a recent phone conversation with Chinese President Hu Jintao,
Bush also urged Hu to hold dialogue with the duly-elected leader in
Taiwan, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Beijing's behavior over the past several
months, including its enactment of the Anti-Secession Law targeting
Taiwan, has prompted Washington to adjust its cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>Asked whether this improvement in Taiwan-U.S. ties will be
reflected in the arrangements for President Chen Shui-bian's planned
transit stop in the United States en route to Central America in
September, Lee said the results of the improvement in substantive
bilateral relations can be seen in many aspects.</P>
      <P>The president's transit stop arrangements are only one aspect,
Lee continued, adding that the results may not necessarily be
reflected in his stopover arrangements as this is only a superficial
aspect and not as important as the substantive improvements in
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>On issues concerning the Korean Peninsula, Lee confirmed that
Taiwan has actively participated and cooperated in the United States'
efforts against nuclear weapons development and organized crime in
North Korea. He said that the Taiwan-U.S. cooperation has continued
for quite some time and that Washington is very grateful for Taiwan's
assistance in the matter.</P>

Chinese Oil Giant in Takeover Bid for U.S.
Corporation

The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) is bidding to
buy the American energy giant Unocal. It demonstrates the increasing
influence on Asia of Wall Street's bare-knuckled takeover tactics.
CNOOC's bid, which comes two months after Unocal agreed to be sold to
Chevron, the American energy giant, for US$16.4 billion, is expected
to incite a potentially costly bidding war over the California-based
Unocal, a large independent oil company. CNOOC said its offer
represents a premium of about US$1.5 billion over the value of
Unocal's deal with Chevron after a US$500 million breakup fee.

Center for Disease Control, none of the 37 family members, neighbors
and healthcare workers who have had contact with the patient has come
down with similar symptoms.</P>

cholera, exists commonly in the environment and is transmissible
through the feces of an infected person, contaminated food or drink,
flies and cockroaches.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT STANDS BY TPFA ON TAIWAN FARM EXPORTS TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Farmers Association
(TPFA) has been helping local farmers sell their produce to China for
years, and has never infringed on the government's power or violated
Taiwan's laws, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman Chang
Jung-kung said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the government has over the past few years been
unable to help Taiwan farmers deal with their overproduction, Chang
said that it comes as a boon to them that China is willing to open
its door wider to fruits and agricultural imports from Taiwan
following a visit by KMT Chairman Lien Chan to China from April 26 to
May 3.</P>
      <P>Based on an existing foundation, the TPFA now is doing its best
to help Taiwan farmers sell their produce to China, Chang said,
adding that he sees no reason why the government would want to block
their efforts instead of giving them a helping hand.</P>
      <P>The KMT official's comments came after the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said the previous night that the TPFA has not
been authorized by the government to negotiate with China on farm
exports and that it will face legal punishment -- up to NT$2 million
(US$64,100) in fines or five years in jail -- if it's members engage
in talks that involve government authority with China.</P>
      <P>A TPFA delegation led by its president, Liu Chuan-chung, is
currently holding technical talks in Beijing with representatives of
the Association for Economic and Trade Exchange Across the Taiwan
Strait about China's promise to provide duty-free treatment to 15
categories of Taiwan fruits and to allow the import of 18 categories
of quarantined farm products, which was made to Lien during his
visit.</P>
      <P>Chang defended the TPFA's efforts in seeking benefits for Taiwan
farmers and accused the government of threatening the group in full
disregard of local farmers' interests.</P>
      <P>The TPFA is only trying to help Taiwan farmers seize a larger
share of the Chinese market as it did in the past and there is
nothing wrong with that, Chang argued, asking whether the government
is actually attempting to limit Taiwan farm exports to China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SEARCH AND RESCUE VOLUNTEERS TO OBSERVE MAINLAND EXERCISE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's world-famous search and rescue
volunteers group, known as International Headquarters SAR Taiwan
(IHSART) , will be represented when China stages a joint nautical
rescue exercise off Shanghai on July 7, the leader of the group said
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lu Cheng-tsung, commander of the group, confirmed in an interview
with the Central News Agency that his organization has received an
invitation from the Chinese Ministry of Communications to send
representatives to observe the exercise.</P>
      <P>While saying initially that he wished to maintain a low profile
for fear that too much media attention might turn IHSART's presence
at the exercise into a political issue, Lu eventually acknowledged
that his organization will send a number of representatives to the
exercise, including some from Taiwan and a few IHSART members who are
employed by Taiwan businessmen in the mainland.</P>
      <P>However, he added that nothing has been finalized yet, as he is
still considering who should go and under what name.</P>
      <P>Lu pointed out that the channels of communication are open
between IHSART and relevant mainland organizations, and that IHSART
representatives have observed similar mainland operations before. He
said that as far as participation in international search and rescue
missions is concerned, IHSART has already won worldwide recognition
for Taiwan and has not felt any pressure from China to block it from
the international arena.</P>
      <P>The 70-minute exercise near Shanghai's Yangsan International
Port, is said to be the largest of its kind by China, involving 30
vessels, five planes and thousands of people from 24 different units.
In addition to Taiwan, the United States, Japan and Russia have also
been invited to send observers.</P>
      <P>News reports from China said the exercise will be conducted on
the pretense that a large cargo ship has collided with a ship
carrying dangerous goods in East China Sea, resulting in both ships
leaking fuel, with the threat that the dangerous goods could explode.
Rescue workers will not only search for sailors who have jumped into
the sea but will also try to put out the fires on both ships and
clean up the oil spills.</P>

      <P>Taiwan lagged neighboring countries in
racking up trade surplus in the first five months of 2005, an
indication that there will be no much room for the local currency to
further appreciate, according to the newest tallies compiled by the
Central Bank of China (CBC).</P>
      <P>Statistics made public Wednesday by the CBC show that Taiwan only
had a total of US$549 million in trade surplus for the first five
months of this year, well behind China, Japan, Singapore and South
Korea.</P>
      <P>Japan enjoyed a trade surplus of nearly US$34.6 billion in the
January to May period, while China followed with about US$30 billion.
South Korea and Singapore had US$10.3 billion and US$6.08 billion,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's weaker performance in foreign trade means that the
country's supply of U. S. dollars is tight, leaving little room for

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) on
Thursday expressed the hope that the Legislative Yuan will pass a
revised draft Public Officials Election and Recall Law in its next
session to deal with bribery offenses more harshly.</P>
      <P>The CEC made the call following instructions by President Chen
Shui-bian to step up cracking down on bribery in the year-end,
three-in-one elections -- meaning city and county chief, city and
county councilors, and township and village heads elections.</P>
      <P>CEC spokesman Teng Tien-you said that complementary measures for
the Dec. 3 elections scheduled are in progress, and graft-fighting is
one of the focuses.</P>
      <P>Teng noted that the legislature passed the initial review of the
revised draft law at the end of May before the close of the first
legislative session, and the CEC hopes it can clear the legislature
in the next session, which is scheduled to open in September.</P>
      <P>Under the revised draft bill, bribery perpetrators will be
subject to prison terms between three and 10 years, and will be fined
between NT$1 million (US$31,746) and NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>For such major elections as the legislative speaker and vice
speaker, municipality heads, city and county speaker and vice speaker

    <HEADLINE>'EVERY POSSIBLE STRATEGY' TO BE USED TO RESOLVE FISHING DISPUTE: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined
Thursday to confirm news reports that Taiwan authorities will delink
the sovereignty issue from the fishing rights issue in the
forthcoming 15th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks aimed at sorting
out fishing disputes as a result of overlapping economic zones.</P>
      <P>Ministry spokesman Michel Lu said that Taiwan negotiators will be
allowed to use "every possible strategy" to win the greatest possible
benefits for Taiwan and its fishermen in the 15th round of
Taiwan-Japan fishery talks, scheduled for July 29 in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that both sides will exercise pragmatism and
flexibility to solve the disputes caused by the overlapping economic
zones since 1996 when the international law of 200-nautical mile
exclusive economic zones took effect, Lu noted.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the date and venue were proposed by Japanese
authorities, and Japan has also proposed that a preparatory meeting
be held in mid-July.</P>
      <P>Before July 29, Lu said, the foreign ministry will actively
integrate opinions from the government, the academic and the legal
sectors, as well as the fishing sector to forge a national consensus
on the basic stance of Taiwan for settling fishing rights disputes
with Japan.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials and relevant representatives will also meet
legislators from across the political spectrum in the near future to
make the prospective national consensus better representative, Lu
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu said, Japan's release of the skipper of another
Taiwanese fishing boat, the "Tsaiyiyu No. 1," Thursday represented a
goodwill gesture toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For the upcoming round of talks, Lu said, the Fishery
Administration will continue to play the leading role, with the
foreign ministry acting as a conduit to help set the stage for
negotiators from the two sides.</P>
      <P>Although there had been a tacit demarcation line, located near
the Tiaoyutai Islands -- a group of uninhabited islets in the East
China Sea located some 120 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan proper,
to which fishermen from both Taiwan and Japan are supposed to observe
-- Taiwanese fishing boats have often been chased away by Japanese
patrol boats even from the area only about 30 to 50 nautical miles
away from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Fishermen's Association of Suao,
northeastern Taiwan, Taiwan fishermen can no longer tolerate the
situation with Taiwanese fishing boats now being nabbed even at
Taiwan's door.</P>
      <P>The only way to escape this kind of Japanese bulling is to flee
as soon as the fishermen spot a Japanese patrol boat, from the
Taiwanese fishermen's traditional fishing grounds, said the officials
from the Suao Fishermen's Association.</P>
      <P>The dispute came into the limelight again in early June after
some 50 Taiwan fishing boats staged a rare protest in the disputed
waters over Japanese coast guard ships' frequently chasing them away
from the region.</P>
      <P>Under strong pressure from opposition lawmakers, the military
sent a Knox-class frigate to patrol the disputed waters June 21 to
accentuate the government's determination to protect fishermen's
rights and safety.</P>

      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue should
be conducted using a government-to-government model without any
conditions, ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said in an
interview with a U.S. newspaper.</P>
      <P>In the interview published Wednesday in the San Jose Mercury

unification with China as a condition for cross-strait talks to
resume.</P>
      <P>Chen said the recent China visit by two of Taiwan's opposition
leaders could have been an "icebreaker" in relations between the
governments on the two sides of the Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen ruled out the opening of direct cross-strait transportation
links for now for security reasons, although he said the government
continues to welcome investment by Taiwanese businessmen in China.</P>
      <P>However, Chen warned that China could use the economic ties to
apply political pressure on Taiwan if the island depends too much on
the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen expressed confidence in the relations between
Taipei and Washington despite the delay of the US$18 billion arms
procurement plan from the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Cabinet is asking the Legislative Yuan to hold a

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) urged the
Ministry of the Interior to thoroughly review its immigration policy
Thursday after several cases came to light in which foreign brides
abused their local family members.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yueh-chin, director of the TSU's women's affairs
department, accompanied by several TSU officials and representatives
of a local association dedicated to the promotion of women's welfare,
made the appeal in a news conference.</P>
      <P>Chiang expressed her discontentment with remarks by Vice Minister
of the Interior Chang Wen-ying who said a recent case in which a
foreign spouse abused her mother-in-law was an isolated case.</P>
      <P>Chang's claim is an excuse for the ministry's inability to manage
the country's immigration policy, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Arguing that this was not a unique situation as there are some
600 cases of physical abuse against family members by foreign spouses
around Taiwan, Chiang urged the Ministry of the Interior to hold a
census of all Taiwanese families with foreign spouses to better
understand the real situation of their marriages as the ministry has
allocated NT$3 billion (US$95 million) for the care and consulting
services for these foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>According to statistics, there are more than 300,000 foreign
spouses living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsao Chia-li, who is in charge of the TSU's propaganda arm, noted
that her party maintains that legal immigrants should be thoroughly
protected, while false marriages and human trafficking should be
stopped.</P>
      <P>The government's immigration policy should strike a balance among
social security, national security and human rights protection, Tsao
added.</P>
      <P>Liu Ting-mei, executive of a women's welfare association, said
both foreign spouses' abuse against their family members or they
themselves being abused are not isolated cases. She urged all victims
to lodge complaints to the TSU or women's associations for help.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AGRICULTURE COUNCIL PUSHES FOR REGULATIONS ON ANIMAL RELEASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) has worked out regulations on the practice of freeing animals
for religious purposes that should help conserve Taiwan's ecological
system.</P>
      <P>After numerous public opinion polls, four public hearings and a
final public consensus meeting on the animal release issue, the COA
has integrated all the opinions from academic researchers, wildlife
conservationists and the religion sector to craft the regulations,
paving the way for the country to have a law on the issue.</P>
      <P>The COA regulations suggest that correct ways of releasing
animals into the wild should be written into textbooks for
elementary and junior high schools and that customs authorities step
up their crackdown on smuggling of illegal animals from abroad.</P>
      <P>The COA regulations also suggest that the Ministry of the
Interior coordinate with members of religious circles to work out
their own regulations on religious freeing of animals based on the
COA version of release.</P>
      <P>An estimated more-than 200 million animals are released in
religious ceremonies in Taiwan annually, which experts say could be a
contributing factor leading to a biological disaster on the island.</P>
      <P>Local animal research groups, biological education bodies,
wildlife conservationists and scientists have called for the
government, particularly the COA, to hammer out measures to stem the
practice of releasing animals, which is unregulated.</P>
      <P>Chu Tseng-hung, chairman of the Environment and Animal Society of
Taiwan, said that the buying of captive animals and setting them free
by followers of some of Taiwan's religious organizations has become a
systematic, commercialized and mass activity of animal cruelty.</P>
      <P>Numerous animals -- monkeys, snakes, birds, fish, frogs, turtles
and even clams and lobsters -- are dumped in the country's rivers,
woods, lakes and even parks and golf courses, Chu said.</P>
      <P>Lucia Liu Severinghaus, a researcher with Academia Sinica's
Institute of Zoology, said that despite their goodwill, the people
who buy and release animals are doing them a grave disservice, as
most of the captive-bred animals, unable to survive in the wild,
simply die slowly of starvation or predation.</P>
      <P>Severinghaus said that the religious freeing of animals also
leads to alien invasions of non-native species, which breaks the food
chain, leads to hybridism and causes irreversible alteration of the
genetic makeup of biological communities.</P>
      <P>If the practice continues to be unregulated, she said, invasions
of harmful animals, like fire ants and golden apple snails, will
continue to occur in Taiwan, undermining the normal development and
evolution of the island's ecology and economy.</P>

      <P>The price of Taiwan bicycles has risen to
an average of NT$6,709 (US$213) per unit in the first quarter of this
year, statistics released by the Directorate General of the Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) showed Thursday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials also reported bicycle sales of NT$10.1 billion
during the first three months of this year.</P>
      <P>They noted that Taiwan has developed its bicycle industry for
more than 30 years and enjoys a good reputation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan produced on average 7.28 million bicycles every year in
the 1980s, reaching its zenith at 10.74 million bicycles in 1987. The
number started to decline after cheap price competition from China
and Vietnam as well as the exodus of manufacturers. The production
averaged around eight million units in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>Affected by the global recession around 2000 and the 911
terrorist attacks on the United States, Taiwan's largest bicycle
importer, the production has continued to drop and only slightly
rebounded last year to reach 4.95 million units, although the number
still represents a decrease of nearly 40 percent from the 1990s.</P>
      <P>With bicycle manufacturers focusing on research and development,
and name-brand promotion on high value-added products in recent years
to distance themselves from the cheap products in the mainland, the
average price per unit has gradually risen, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that the price of a Taiwan bicycle averaged NT$2,257 in
the 1980s, rising to NT$5,815 with a sale of NT$30.2 billion last

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) voiced
Thursday its opposition to a proposal to stop holding the elections
for township chiefs, calling it a scheme by the ruling party to wipe
out democracy among the rank and file.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said that his party is also
certainly opposed to the idea that township chiefs be appointed by
the central government, because township chiefs are the
"representation of Taiwan's grassroots democracy" and also because
the KMT enjoys strong support at that level.</P>
      <P>Chang called the central government's plan to stop holding the
township chief elections an attempt to counter public opinion and
suppress democracy at the grassroots level.</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks came after President Chen Shui-bian said a day
earlier during a gathering with city mayors and county chiefs of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that the issue could be put
to a referendum late this year for the public to decide.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Chen Chieh suggested that the
township chief elections be kept in place, but he opined that
elections for city mayors and county chiefs should be eliminated.</P>
      <P>If the city mayors and county chiefs were removed, the central
government would be able to delegate its power and resources directly
and effectively to township chiefs who have closer contacts with the
local people, Chen Chieh said, insisting that township chiefs must be
produced through elections to avoid bureaucracy and to better take
care of the people.</P>
      <P>As Premier Frank Hsieh has said more than once that the central
government is planning to hold elections for city mayors and county
magistrates and those for city and county councilors and township
chiefs together in December, Chen Chieh urged the DPP not to further
complicate the matter by adding another referendum if it really hopes
to reduce government spending.</P>
      <P>He also called on the DPP not to use the issue as a topic to
campaign for itself ahead of the year-end city mayor and county
magistrate elections.</P>

      <P>Police said that Shouichi Fujiwara, 45, is a chapter head of the
Yamaguchi Gumi, Japan's largest organized crime group, who took his
Taiwanese wife to Taiwan Jan. 22.</P>
      <P>But police were tipped off by their Japanese counterparts that
Fujiwara was involved in a hit-and-run while under the influence of
alcohol in Osaka Jan. 20.</P>
      <P>Fujiwara took his wife to Taiwan two days later to try to avoid
prosecution. The couple stayed in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, and ran
a Japanese restaurant.</P>
      <P>Although Kaohsiung police did not catch Fujiwara engaging in any
shady dealings, his Taiwan visa expired, so the Bureau of Immigration
listed him as persona non grata and police expelled him.</P>
      <P>Fujiwara was deported from Kaohsiung to Japan via Hong Kong
Thursday afternoon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PREMIER: HEALTHY ECONOMIC SYSTEM CABINET PRIORITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i said Thursday that
a major task of the Cabinet is to construct a healthy economic system
so that Taiwan's vitality can be developed fully.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the annual conference of the National Association of
Small and Medium Enterprises in Taipei, Wu described sustained
economic development as Taiwan's lifeline.</P>
      <P>He said the Cabinet's efforts will be directed at five areas:
creating a good investment environment; encouraging the establishment
of information-based creative industries; setting up a fair financial
and monetary system; making the current economic system more open;
and working toward the formation of strategic alliances with other
countries.</P>
      <P>The vice premier praised Taiwan's small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) for their contributions to the nation and said
the government values the important role played by these enterprises
in the national economy.</P>
      <P>He pledged that the government will make more special loans and
tariff incentives available to SMEs in addition to helping them with
personnel training.</P>
      <P>On credit loans for SME businessmen, Wu said that in fiscal year
2004, credit assurance by a special fund had totaled 260,000 cases,
with the total amount reaching NT$315.7 billion. This had enabled
126,000 companies to obtain NT$500 billion in loans.</P>
      <P>He said an oversight committee of the Cabinet will conduct a
study with the view to making it more convenient for SMEs to
acquire needed loans.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Economics Minister Ho Mei-yueh
also lauded the contributions by the SMEs, noting that they have
hired 77 percent of Taiwan's workforce. She said the credit assurance
fund will consider raising the credit limit so that SMEs can get the
capital they need more easily.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HEALTH DEPARTMENT NOTIFIES WHO ABOUT ISOLATED CHOLERA CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH) informed the World Health Organization (WHO) Thursday
immediately upon the confirmation of an isolated indigenous cholera
case in southern Taiwan earlier that day, according to DOH
authorities.</P>
      <P>According to Chou Chih-hao, deputy director-general of the DOH's
Center for Disease Control (CDC), he notified the WHO Regional Office
for the Western Pacific located in Manila about the case -- a
toxic-producing vibrio cholerae O1 serotype ogawa, a notifiable
disease in the WHO's First Category -- in a 72-year-old woman living
in Hsinying, Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Since it is an isolated case and the first indigenous case
reported in Taiwan in five years, the WHO is not expected to declare
Taiwan a cholera affected area immediately, Chou said.</P>
      <P>After receiving prompt and adequate treatment, the woman was in
stable condition, Chou said, adding that although no further
suspected cases were detected by an epidemiological survey, the
health authorities would continue to monitor the situation.</P>
      <P>None of the woman's 37 family members, neighbors or healthcare
workers who have had contact with her have shown symptoms, Chou
noted.</P>
      <P>Noting that cholera is an acute bacterial enteric disease with an
incubation period of up to seven days, Taiwan can be assured that the
possibility of a cholera epidemic is zero if no similar cases are
reported islandwide by June 30, Chou added.</P>
      <P>According to CDC officials, the woman began suffering from
diarrhea and vomiting a week earlier after eating food bought from a
local market.</P>
      <P>Local health authorities collected samples from the market for
testing to try to identify the source of contamination, with the test
results expected June 26.</P>
      <P>CDC officials said that cholera is transmitted through ingestion
of contaminated food or water, or through the use of utensils
contaminated directly or indirectly with feces, vomitus or by the
fingers of infected persons. It can also be transmitted via flies and
cockroaches. Contaminated water is the most serious source of
infection.</P>
      <P>Vibrio cholerae lives in sea water and humans are the only
reservoir. Infection often is brought about by eating raw seafood
from polluted waters, they said.</P>
      <P>They added that vibrio cholerae is susceptible to gastric acid
and that infection can only be induced by the intake of a large
amount of bacteria.</P>
      <P>Although the case is not suspected of being a result of the June
12 flooding in southern Taiwan, the CDC urged the public in flooded
areas and elsewhere to eat only well-cooked food and to drink only
boiled or bottled water.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOARING OIL PRICES TO AFFECT TAIWAN'S EXPORT ORDERS: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports will be affected in the
short term by soaring international oil prices and China's moves to
cool down its overheated economy, a Ministry of Economic Affairs
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yaw-tzong, director-general of the MOEA's Statistics
Department, made the remarks after the ministry announced Taiwan's
export performance for May.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA statistics, the value of export orders received
by Taiwan manufacturers in May reached US$19.52 billion, an increase
of 13.14 percent over the same month of last year.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, the value of export orders received by Taiwan
manufacturers in the first five months totalled US$95.84 billion, a
growth of 17.61 percent over the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>The value of export orders for information and telecommunication
products reached US$3.55 billion, contributing the most to the growth
-- up by US$720 million -- over the same month of last year, while
electrical and machinery products registered a US$320 million growth
on a year-to-year basis.</P>
      <P>Noting that increasing oil prices have slowed down global
economic perspectives and that China's economic measures have
restrained the supply and demand for steel and petrochemical products
in Asia, Chang analyzed that Taiwan's exports will be affected in the
short term.</P>
      <P>However, the more-than-expected GDP growth in China, Japan and
the United States is expected to inject a stabilizing factor to the
global economy, Chang added.</P>
      <P>According to a recent survey, 23.86 percent of manufacturers
polled believe that export orders will increase in June, with 51.49
percent believing that export prospects will remain the same and
24.65 percent predicting that exports orders will decline during the
month.</P>
      <P>MOEA statistics also show that the industrial production index
stood at 129.76 in May, a drop of 1.42 percent over the same month of
last year, while the manufacturing production index registered
132.46, a decrease of 1.4 percent on a year-to-year basis.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, the industrial production index in the first five
months stood at 123.43, a decrease of 0.35 percent over the same
period of last year, while manufacturing production index registered
126.32, a decline of 0.85 percent over the same period of 2004.</P>

(IMD) , Chen said that science education in Taiwan's schools ranked
the sixth in the world in terms of quality and quantity, second only
to Singapore among all Asian countries and even better than Japan's.</P>
      <P>This indicates that Taiwan's well-established science and
technology education is an important asset to the country's strength
and a fact not to be taken lightly by the world, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during an audience at the Presidential

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT FREE TRADE ZONE SHOULD BE MODELED ON CEPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The establishment of a cross-Taiwan Strait
free trade zone should be modeled on the Closer Economic Partnership
Arrangement (CEPA) , Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research
Chairman Vincent Siew was quoted by a Hong Kong daily newspaper as
saying Thursday.</P>
      <P>Siew said that the CEPA among China, Hong Kong and Macau should
be set as a goal for Taiwan and China when the two sides establish a
cross-strait free trade zone, according to the Tai Kung Po.</P>
      <P>However, both sides would need to make more commitments on
customs incentives and reach consensus on currency and taxation
issues to allow a CEPA-style cross-strait free trade zone to be
established, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Noting that a cross-strait free trade zone is not a task that can
be achieved overnight, Siew, who is also chairman of the Cross
Straits Common Market Foundation, said it should be accomplished
step-by-step, with the first phase of the task normalization and
institutionalization of trade, postal and transportation relations
across the Taiwan Strait, better known as the "three direct links."</P>
      <P>Siew said that the "hot points" of the cross-strait economic and
trade cooperation should be "direct transportation links" and
Taiwanese businesses' moving toward inner provinces around China,
according to the Tai Kung Po report.</P>
      <P>Siew, who once served as premier when the now-opposition
Kuomintang was in power, also said that China's state-run enterprises
should cooperate with Taiwanese-financed companies more closely in
the future to create "win win" business synergies for both sides, the
Hong Kong daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN APPEARS IN COURT FOR ZANADAU CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
appeared in court Friday in person as a witness in the Zanadau
Development Corp. corruption trial.</P>
      <P>Lien was in court for 50 minutes to answer judges' questions
about the financial scandal involving former China Development
Holding Corp. Chairman Liu Tai-ying -- the main defendant -- and the
private Kaohsiung-based Zanadau Development Corp.</P>
      <P>Speaking after the trial session outside the court, Lien said
that he feels good about serving as a witness and doing his duty as a
citizen.</P>
      <P>Lien's appearance at the Taipei District Court Friday was the
former ROC vice president's first. In the past, he chose to have his
lawyers represent him in court for the various lawsuits that he had
filed or that had been filed against him.</P>
      <P>Lien responded to accusations made by Liu -- a confidant of
former President Lee Teng-hui and the chief of the Kuomintang's (KMT)
Business Management Committee between 1993 and 2000 -- that he
donated kickback money to Lien's 2000 presidential election campaign.</P>
      <P>Formerly the virtual treasurer of the KMT, Liu was indicted in
2003 in at least 12 criminal cases, including corruption, breach of
trust and forgery charges, as well as violations of the Securities
Transaction Law, the Corporation Law, the Money Laundering Control
Law and the Business Accounting Law.</P>
      <P>Su Hui-chen, a majority shareholder in Zanadau, accused Liu of
accepting a NT$1.06 billion (US$34.2 million) kickback from her in
return for a promise to help her secure bank financing in 1995.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also discovered that Liu used KMT assets to make
personal investments, including a huge amount of U.S. dollars in his
son's banking accounts.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court decided to lift the overseas travel ban
on Liu last June as investigations into Liu's role in most of the 12
cases had already been completed, he had reported to court for every
hearing, and he had put up bail of NT$60 million (US$1.79 million) .
Furthermore, none of the crimes Liu was alleged to have committed in
the 12 cases carries the death penalty, life imprisonment or a
minimum penalty of five-year imprisonment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ESTABLISHING TIES WITH CHINA MUST BE DEALT WITH CAREFULLY: VATICAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Vatican City,  June 23 (CNA)
(By P.C. Fan and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Vatican's foreign minister said
Thursday that establishing diplomatic ties between the Vatican and
China must be dealt with cautiously, although he himself does not
think that any difficulty is "insurmountable."</P>
      <P>Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo, who just returned from a trip to four
Southeast Asian countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia
and Brunei, made the comments while touching on issues related to the
Holy See's relations with China in an interview with Vatican Radio
Station.</P>
      <P>Saying that establishing diplomatic relations with China has long
been studied and examined, the archbishop, however, noted that one
should move carefully and asses some premises that cannot be violated
by either side.</P>
      <P>The Vatican recognizes China despite the fact that it does not
maintain official diplomatic relations with Beijing, the minister
said, adding that while talking about the recognition of a country,
one should first distinguish the fact of recognizing a country and a
government and the establishment of diplomatic relations with a
nation.</P>
      <P>For instance, Lajolo further said, although the Vatican has not
established diplomatic relations with Malaysia or Brunei, he was
still well received by the foreign ministers of the two countries
during his recent trip.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, an observer of Vatican politics predicted the same
day that the Vatican faces great difficulties in terms of
establishing diplomatic relations with China.</P>
      <P>According to the observer, the so-called "premises" mentioned by
the archbishop should include the Vatican's insistence on the
appointment of a bishop in China and the question of whether the
people on the mainland have complete freedom of religion. "They are
well aware of the obstacles in the establishment of diplomatic
relations between them," he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing has insisted for a long time that the Pope's right of
appointing bishops in China is an interference in China's internal
affairs and that freedom of religion should be subordinate to the
political authorities, he also said, adding: "This differs from the
Vatican's views, not to mention Beijing's request that the Holy See
must first break its official relations with Taiwan as a precondition
of establishing ties with China."</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the Vatican helps others and has never made
enemies, the observer said that it seems that Beijing wants to demand
that the Holy See do something against its own will to establish
relations with China while breaking ties with Taiwan at the same
time.</P>
      <P>"How can the Vatican and China establish diplomatic relations
within a short period of time after having procrastinated on the
issue for some 50 years?" he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official
urged the Taiwan Provincial Farmers' Association (TPFA) Friday to
respect the government's authority in dealing with farm exports to
China.</P>
      <P>The official made the call in the wake of a media report that
TPFA Chairman Liu Chuan-chung has reached a consensus with Chinese
authorities on matters concerning the certification and quarantine of
Taiwan fruit exports. The report said Beijing might recognize the
certificates of origin issued by the TPFA to facilitate the import of
Taiwan fruits into China.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung pointed out that the issuance of
certificates of origin is part of the government's authority and that
the TPFA has not been authorized by the government to negotiate with
China on issues related to farm exports.</P>
      <P>You said the MAC has requested the Council of Agriculture to
contact the TPFA to report to the government in one week on the
details of its talks with Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>He reminded the TPFA that it could violate the Statute Governing
the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland

    <TEXT>
      <P>Six workers were killed and another injured
when part of a balanced cantilever of an overpass under construction
along the express road leading to the Yuankang Fishing Port in
Hsiping, Miaoli County collapsed Thursday evening, sources from the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu proceeded to a local morgue in Tachia,
Taichung County, central Taiwan, first thing Friday morning to offer
the government's condolences toward the families of the deceased. One
of the six workers killed was a Thai national.</P>
      <P>The exact causes of the accident was still under investigations.</P>
      <P>Chen offered NT$100,000 (US$3,226) to each of the families of the
victims. She also promised that the CLA will see to it that the
contractor, BES Engineering Corp., and relevant sub-contractors will
face the music and pay compensation for the workers who were killed
or injured.</P>
      <P>After examining the accident scene, prosecutors and labor affairs
officials tentatively labeled it as an accident as a result of human
error and negligence, adding that the matter should be dealt with
according to the law.</P>
      <P>The BES authorities promised Friday that the company will help
the families take care of all matters regarding the funerals for the
victims and will not evade their responsibilities in the wake of the
accident.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CLA officials said that the ill-fated construction
site has been checked by local labor affairs officials 31 times since
construction began. During the monitoring process, they said, the
contractor was ordered to suspend its construction 11 times, with
fines totaling NT$1.38 million.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China is the world's largest source and
market for counterfeit goods and the poor-quality products that it
makes will seriously hurt its economy and pose a major latent threat
to public security, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman You
Ying-lung claimed Friday.</P>
      <P>Citing the finding of a report commissioned by the MAC, You said
that due to the Chinese authorities' lax controls, about 70 percent
of the world's bootleg products come from China, ranging from
brand-name clothing to medicine. Nearly 90 percent of consumers have
purchased such fake products, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics compiled by China's General Administration of
Quality Supervision and Quarantine, You said that counterfeit goods
worth a total of 11.1 billion renminbi were seized by Chinese law
enforcement authorities from April 2001 to October 2004, posing great
losses to consumers and original producers.</P>
      <P>According to the report, China's increased counterfeiting has
seriously hit many worldwide famous brands and it has become an
international issue.</P>
      <P>Estimates show that U. S. enterprises suffer as much as US$250
billion in business losses each year due to mainly China-made
counterfeit products, according to the report, which added that
various upscale brand names have halted plans to enter the Chinese
market as a result.</P>
      <P>The report ascribed the rampant counterfeiting in China to
various factors that include a lack of public respect for
intellectual property rights, lax government regulations and
punishments and strong local demand. China's vast size has also
helped worsen the problem, it added.</P>

      <P>From July 1, all nonresident passengers
bound for China will be required to pay tax on any merchandise they
carry for personal consumption that exceeds 2,000 renminbi (about
NT$8,000) in value, according to the Customs General Administration
of China.</P>
      <P>The new regulations announced by China's Customs authorities
Thursday will also subject in-bound resident passengers to the new
tariffs on any goods they carry that exceed 5,000 renminbi in total
value.</P>
      <P>It was not clear whether Taiwan businessmen and students residing
in China will be treated as either residents or nonresidents and
officials at the Customs General Administration declined to answer
inquiries in this regard.</P>
      <P>News reports from China say that the value of goods will be
determined by invoices. If a passenger fails to produce such
invoices, Customs officials will set the value by consulting a
uniform schedule of prices for general merchandise.</P>
      <P>All passengers will be required to itemize the goods they carry
by filling out a form. Any individuals carrying goods valued at over
50,000 renminbi or company workers with goods exceeding 150,000
renminbi that fail to file claims will be charged with smuggling.</P>
      <P>Experts believe the new customs tariffs will affect the shopping
habits of certain consumers and they have warned that those who go to
Hong Kong or Macau on shopping sprees might find that after paying
the tax, the goods they have bought may not necessary be cheaper than
those purchased domestically.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The next elections for township and village
heads will be held at year end as scheduled, despite calls by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for them to be abolished,
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that the Law on Local Government Systems will
have to be amended before the elections can be abolished and that the
amendment might not be accomplished before the elections are due.</P>
      <P>Also, a proposal to hold a referendum on the issue will need to
be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan, a process that can take up to
six months, Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>The government has decided to hold the next elections for
township and village heads Dec. 3 together with two other local
elections, namely, those for city and county chiefs as well as city
and county councilors.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has recently suggested that a referendum
be held alongside the elections to let the people vote on whether the
township and village elections should be abolished and for chiefs at
that level to be appointed positions.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the Cabinet has already submitted its
proposed amendment to the Law on Local Government Systems to the
legislature, but the bill failed to win the support of opposition
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet will submit a similar bill to the legislature during
its next session starting in September, Hsieh said, adding that a
referendum will be needed if there are problems resolving the
partisan differences over the government's plan to abolish the
elections.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, a group of opposition Kuomintang legislators
expressed their objection to Chen's proposal to hold a referendum
alongside the elections, calling it a tactic to boost the campaign of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the year-end
elections.</P>
      <P>Lin Hung-chih said that when holding three elections
simultaneously is already a heavy burden for electoral workers, their
workload will increase further if a referendum is to be held at the
same time.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that abolishing the township and village elections
will damage the country's democracy and local self-government system,
because the ruling party could offer the appointments of township and
village heads as favors to local politicians.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Yu-sheng urged the DPP not to use referendums as a
tool to make political gains disregarding the overall development of
the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN TRIES TO STEER CLEAR OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan apparently tried to steer clear of the KMT campaign funds for
the 2000 presidential election in court Friday, where he appeared as
a witness in the Zanadau Development Corp. corruption trial.</P>
      <P>Lien was in court for 50 minutes to answer judges' questions
about the financial scandal involving former China Development
Holding Corp. Chairman Liu Tai-ying -- the main defendant -- and the
private Kaohsiung-based Zanadau Development Corp.</P>
      <P>Lien responded to accusations made by Liu -- a confidant of
former President Lee Teng-hui and the chief of the KMT's Business
Management Committee between 1993 and 2000 -- that he donated
kickback money to Lien's 2000 presidential election campaign.</P>
      <P>Noting that all campaign funds were handled by a KMT finance
committee, Lien claimed to have "no idea" about how the funds were
raised or spent and that he had never been shown related account
books.</P>
      <P>Taipei prosecutors claimed that Liu, formerly the virtual
treasurer of the KMT, instructed KMT-run businesses to buy stocks in
Typhone Industries, a pineapple cannery that diversified its
operations to other fields including building and venture capital
businesses, between 1999 and 2000.</P>
      <P>In a reciprocal gesture, according to the prosecutors, Typhone
owner Huang Tsung-hung handed 17 checks worth a total of NT$160
million (US$5.16 million) to Liu. Of the total, the prosecutors said,
Liu stole NT$44 million, which later appeared in the bank accounts of
his two sons.</P>
      <P>Liu's lawyers denied prosecutors' charges that Liu embezzled the
NT$44 million, saying that the amount was channeled into the KMT
coffers to be used as the 2000 presidential election campaign funds.</P>
      <P>During the court session, Lien also denied that he knew anything
about the sources of NT$7 billion in campaign funds that former
President Lee Teng-hui, who was KMT chairman in March 2000, once
claimed that the KMT had raised for the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The court did not order Lien to confront Liu during Friday's
session.</P>
      <P>Lien's appearance at the Taipei District Court was the former
vice president's first. In the past, he chose to have his lawyers
represent him in court for the various lawsuits that he had filed or
that had been filed against him.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors handling the Zanadau scandal case also subpoenaed Lee
to appear in court Nov. 12, 2003.</P>
      <P>Liu was indicted in 2003 in at least 12 criminal cases, including
corruption, breach of trust and forgery charges, as well as
violations of the Securities Transaction Law, the Corporation Law,
the Money Laundering Control Law and the Business Accounting Law.</P>
      <P>Su Hui-chen, a majority shareholder in Zanadau, accused Liu of
accepting a NT$1.06 billion (US$34.2 million) kickback from her in
return for a promise to help her secure bank financing in 1995.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court decided to lift an overseas travel ban
on Liu last June as investigations into his role in most of the 12
cases had already been completed. He had reported to court for every
hearing and had put up bail of NT$60 million (US$1.79 million) .
Furthermore, none of the crimes Liu was alleged to have committed in
the 12 cases carries the death penalty, life imprisonment or a
minimum penalty of five years' imprisonment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEN URGED TO DISCARD BUSINESS SUITS DURING SUMMER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of women's rights and
environmentally conscious activists called Friday for the country's
men to discard business suits in Taiwan's scorching summer and
instead wear casual shirts to reduce reliance on air conditioning.</P>
      <P>The activists, led by Legislator-at-Large Huang Shu-ying of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, urged the men to get rid of
business suits during summer to help save energy, particularly at a
time when energy sources have become increasingly expensive.</P>
      <P>Noting that air conditioning is the prime reason for surging
power consumption in summer, Huang said that one degree higher on air
conditioner thermostats around Taiwan in summer means the country
could save 300 million kwhs -- an amount of electricity sufficient
for residents of Penghu Island to use for an entire year.</P>
      <P>Wearing business suits requires a temperature of between 22-23
degrees Celsius to make an office or room comfortable in summer,
Huang said, claiming that the room temperature can be higher, which
will save some energy, if men were to wear cooler casual shirts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREPARATORY MEETING FOR TAIWAN-JAPAN FISHERY TALKS SET FOR JULY 12</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 24 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A preparatory meeting for the 15th round of
Taiwan-Japan fishery talks will be held July 12 in Tokyo, a Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Both sides had earlier agreed to hold the fishery talks July 29,
also in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA spokesman Michel Lu, the government will fight
for the best interests of the country and seek to resolve the fishery
dispute between Taiwan and Japan in a pragmatic and flexible manner.</P>
      <P>Before the talks start, ministry officials will visit lawmakers
and meet with scholars, legal experts and fishermen's representatives
to gather their opinions on the issue, Lu said.</P>
      <P>At the heart of the dispute is the disputed sovereignty claim
over the Tiaoyutai Islands -- a group of uninhabited islets in the
East China Sea located some 120 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan
proper. The island group is claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>The previous 14 rounds of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks did not make
significant headway because Taiwan would not forsake its sovereignty
claim to the Tiaoyutais, which Japan has held since 1972.</P>
      <P>Both Tokyo and Taipei claim that the island group falls within
their exclusive economic zones. Japan often fines ship owners and
impounds Taiwanese fishing vessels that enter waters close to the
Tiaoyutais.</P>
      <P>The dispute came into the limelight again recently after some 50
Taiwan fishing boats staged a rare protest in the disputed waters
following the latest expulsion of fishermen from the area. Under
strong pressure from opposition lawmakers, the military sent a
Knox-class frigate to patrol the disputed waters for one afternoon
early this week, supposedly to accentuate the government's
determination to protect fishermen's rights and safety.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA CONTINUES MILITARY DEPLOYMENT AGAINST TAIWAN: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has continued to step up its military
buildup against Taiwan, despite having invited two Taiwan opposition
leaders to visit China earlier this year, a senior official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Quoting a Chinese government internal circular, Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Vice Chairman You Ying-lung said the Beijing
authorities have also directed their overseas diplomatic missions to
intensify international publicity to accentuate that the Chinese
people are wise enough to resolve their "internal" cross-Taiwan
Strait dispute on their own.</P>
      <P>According to You, the circular was distributed to Communist Party
of China cadres as well as Chinese government officials, overseas
staff and military officers in the second half of May after two
Taiwan opposition leaders -- Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People
First Party Chairman James Soong -- visited China on separate
occasions between late April and early May.</P>
      <P>"The content of the circular indicates that China, while inviting
Taiwan's opposition leaders to open up a new platform for its
Taiwan-targeting work and sowing discord in Taiwan society, has
continued its military deployment against Taiwan and suppression
against Taiwan's international presence," You said.</P>
      <P>The circular claims that as the situation in Taiwan remains
"grim, " the military must continue to escalate its Taiwan-targeting
combat preparedness, You said.</P>
      <P>The document also points out that inviting Lien and Soong was a
major policy strategy aimed at winning the hearts and minds of the
people of Taiwan and at forging ties with various political parties
and groups in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It further says the enactment of its anti-secession law will
contribute to China's drive to impede the pro-independence force in
Taiwan. Nevertheless, it adds that as pro-independence activists have
not ceased secessionist activities and anti-Chinese foreign forces
have continued to obstruct a solution to the Taiwan issue, the
People's Liberation Army must not ease its combat preparedness
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, You said, the circular directs Chinese diplomats
to strengthen a publicity campaign telling the international
community that the Chinese people have the wisdom to resolve their
own "internal" disputes.</P>
      <P>"Chinese foreign missions are also ordered to take active steps
to prevent the United States from developing official ties and
military cooperation with Taiwan, foil any U.S. attempts to cooperate
with Japan over the Taiwan issue, and strengthen the European Union's
and Russia's pro-China stance on the Taiwan issue," You said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, You said, the circular demands that Chinese diplomats
make every possible effort to impede Taiwan's bid to join the United
Nations and its affiliates, while appropriately dealing with
Taiwan-related affairs in professional international bodies and
non-government organizations.</P>
      <P>In terms of the content of the circular, You said, China has not
shown any flexibility toward the Taiwan Strait issue in the wake of
the two opposition leaders' China visits and will continue its
all-out efforts to thwart Taiwan's bid to join major international
organizations and activities.</P>
      <P>For years, You said, China has consistently kept in place a
comprehensive package of strategic and tactical measures toward
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The recently obtained Chinese internal circular proves that
China will not forsake its two-pronged, carrot-and-stick ploy against
Taiwan after the visits by Lien and Soong," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The business climate index of Taiwan's
service industry registered 115.57 points in May, an increase of 1.07
percentage points from the April level, according to a report
conducted by the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER).</P>
      <P>The growth in the business climate index of the service industry
in May was in contrast to the business climate index of the
manufacturing industry in the same month, which stood at 92.34
points, the lowest since July 2001, and represented a drop of 4.26
percentage points from the April level.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that TIER announced the business climate
index for the service industry, the TIER officials said.</P>
      <P>The TIER report surveyed eight main categories of service
industry, including retail, restaurants and travel, construction,
banking, stocks and securities, insurance, telecommunications and
transport.</P>
      <P>While only 9.7 percent of Taiwan manufacturers surveyed by TIER
believed that the economic prospects were optimistic in May, the
business climate index of the service industry demonstrated that
domestic consumption can enjoy moderate growth despite soaring prices
of merchandise and a moderate unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>The report found that almost all companies of the eight
categories in the service industry believed that their sales will
increase in the next three months, with only the banking sector
believing that overdue loans will aggravate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRUG TRAFFICKERS  USING GUANGZHOU AS TRANSIT POINT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Macau, June 24 (CNA)
(By C.H. Jen and Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Narcotics traffickers are increasingly using
Guangzhou, the capital of China's coastal province of Guangdong, as a
transit point for smuggling illicit drugs to Macau, Hong Kong, other
parts of China and neighboring countries, customs officials of
Guangdong said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the statement following the seizure of more
than eight kilograms of ketamine powder from the luggage of two
Malaysian passengers at Baiyun Airport in Guangzhou -- the largest
quantity of ketamine ever seized at Chinese ports of entry.</P>
      <P>Since September last year, customs officials at Baiyun Airport
have cracked 10 illicit drug smuggling cases. Eight of these had to
do with ketamine; one was for heroin and one for marijuana.</P>
      <P>According to Guangdong Customs officials, most of the ketamine
powder was found in the luggage of Malaysian passengers who flew from
Kuala Lumpur to Guangzhou, but more recently the route has been to go
to Singapore by car and then fly from there to Guangzhou so as not to
attract the attention of Chinese Customs officials.</P>
      <P>A senior customs official said that of those arrested in
Guangzhou for narcotics trafficking during the past six months, nine
were Malaysians of Chinese origin, three were Singaporeans, one was a
resident of Hong Kong, and two were citizens of China. Eighty percent
of them were gamblers who had run up large debts.</P>
      <P>Ketamine, a non-barbiturate, fast-acting disassociative
anesthetic used on both animals and humans, is being abused by an
increasing number of young people as a "club drug." The drug can
elicit an out-of-body or near-death experience, but can also make the
user comatose.</P>
      <P>Chinese statistics show that 806 kilograms of ketamine was seized
in 2004 at different ports of entry. Such smuggling cases are on the
rise because the drug can generate relatively big profits for the
traffickers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRADE GROUP CALLS FOR WIDER OPENING TO CHINESE TOURISTS, INVESTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opening Taiwan further to Chinese tourists
and investors would generate good revenues for Taiwan businesses, the
General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China said recently.</P>
      <P>The business group raised the proposal two days ago in a board
meeting, suggesting that the government allow visits by Chinese
tourists to Taiwan as soon as possible and permit Chinese investment
in the domestic real estate market.</P>
      <P>This would help Taiwan's economy, since the flow has been
predominately one way -- outward from Taiwan to China, the group
said.</P>
      <P>Citing estimates by aviation sources, the group said that opening
Taiwan to Chinese tourists would help carriers increase their
business volumes by about 21 percent.</P>
      <P>Given that the government plans to permit 300,000 Chinese people
to sightsee in Taiwan each year in the initial stage, this would
create at least NT$12 billion (US$385 million) in annual business for
the domestic tourist industry based on a per-capita spending of
NT$38,000, the group said.</P>
      <P>Statistics made public by world tourist organizations show that
nearly 22 million tourists visited Hong Kong last year, making Hong
Kong one of the top 10 most popular tourist destinations across the
world.</P>
      <P>The tallies also show that the 2004 figure marks a noticeable
growth of more than 40 percent over the 2003 level -- the world's
highest increase rate which analysts said was a result of an influx
of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>A total of some 1.1 million foreign tourists traveled to Taiwan
in the first four months of this year, a rise of 18.5 percent
compared to the previous year's level, the group said, but pointed
out that Taiwan must open up to Chinese visitors if the government
wants to succeed in its plan of doubling tourist arrivals by 2008.</P>
      <P>In addition, the group also asked the government to allow Chinese
people to invest in Taiwan's real estate markets in view of the
fast-increasing trade and economic links between the two sides.</P>
      <P>It said that the government should allow Chinese investors to buy
property in Taiwan as there is a growing need for them to do so to
set up offices or shops here.</P>
      <P>To date, Taiwan investment in China has already surpassed US$100
billion, but the Taiwan market remains intact for Chinese investors,
it said.</P>
      <P>Despite a government announcement that Taiwan will soon brace for
Chinese tourists, no concrete measures have been put in place so far
to serve that end amid high expectations from the private sector.</P>
      <P>Stanley Yen, chairman of the Taiwan Visitors Association, called
Wednesday on the government in a seminar to move as quickly as
possible and urged it to hold substantive talks with China to avoid
possible negative consequences, such as absconding en masse of some
Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Yen said that it is the government responsibility to talk over
the issue with China and ask the Chinese side to take measures to
fend off any such re-occurrences.</P>
      <P>The famous hotelier also called for a standard practice in
receiving Chinese tourists. He maintained that there must be no
differences in treating visitors from China, because doing so will
help Chinese people better understand Taiwan and improve the
country's international image.</P>
      <P>Experts in the seminar also suggested the government allow Sung
Shan Airport in Taipei to operate direct flights from Shanghai's
Hongqiao International Airport.</P>

      <P>Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems has
won a contract to supply Taiwan with an ultra high frequency phased
array radar system to upgrade Taiwan's missile and air defense
capabilities, the U.S. Department of Defense said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The early warning system includes an ultra high frequency phased
array radar integrated with Taiwan-furnished identification
friend-or-foe beacons, two missile warning centers, communications
and interface architecture and protocol to specified Taiwan mission
elements via the Taiwan military communications infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon said the contract carries a price tag of US$752
million and that the new missile and air defense system is scheduled
for completion by September 2009.</P>
      <P>Military experts said the ultra high frequency phased array radar
system will enable Taiwan to detect signals of ballistic missiles and
cruise missiles fired by China in a very early stage.</P>
      <P>The system to be supplied by Raytheon is one of the two early
warning systems that Taiwan proposed to purchase more than a year
ago.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon notified the Congress of its decision to sell Taiwan

      <P>The people of Guatemala treasure their
country's relations with the Republic of China, and the diplomatic
ties between the two countries will not change, Guatemala Congress
President Jorge Mendez Herbruger said Friday.</P>
      <P>Mendez made the remarks in a news conference prior to his
departure after concluding a six-day visit in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that the current visit to China by Guatemalan Economics
Minister Marcio Cuevas will not affect the diplomatic ties between
Taiwan and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>During Cuevas's Beijing visit, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has
demonstrated its willingness to forge diplomatic ties with Guatemala
and other Central American countries, where most of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies are.</P>
      <P>The Guatemalan government has stated that Cuevas' Beijing visit
is aimed at strengthening economic and trade ties with China.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether the strengthening of economic and business
relations between Guatemala and China will lead to the establishment
of diplomatic ties, Mendez said entering the Chinese market is a
global trend and Guatemala does not want to be absent from that
market.</P>
      <P>But Guatemala will not shift its diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing as its people value very much its relations with
the ROC, he added.</P>
      <P>Besides, the economic and trade cooperation between Guatemala and
China is still under initial assessment, Mendez said. Citing the
example of Taiwan and China, Mendez said, "We have not seen much
political changes and contacts between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait even after Taiwanese businessmen have invested so much in
China."</P>
      <P>Mendez also revealed that Guatemala President Ocar Berger will
visit Taiwan in August to attend the inauguration of the Democratic
Pacific Union initiated by Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>At that time, Berger is expected to sign a Taiwan-Guatemala free

      <P>SEF Secretary-General Liu Teh-hsun made the appeal in view of the
growing number of cross-strait fraud cases based out of mainland
China.</P>
      <P>It was reported that the public security agency in Xiamen City
uncovered recently a fraud group, detaining 151 suspects, with 28 of
them Taiwanese. The targets of the group were all Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Liu said the SEF has sent a letter to its Chinese counterpart --
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- in
Beijing, asking it to coordinate with related Chinese agencies so
that the latter can offer more information and send back those
Taiwanese suspects for further investigation.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is difficult for Taiwan law enforcement agencies
to uncover cross-strait criminal rings, and the current cooperation
between the two sides is limited, Liu urged both sides of the Taiwan
Strait to sign an agreement as soon as possible in which a regular
criminal reporting mechanism can be established for the early
settlement of cross-strait criminal cases.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SEES LITTLE POSSIBILITY OF MEETING WITH CHINESE COUNTERPART</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday he sees
little possibility of meeting with his Chinese counterpart in the
foreseeable future because China has set too many conditions.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in an interview with the Central
Broadcasting System of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he is likely to meet with Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao, Hsieh said that in terms of past experience and China's
present status quo, the possibility of such a meeting is almost nil.</P>
      <P>"China has erected too many roadblocks. I would not accept any
preconditions that would undermine our national dignity simply for
the sake of holding a so-called Hsieh-Wen meeting," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has insisted that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait resume talks under the premise of "one China, " Hsieh said
Taiwan would forfeit its international status if it were to accept
such a precondition.</P>
      <P>"Beijing has consistently demanded its diplomatic allies
recognize that Taiwan is part of China and that the People's Republic
of China is the sole legitimate government of China. If we accept
Beijing's 'one China' principle, it is tantamount to forsaking our
international personalty simply for resuming cross-strait talks, "
Hsieh said, adding that Beijing's "one China" principle is the
biggest obstacle to resuming cross-strait dialogue because Taiwan
cannot talk with China at the expense of its sovereignty.</P>
      <P>So long as China is willing to remove such a precondition or
prerequisite, Hsieh said, the two sides can resume talks right now.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the opening of direct cross-strait charter passenger
flights earlier this year for the return of Taiwan businessmen from
China for the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations set a good example
for the two sides to sit down to talk pragmatically without setting
any preconditions.</P>
      <P>"We hope the two sides can follow that good example in opening
talks on cross-strait charter cargo flights in the near future. The
two sides can mutually respect each other's stance, but neither
should set a precondition for talks," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The premier further said the so-called "China fever" fueled by
the controversial visits to China by two Taiwan opposition leaders --
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James
Soong has cooled off as evidenced in the results of the May 14
National Assembly election.</P>
      <P>"While Taiwan people generally like to increase civilian
exchanges and cultural interactions with China, they are very
sensitive to political issues. China has little appeal to most Taiwan
people when touching on political systems. The majority of Taiwan
people want freedom, democracy and a market economy rather than a
totalitarian communist system," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLD SPOTLIGHT ON CHINA DIMS TAIWAN'S GLOBAL PROFILE: SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Chao Yen and Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's improved international image is
likely to make it more difficult for Taiwan to participate in
international organizations, two mainland affairs experts said
Friday.</P>
      <P>A global poll conducted by the U.S-based Pew Research Center for
the People and the Press showed that China is viewed more favorably
than the United States in many of the 16 countries surveyed,
especially in Europe and Asia, although there is still considerable
wariness about its growing economic and military strength.</P>
      <P>Dr. Kenneth K. Wang, director of the Institute of International
Affairs and Strategic Studies at Tamkang University, told the Central
News Agency in an interview that compared with U.S. President George
W. Bush's "iron-fist" policy, China's soft approach of seeking
economic cooperation with other countries is definitely more
appealing.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed the fear that China's improved image in the world
may enable Beijing to persuade more countries to accept its "one
China" policy, thus blocking Taiwan from participating in world
organizations.</P>
      <P>In his view, Taiwan should make more efforts to let other
countries see more clearly the benefits they may have in expanding
economic cooperation with Taiwan. He suggested that Taiwan should
also let the world know its democratic achievements and make them see
Taiwan as a peace-loving country, rather than a destabilizing factor.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-cheng, professor at the Institute of Mainland China
Studies of National Sun Yat-sen University, pointed out that the Iraq
War that led to Saddam Hussein's removal was the main reason for
America's poor image, as shown by results of the poll.</P>
      <P>Lin warned that China's "peaceful rise" should not be taken
lightly, as it has already produced far-reaching effects in many
countries. As a consequence, Taiwan's interests may be sacrificed,
with Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization being a
prominent example.</P>
      <P>In his opinion, Taiwan should step up its publicity campaign
internationally and make timely responses to any issue taken by China
so as to allow the world to understand Taiwan's position.</P>

      <P>An F-16 jet fighter veered off the runway
while landing at the Chiayi Air Base in southern Taiwan Friday. No
one was hurt in the mishap although the airport which is shared by
civilian airplanes was forced to close, according to a statement

    <HEADLINE>TURN FLOOD-PRONE TOWNSHIPS INTO HONEYMOON VILLAGES: VP LU</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu suggested turning
low-lying coastal area in central and southern Taiwan, which are
plagued by flooding, into villages for honeymooners.</P>
      <P>Huddling with chiefs of these flood-prone townships, the vice
president said honeymoon villages could attract tourists with their
rich natural resources of wetlands and culture.</P>
      <P>Noting that the state-run Taiwan Sugar Corporation owns a wetland
farm in Tungshi township of Chiayi, Lu said the honeymoon villages
could start from this farm, called Aogu, in light of the fact that
the company is prepared to try this idea out.</P>
      <P>Lu floated the idea in an attempt to help residents in these
townships to turn disasters into opportunities.</P>
      <P>Warning that the world is entering a disastrous era, Lu urged
residents living in low-lying areas to brace for natural disasters
prompted by people's unchecked exploitation of nature.</P>
      <P>These townships were subject to frequent flooding owing to the
subsidence of land caused by excessive groundwater pumping in the
last decades for fish farming.</P>
      <P>Hardly a year goes by without these areas being inundated in
waist-deep water brought by either typhoons or torrential rain.</P>
      <P>Lu was obviously inspired by Lee Hung-yuan, a professor at
National Taiwan University who recommended at Friday's meeting to
change the way the land in the area is used which is no longer
suitable for farming because of the increasing ground salinity.</P>
      <P>He suggested converting these flood-prone areas into tourist
attractions as a series of wetland parks.</P>
      <P>No decision was taken in Friday's meeting as the vice president

      <P>An early warning surveillance radar system

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CONFIDENT NEW CONSTITUTION WILL BE READY BY 2008</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  25  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed
confidence Saturday that he will give Taiwan a new constitution that
is timely, relevant and viable by the time he steps down in 2008.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of a new discourse on national sovereignty
and the fading of old ideology, Taiwan is now ready to promote
across-the-board reforms to the Constitution, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes the second phase of constitutional reforms
will be no more difficult than the first and that he is willing to
act as the midwife who will assist with the birth of the new
constitution.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while addressing a symposium on
sovereignty, constitution and the future of Taiwan held by the Taiwan
Law Society.</P>
      <P>Chen said that what he called "an illusionary and stiff greater
China ideology" has seriously confused the national status and
identity of Taiwan over the past five decades and has led to
procrastination and hampering of the development of democracy and
constitutional government in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It will be impossible for Taiwan to become a normal country
enjoying independent sovereignty, freedom and democracy unless it
frees itself from this unrealistic political dogma," Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, sovereignty not only means the right to be one
own's master but also means the will to be one own's master.</P>
      <P>With the democratization of the country, the wish of the
Taiwanese people to be their own master has been realized and a clear
and specific national sovereignty consciousness has taken shape, Chen
claimed.</P>
      <P>"The Republic of China is an independent, sovereign state. Its
sovereignty belongs to all the people in Taiwan. Only the 23 million
people in Taiwan have the right to determine the future of Taiwan, "
he said.</P>
      <P>"Such discourse is not only consistent with the democratic
principles of sovereignty of the people and self-determination, but
it also honestly reflects the status quo in reality, " he claimed.</P>
      <P>By replacing the old sovereignty concept dominated by a "greater
China consciousness" with this practical discourse, it will be
helpful to the unity and ethnic harmony of Taiwan and will facilitate
subsequent constitutional reforms, he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has conducted seven rounds of constitutional
reforms in the past decade because the "greater China consciousness"
has prevented the country from making comprehensive changes to the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chen has pledged to promote a second phase of constitutional
reforms following amendments passed early this month under which the
National Assembly was abolished to allow for popular referendums on
future constitutional reforms.</P>
      <P>He has promised that the second phase of reforms will not involve
sensitive issues such as changes to the country's sovereignty,
territorial boundaries or official designation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW SEF HEAD VOWS TO PROMOTE CROSS-STRAIT WELFARE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25(CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly appointed chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) has vowed to promote the welfare of the
people on either side of the Taiwan Strait, a local reporter said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hsiung, former premier and former secretary-general of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), was recently appointed
by President Chen Shui-bian to lead the SEF, the quasi-official body
set up to deal with cross-strait relations in the absence of official
ties between the two sides of the strait, after former SEF President
Koo Chen-fu died in January this year.</P>
      <P>Chang, who has also served as Presidential Office
secretary-general and as a legislator for seven consecutive terms,
has long been a close partner and political heavyweight trusted by
the president, according to the reporter.</P>
      <P>Chen hopes Chang can help him open a window of opportunity for
the strained cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China experienced a period of harmonious interaction
and exchanges since historic talks between Koo and Wang Daohan,
chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) in 1993, the reporter said.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the cross-strait consultation channels broke down
in 1999 and the death of Koo interrupted the experience accumulated
by the SEF and ARATS.</P>
      <P>The new SEF head has been described, even by some opposition
party members, as an honest, modest and respectable politician
capable of resolving disputes.</P>
      <P>Within the DPP, Chang is a pragmatic advocate of strengthening
cross-strait exchanges. He worked on pushing the passage of the DPP's
1999 resolution on Taiwan's future, saying that Taiwan and China
should improve their mutual understanding and economic and trade
cooperation through wide-ranging dialogue in order to establish a
peaceful framework and durable stability between the two sides.</P>
      <P>To put into practice the resolution, Chang as premier not only
loosened the restrictions set by former President Lee Teng-hui on
cross-strait economic and trade exchanges, but also adopted a policy
to help promote economic and trade exchanges between the two sides of
the strait. Throughout his tenure as premier, Chang also urged both
sides to engage in dialogue without preconditions.</P>
      <P>He was also the first DPP member to suggest that the president
ameliorate and normalize cross-strait relations after last year's
legislative elections. His pushing for better ties between the two
sides was an important factor the president's selection of him to
fill the vacancy left by Koo.</P>
      <P>Chen has reiterated several times since he became president that
he would honor his "five noes" commitment. He has also said that he
did not change the principles for dealing with China during his first
term and that such principles and commitments will remain unchanged
in his second term.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen took the further step earlier this year of
pushing for an agreement on direct cross-strait charter flights,
expressing the hope that by doing so, Taiwan and China can jointly
create a new era of consultation.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, there will be relative cross-strait stability
from now until 2008 as in Taiwan, Chen is seen as someone who will
not betray the nation's interests in any talks with China.</P>
      <P>Besides, by reaching an agreement with opposition PFP Chairman
James Soong in a meeting in February, Chen also promised that he will
not declare independence, will not change the designation of the
nation and will not push for a unification vs. independence
referendum that will change the status quo, Chang said.</P>
      <P>This is the most important common factor reached by the ruling
DPP and the opposition after they encountered pressure from the
public, he went on, adding that this also shows certain similarities
to the spirit of the four points set by Chinese President Hu Jintao
in dealing with cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Claiming that China's Anti-Secession Law sees anti-independence
as more important than reunification, Chang said that this, along
with the DPP's main idea of maintaining the status quo in the Taiwan
Strait and seeking cross-strait peace, have actually created room for
reconciliation and coexistence between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the coming three years will be a golden opportunity
for building a peaceful framework between Taiwan and China, according
to Chang. " If we miss these precious three years, nobody can predict
the future development in the strait," he claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES OPPOSITION TO SUPPORT 2ND-PHASE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmaker called on opposition parties Saturday to support
President Chen Shui-bian's bid to promote a second phase of
constitutional reforms.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chin-jun, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus,
making Taiwan a "normal country" is one of the president's top
concerns and the country needs a timely, relevant and viable
constitution in order to achieve that goal.</P>
      <P>Chen said the passage of a constitutional amendment package
through the National Assembly early this month was a show of the
power of the people.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the president hopes to continue this momentum to
promote a second phase of reforms to address issues such as whether
to change the country's political system to a presidential system or
parliamentary system; whether the Taiwan provincial government should
be abolished; lowering the voting age from 20 to 18; and adopting a
voluntary military service system, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, President Chen expressed confidence that he
will give Taiwan a new constitution that is timely, relevant and
viable by the time he steps down in 2008.</P>
      <P>The president said Taiwan is now ready to promote
across-the-board reforms to the Constitution following the
establishment of a new discourse on national sovereignty and that he
believes the second phase of constitutional reforms will be no more
difficult than the first.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, convener of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
legislative caucus, said his party supports the promotion of a second
phase of constitutional reforms.</P>
      <P>However, Ho said he is pessimistic about the prospects of success
of the reforms in light of the high threshold required for the
passage of constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment package passed early this month,
popular referendums will be held on future constitutional amendments.
It requires the approval of at least three-quarters of the eligible
voters, or more than 8 million people, before the amendments can be
considered passed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party
(PFP) lawmakers expressed objections to the president's plan to make
further changes to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, who also heads the party's
Policy Committee, claimed that the country "needs some rest" after
the last constitutional reforms and he urged the president to use the
rest of his term to implement political reforms and improve the
economy.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with Tseng, PFP legislative caucus convener Chen
Chih-pin said the DPP should prioritize domestic and economic issues
instead of focusing on constitutional reforms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION TO PLAY IMPORTANT ROLE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official from the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research (TIER) predicted Saturday that domestic consumption
will play a pivotal role in the country's economic growth.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks in consideration of the gradual but
stable growth in Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) , the value of Taiwan's exports reached US$16.32 billion in
May, an increase of 4.0 percent over the same month of last year.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, the value of export orders received by Taiwan
manufacturers in the first five months totalled US$74.81 billion, a
growth of 7.6 percent over the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Analyzing Taiwan's export performance in the second half of this
year, the TIER official predicted that exports will maintain a
certain level of growth.</P>
      <P>However, due to soaring prices of oil and other raw materials,
the growth in value of imports will surpass that of exports,
gradually reducing the island's trade surplus, the official added.</P>
      <P>Although orders received by Taiwanese manufacturers have usually
set new records, the manufacturing production index has not risen in
accordance with the growth pace of export orders, due largely to the
fact that a growing number of these export goods are made in Taiwan
companies' overseas plants.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA statistics, the manufacturing production
index stood at 132.46 in May, a decrease of 1.4 percent on a
year-to-year basis, while the manufacturing production index in the
first five months registered 126.32, a decline of 0.85 percent over
the same period of 2004.</P>
      <P>Forecasting that exports will see a growth at a slower pace in
the next six months due to stable economic growth in the United
States and China, the official predicted that domestic consumption
will play a greater contribution to the country's economic growth.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will reconsider its ban on
U.S. beef under certain conditions, a Department of Health (DOH)
official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>These conditions include the release of pathological information
concerning the second case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
found in the United States, the implementation of a feed ban and beef
slaughtering standards, as well as the establishment of a BSE
surveillance system, according to Chen Lu-hung, head of the DOH's
Bureau of Food Sanitation.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the information made known so far shows that the
latest case involves an eight-year-old non-ambulatory "downer" cow,
but there has not been any other pathological data such as where
exactly the animal was raised and the whereabouts of its siblings.</P>
      <P>While the United States already imposed in 1997 a feed ban that
prohibits feeding to cattle and other ruminants most mammalian
protein, including meat-and-bone meal, it has also adopted beef
slaughtering standards that require the removal of risky
BSE-transmissible tissue such as brains, spinal cords and bones from
the cattle, Chen pointed out.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several members of the Consumers'
Foundation Saturday harshly criticized the Department of Health
(DOH) 's decision to reopen the Taiwan market to U.S. beef in
mid-April.</P>
      <P>The officials made the criticism after a second case of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, was confirmed in
the United States.</P>
      <P>Although the government reimposed the ban on imports of U.S.
beef from Saturday, it decided, following advice from experts in the
field, that U.S. beef already on store shelves in Taiwan is safe
and does not need to be removed.</P>
      <P>However, the Consumers' Foundation urged the government to recall
all U.S. beef already on store shelves "in consideration of local
consumers' health, " adding that it might mobilize consumers to
boycott U.S. beef if the government does not react to its call.</P>
      <P>Consumers' Foundation Vice Chairman Cheng Hung-jen said that
nobody is sure how long the incubation period of mad cow disease is
and he claimed that the lifting of the ban on imports of U.S. beef in
mid-April was made out of "political considerations."</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all related
products in December 2003 after the discovery in Washington State of
a single BSE case.</P>
      <P>The island lifted the ban on U.S. boneless beef from animals
under 30 months of age April 16.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the DOH decided to reopen the market despite
concern expressed by the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>After the second case of mad cow disease was confirmed, the DOH
still did not react quickly to demands that all U.S.
beef already on local store shelves be recalled, Cheng said,
claiming that the DOH's policy is "absurdly wrong" and saying that
the foundation will hold DOH officials responsible if any local
people are affected by the disease.</P>
      <P>The foundation's secretary-general, Huang Yi-teng, said that if
there are cases in which the health of local people is affected by
the disease, the foundation will help consumers claim compensation
from the government.</P>

      <P>Tu noted that the government has paid great attention to the
education problems faced by these new "sons of Taiwan " and he
stressed that allowing them to enjoy educational resources as
ordinary children in Taiwan is the responsibility of the government.</P>
      <P>In much the same way, Tu added, the government also has the
responsibility to allow children of Taiwanese businessmen living in
Southeast Asian countries to enjoy the same educational resources as
other Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-sheng, the Ministry of Education official in charge of
the education of overseas Taiwanese, noted that the issue needs to be
resolved via cooperation among various ministries.</P>
      <P>Liu suggested that the government allow the children to come back
to Taiwan for education or that they attend schools operated by
Taiwanese businessmen living abroad. He mentioned that there is one
such school in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City.</P>

An Italian judge has ordered the arrest of 13 officers and
operatives of the United States Central Intelligence Agency on
charges that they seized an Egyptian cleric on a Milan street two
years ago and flew him to Egypt for questioning, Italian prosecutors
and investigators said Friday. Judge Guido Salvini said in May that
it was "certain" that Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, had been seized by

    <HEADLINE>PUBLIC COMMUNICATION KEY TO SUCCESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Public communication is key to the success
of constitutitonal reforms, Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Yao said that the constitutional
reforms should be made in three steps: making the public aware of the
needs for the reforms through public communication; mapping out
strategies to be taken; and elaborating on the content of the
reforms.</P>
      <P>Yao revealed that he had suggested President Chen Shui-bian to
pay more attention to public communication recently when Chen invited
he himself, senior advisors to the president Peng Ming-min and Wu
Li-pei and former legislator Chang Chun-hsiung to discuss his bid to
promote a second phase of constitutional reforms.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Yao continued, Chen told them that a second
phase of constitutional reforms would address issues such as whether
to change the country's political system to a presidential system or
a parliamentary system; whether to change the existing five-branch
central government organization to a three-branch one; and whether
the Taiwan privincial government should be abolished.</P>
      <P>Yao said that he had no opinion on the content and timetable of
the reforms but suggesting the president pay more attention to
strategies, ways and means to be taken to promote constitutional
amendments.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to increase public communication to raise public
concern about the issue, Yao proposed.</P>
      <P>Addressing a symposium on sovereignty, constitution and the
future of Taiwan held by the Taiwan Law Society earlier in the day,
President Chen expressed confidence that he will give Taiwan a new
constitution that is timely, relevant and viable by the time he steps
down in 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LAWMAKERS GRILL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OVER BEEF IMPORT ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers from the opposition People First
Party (PFP) threatened Sunday to boycott the budget for the
Department of Health (DOH) should the top governmental health affairs
agency continue to be negligent in not overseeing safety of imported
beef from the United States.</P>
      <P>A second case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) , or mad
cow disease, in the United States was confirmed by a British
laboratory Friday, prompting the government to reimpose a ban on
imports of U.S. beef from Saturday.</P>
      <P>The DOH decided at the same time that U.S. beef already on store
shelves in Taiwan is safe and does not need to be removed.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation criticized the DOH harshly Saturday for
the department's decision to reopen the Taiwan market to U.S. beef in
mid-April despite concerns expressed by the Council of Agriculture
while Japan and South Korea did not do the same thing.</P>
      <P>Consumers' Foundation Vice Chairman Cheng Hung-jen also said that
after the second case of mad cow disease was confirmed, the DOH still
did not react quickly to demand that all U.S. beef already on local
store shelves be recalled. Claiming that the DOH's policy is
"absurdly wrong, " Cheng said that the foundation will hold DOH
officials responsible if any local people are affected by the
disease.</P>
      <P>In a press conference held at the Legislative Yuan Sunday, PFP
legislators Tsai Sheng-chia and Lin Teh-fu noted that nobody is sure
how long the incubation period of mad cow disease is and lashed out
at the DOH's lifting of the ban on imports of U.S. beef in mid-April
as a decision made out of "political considerations."</P>
      <P>Tsai questioned the DOH's motive and wisdom of reopening Taiwan's
doors to U.S. beef two months ago when Japan and South Korea were
keeping their bans in place.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DOH still decided to reopen Taiwan to U.S. beef
imports in April despite Council of Agriculture officials' concerns,
Tsai said that DOH officials should take the full responsibility now
that a second U.S. case of mad cow disease has been confirmed.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan consumers were to come down with mad cow disease after
eating imported U.S. beef, they should be entitled to national
compensation since this would be a repercussion caused by wrong
government policies, Tsai continued to say.</P>
      <P>Lin ridiculed the DOH officials for quoting U.S. beef exporters,
even liaison officials, as having guaranteed that U.S. beef is safe
despite that a second U.S. case of mad cow disease was still under
investigation, asking whether or not it was only a question of what
the Americans said.</P>
      <P>Chin Hui-chu, a PFP whip at the Legislative Yuan, claimed that
the Executive Yuan decided to reopen U.S. beef imports soon after
President Chen Shui-bian said that U.S. beef was safe and Taiwan
should re-introduce U.S. beef into the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Chin wanted a disclosure of the administration's decision-making
process concerning the beef reopening to find out who was the real
decision-maker.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all related
products in December 2003 after the discovery in Washington State of
a single BSE case, the first U.S. case of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The country lifted the ban on U.S. boneless beef from animals
under 30 months of age April 16.</P>

      <P>When PFP Chairman James Soong said on
Saturday night that he was physically fit to participate in the next
election, he was referring to the election of party chairman, not the
2008 presidential election, a People First Party (PFP) spokeswoman
clarified Sunday.</P>
      <P>Soong was at a banquet for the wedding of the son of PFP official
Lai Hung-min when he mentioned that he had just undergone a physical

    <HEADLINE>CBC LIKELY TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO AVERT LOOMING INFLATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The rising price of crude oil will force
the hand of Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC) to raise interest
rates soon to arrest market speculation about possible inflation,
analysts predict.</P>
      <P>The CBC is likely to raise interest rates by 0.125 percentage
points June 30 when its board of directors and supervisors meet for a
quarterly meeting, financial market sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to CBC authorities, the CBC has cut interest rates 15
consecutive times since December 2000, and only raised them by 0.25
percentage points in September 2004, followed by another rise again
last December of 0.125 percentage points and then again in March of
this year by 0.125 percentage points.</P>
      <P>Currently, the country's discount rate, guaranteed loan rate and
short-term loan rate stands at 1.875 percent, 2.25 percent and 4.125
percent, respectively, according to CBC authorities.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the possibility of raising interest rates, Kung
Ming-hsing, a senior researcher with the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research -- a think tank -- said that if domestic commodity prices
continue to soar as a result of spiraling oil prices, which surged
past the US$60 per barrel mark for the first time Thursday, the CBC
will have to do something to prevent inflation from jumping.</P>
      <P>The 0.125 percent rise in interest rates expected to be announced
June 30 could be the first of a series of similar rises in the future
should oil prices continued to surge, Kung speculated.</P>
      <P>Continuously rising interest rates, however, will probably deal a
blow to the domestic real estate market, which has gained steam in
recent months despite the fact that the country's economy has
suffered from sluggish growth since the first quarter of this year,
Kung pointed out.</P>
      <P>There have been two rival voices from within the CBC on the "to
raise or not to raise issue, " with one side hoping that the current
interest rates will remain unchanged because of the sluggish growth,
and the other side arguing that raising interest rates is unavoidable
amid looming inflation, a CBC official said.</P>
      <P>The local banker noted that reviewing past experiences, the CBC
tends to raise interest rates before inflation begins and it has
proved to be an effective method to maintain a healthy monetary
policy.</P>
      <P>As a result, he said, a rise of 0.125 percentage points in
Taiwan's interest rates on June 30 is very possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER CALLS FOR INTENSIFIED CRACKDOWN ON DRUG-RELATED CRIMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin said
Sunday law enforcement officers should do more to crack down on drug
trafficking and abuse because such offenses have been closely
associated with other criminal activities.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks while attending a "drug-free homeland"
activity organized by the Taipei Prosecutor's Office to mark the June
26 International Anti-Drug Day.</P>
      <P>In 2003 and 2004, Shih said, more than 8,400 kilograms of
contraband drugs were seized around the country. Worse still, he
said, 30-plus amphetamine producing facilities were discovered during
the same period, indicating that amphetamine production has gradually
been moved back to Taiwan from China.</P>
      <P>"Official tallies also show that the number of repeat drug
abusers and traffickers has been steadily rising, " Shih said, adding
that law enforcement agencies should strengthen cooperation in
cracking down on drug-related crimes.</P>
      <P>In addition, Shih said he is hopeful that community volunteers,
school teachers and administrators as well as media outlets can
launch a joint publicity campaign to help the public understand drug
hazards to human health, social order and even national security.</P>
      <P>Since many Taiwan drug dealers and traffickers are believed to be
hiding in China, Shih urged Beijing to intensify investigations into
its domestic drug trade and cooperate with Taiwan to thwart drug
trafficking across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"China should forsake its political ideology and cooperate with
Taiwan to stamp out drug-related crime for the sake of protecting
public health and social order," he added.</P>
      <P>Shih's appeal for reinforced crackdown on drug crime
came two days after President Chen Shui-bian said drug
abuse is not just a personal moral issue but has become an issue
crucial to public order, social stability, public health and national
security.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with individual volunteers and social groups
that have made outstanding contributions to the anti-drug campaign
over the past year, Chen said many criminal cases now are related to
drugs.</P>
      <P>"With drug abuse becoming ever more serious, new ecstasy pills
continuing to appear and the number of repeat drug abusers and
traffickers rising steadily, drug-related crime has become rampant,"
Chen said, adding that drug abuse has also become a major cause
behind afast rise in the number of local HIV carriers.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said he hopes individual volunteers
and public interest groups can continue their efforts in assisting
the government in eradicating drug trafficking and abuse and in
curbing a further spread of AIDS.</P>

      <P>A civic group led by opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) lawmaker Her Jyh-huei urged the government Sunday to allow it
to act as a platform between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to
help Taiwan farmers sell their produce in China.</P>
      <P>Her, who serves as chairman of the Association for Economic and
Trade Relations Across the Strait (AETRAS) , said that the group is
prepared to act as a private-sector communications bridge to step up
two-way business and cultural exchanges since systematic talks
between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and China's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait have been cut since mid-1999.</P>
      <P>To help Taiwan farmers capture a larger portion of the Chinese
market, the group is planning to kick off a series of agricultural
exchanges in the near term, such as a Taiwan Week being held in

government is willing to grant its approval, the AETRAS is very
willing to serve as a civilian platform between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Although China offered greater market access to Taiwan farm
exports to visiting KMT Chairman Lien Chan during a trip from April
26 to May 3, Her pointed out that no progress has been made in this
regard and called on the government to come up with a resolution as
quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>China promised to provide duty-free treatment to 15 categories of
Taiwan fruits and to allow the import of 18 categories of quarantined
farm products during Lien's visit in a goodwill gesture to improve
its strained relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, China has so far been reluctant to talk over technical
details regarding the opening with the semiofficial Taiwan External
Trade Development Council appointed by the Republic of China
government, making it harder for Taiwan farmers to provide quarantine
and product origin certifications, he said, adding that all these
problems need to be handled by the government.</P>
      <P>At present, farm produce from Taiwan must go through a third area
or country, such as Hong Kong, to be quarantined and certified, he
explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-JAPAN FISHING DISPUTES SHOULD BE SOLVED DIPLOMATICALLY: YAO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-Japan fishing disputes should be
settled diplomatically via rational bilateral negotiations,
Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen, an expert in South China Sea
issues, said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Yao said that the last thing he would like to see is that Taiwan
comes into conflict with Japan as the result of fishing disputes
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>As the 15th round of fishery talks between Taiwan and Japan is
scheduled to be held in Tokyo July 29, mainly aimed at solving the
disputes caused by overlapping economic zones, Yao said that the
country could use some debates on whether the sovereignty issue
should be delinked from the fishing rights issue during the
forthcoming fishery meeting to make the talks more pragmatic.</P>
      <P>Yao made the remarks after a Taiwan fishing boat, the
"Chinruifeng No. 168, " reportedly was given notice by a Japanese
patrol boat Sunday "to leave the Japanese exclusive economic zone" at
an area near the "temporary demarcation line" that has been zoned
tacitly between the two countries regarding fishing operations.</P>
      <P>The Suao Fishermen's Association complained the same day that
since Taiwan and Japan are preparing to meet for a new round of
fishery talks to address the overlapped economic zones issue, Japan
should not take radical moves now to declare its sovereignty over the
area that is Taiwan fishermen's traditional fishing grounds and is
zoned clearly by the "temporary demarcation line."</P>
      <P>Yao did not advocate the ROC Navy sending military vessels to
"protect the interests of fishermen, " saying that if fishing
disputes arise because of unclear economic zones, the disputes should
be tackled via diplomatic means.</P>
      <P>As to the territorial disputes involving the Tiaoyutai Islands,
known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan, to which Taiwan, Japan and
China claim sovereignty, Yao said that as far as he knew, China has
been using a "syllogism" strategy, claiming that the Tiaoyutai
Islands belongs to Taiwan and since Taiwan is part of China, the
Tiaoyutai Islands are China's.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S NEW REGULATIONS ON RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS MEAN STRICT CONTROL: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's new Regulations on Religious
Affairs have done more in strengthening Beijing's control and
governance of religions than safeguarding the people's religious
freedom, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of the Executive Yuan
said in a newly released report.</P>
      <P>The research report for June, written by the cultural division of
the MAC, noted that although the regulations, which came into effect
in March, reaffirm that all Chinese citizens enjoy freedom of
religious belief, they may actually still impose many restrictions on
religious faiths, making these standards of freedom quite different
from those in democratic countries.</P>
      <P>The report said it is clear from the new regulations that
religious affairs in China are not ruled by law, but are still ruled
by government officials. For example, Article 3 says the state
protects "normal religious activities." Yet the legal definition of
"normal" is never clearly defined, and the government has the right
to interpret it freely.</P>
      <P>In another example, Article 3 and Article 4 emphasize that all
religious groups and activities must be in line with national unity,
consolidation among different ethnic groups and social stability, and
free from foreign control. This means that religions are still
subject to the highest guiding principles of the Communist Party of
China.</P>
      <P>The report further noted that, according to the regulations,
people in China can believe in any religion, but are not allowed to
preach freely. Religious workers are not allowed to preach outside
their places registered with the government, and they can only preach
in designated time periods.</P>
      <P>The Appendix of the regulations says China will undertake
religious exchanges with Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau in accordance
with laws, administrative regulations and relevant rules of the
nation. The MAC report viewed this as largely ambiguous and wants to
wait and see what might develop from it.</P>
      <P>The regulations, announced by China's State Council, took six
years to draft. They cover six areas: general principles of religious
freedom, expectations of religious organizations, places of worship,
specifics for religious personnel, issues concerning religious
property and legal liabilities. Altogether there are 48 articles.</P>
      <P>Religious leaders worldwide have noted that the Chinese
government, officially atheist, cares less about what religious
people actually believe than about its official policies not being
undermined. Many observers have agreed that the success of the
regulations will depend on how they are interpreted and implemented
at the grassroots level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSUMERS' FOUNDATION WANTS U. S. BEEF TO BE DESTROYED PUBLICLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Out of concern that public fears over U. S.
beef might flare again in Taiwan following a second confirmation of
mad cow disease in the United States, the Consumers' Foundation (CF)
demanded the government Sunday publicly destroy all U. S. beef that
has been imported to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CF Vice Chairman Chen Hung-jen, who visited various hypermarkets
earlier the same day, said that his foundation can help retailers ask
for compensation from the Department of Health (DOH) if they are
willing to take these products off the shelves.</P>
      <P>The DOH immediately reimposed a ban on U. S. beef imports
Saturday after a second mad cow disease case in the United States was
confirmed. The DOH removed the restriction in April this year
following a 14-month ban after the first case in the United States
was reported in late 2003.</P>
      <P>CF Secretary General-Huang Yi-teng said that the government must
fully assume responsibility for the two-month legal loophole that it
created and insisted that the government should come up with specific
measures to deal with risky beef from the United States by asking
retailers to recall their products and compensate them for their
losses for the sake of public health.</P>
      <P>The government must respond to the U. S. beef in question because
it is very difficult for the general public to trace the origin of
the meat they eat if they were said to be from other countries, he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local hypermarket managers said that the sale of U. S.
beef in their shops have not been affected despite the news of a
second mad cow disease case in the United States, a sharp contrast to
a general assumption that U. S. beef will be rejected by Taiwan
consumers.</P>
      <P>However, the managers said that they will replace U. S. beef with
beef from Australia and New Zealand after the current stock from the
United States is used up in late July at the earliest.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that they will increase supplies of Australian
and New Zealand beef in the near future given that Taiwan consumers
have been gradually getting used to products from the two countries
over the past two years.</P>
      <P>Before the first mad cow disease case in the United States, U. S.
beef enjoyed about a 70 precent share in the domestic market, well
ahead of some 30 percent taken by beef from Australia and New
Zealand, they said, adding, however, that the ratio had dropped to
around 50 percent after the initial ban.</P>
      <P>They predicted that the follow-up effects in the domestic market
will not surface until next week despite the fact that the Taiwan
market remains little affected for the time being.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN COAST GUARD URGES JAPAN TO EXERCISE SELF-RESTRAINT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both Taiwan and Japan should exercise
self-restraint before the two countries work out a solution to their
fishing rights dispute through negotiations, the Coast Guard
Administration (CGA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The CGA made the call after a Japanese coast guard ship issued a
warning to a Taiwan fishing boat operating near the middle line of
the two countries' overlapping economic waters, also known locally as
the "tentative demarcation line," earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>The "Chinjuifeng No. 168" from Suao in the northeastern county of
Ilan was operating in waters some 60 nautical miles east of the
Tiaoyutai Islands -- a group of uninhabited islets in the East China
Sea claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China -- when it was served a
Japanese notice asking it to leave the region.</P>
      <P>CGA officials said that as the Chinjuifeng was operating within
the "tentative demarcation line" that has been zoned tacitly between
the two countries regarding fishing operations, the CGA immediately
ordered its "Keelung" patrol vessel to sail to the disputed region to
protect the Taiwan fishing boat's safety.</P>
      <P>The "Keelung" patrol vessel was on a North Pacific patrol mission
at the time. In addition, the CGA sent two other ships from Taiwan to
the region.</P>
      <P>According to CGA officials, the three patrol ships have arrived
at the disputed waters by Sunday evening. The officials said the CGA
will do its utmost to protect local fishermen's safety.</P>
      <P>The officials said the CGA has also informed the Ministry of
National Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Fishery
Administration under the council of Agriculture of the latest
incident and asked for their assistance in dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>Since the two countries have agreed to hold a new round of talks
to resolve their fishing rights dispute in Tokyo July 29, the CGA
officials said they hope Japan can exercise self-restraint to avoid
complicating the issue.</P>
      <P>The incident came after the Ministry of National Defense, under
strong pressure from opposition lawmakers, sent a Knox-class frigate
to patrol the disputed waters Tuesday to accentuate Taiwan's
determination to protect its fishermen's rights and safety. Some 15
lawmakers from across the party spectrum, led by Legislative Yuan
speaker Wang Jin-pyng, took the cruise aboard the warship in the
company of Defense Minister Lee Jye.</P>
      <P>At the heart of the dispute is the two countries' sovereignty
claim to the Tiaoyutai Islands. Both Tokyo and Taipei claim that the
island group falls within their 200-mile exclusive economic zones.
Japan often fines ship owners and impounds Taiwanese fishing vessels
that enter waters close to the Tiaoyutais.</P>
      <P>The previous 14 rounds of Taiwan-Japanese fishery talks did not
make significant headway because Taiwan would not forsake its
sovereignty claim to the Tiaoyutais which Japan has held since 1971.</P>
      <P>The dispute came into the limelight again recently after some 50
Taiwan fishing boats staged a rare protest in the disputed waters
over Japanese coast guard ships' frequently chasing them away from
the region.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for the Suao Fishermen's Association said Japan
should refrain from sending coast guard ships to patrol waters close
to the "tentative demarcation line" now that the two countries will
meet in July to discuss measures for joint exploration for and
management of resources in their overlapping economic waters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. BEEF ON LOCAL STORE SHELVES PERFECTLY SAFE: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. beef on local store shelves and on way
to Taiwan is perfectly safe, a Department of Health (DOH) official
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Lu-hung, director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation,
said the government's decision to reinstate a U.S. beef import ban
the previous day was more of "procedural" in nature rather than out
of food safety concern.</P>
      <P>"When the DOH lifted the ban on imports of U.S. boneless beef
from animals under 30 months of age April 16 this year, it made a
promise that the door will be shut down again if a new case of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease is confirmed in
the United States," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first banned U.S. beef imports in December 2003 after the
United States reported its first case of BSE, which has been linked
to a variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, a disease that
has claimed more than 140 lives worldwide, mostly in Britain.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Premier Frank Hsieh ordered a reinstatement of the
U.S. beef import ban after the U.S. Department of Agriculture
confirmed the discovery of a second BSE case. Nevertheless, the DOH
said U.S. beef on local market shelves and delivered before June 25
can still be sold here.</P>
      <P>The decision immediately drew scathing criticism from consumers
groups and some opposition lawmakers. They demanded that the
government recall all U.S. beef from local market shelves and destroy
the produce in public for health concern.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said the newly discovered BSE case involved an
eight-year-old non-ambulatory "downer" cow which had never entered
the market nor been made into animal feeds.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said, the U.S. beef allowed to enter Taiwan in the
past two months was from young cattle under 30 months of age which is
free of any risk of BSE infection. Therefore, he said, the DOH will
not ask stores to remove U.S. beef from their shelves.</P>
      <P>As to when the government would lift the import ban again, Chen
said the issue will be considered only after certain conditions are
met.</P>
      <P>"The conditions that the United States must meet will include the
release of pathological information concerning the second BSE case,
the birth certificate of the sick cattle, the implementation of a
feed ban and beef slaughtering standards, as well as the
establishment of a BSE surveillance system," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the information made known so far shows that the
latest case involves an eight-year-old non-ambulatory "downer" cow,
but there has not been any other pathological data such as where
exactly the animal was raised and the whereabouts of its siblings.</P>
      <P>While the United States already imposed in 1997 a feed ban that
prohibits feeding to cattle and other ruminants most mammalian
protein, including meat-and-bone meal, it has also adopted beef
slaughtering standards that require the removal of risky
BSE-transmissible tissue such as brains, spinal cords and bones from
the cattle, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is also reviewing
its BSE surveillance program, Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must craft comprehensive
complementary measures no matter which government system it would
adopt in the future, a scholar in constitutional theory and
principles said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-hsi, president of the Ketagalan Institute and a mentor
of President Chen Shui-bian, made the remarks while delivering in a
speech in the eastern city of Hualien on the pursuit of an ideal
constitutional system for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Describing the present ROC Constitution as a Draconian statute,
Lee said the government system laid out in the Constitution is
cobbled together from various political systems. As a result, he
said, the system set forth in the present Constitution is hard to
implement.</P>
      <P>In the next stage of constitutional reform, Lee said, Taiwan
should flesh out all-inclusive complementary measures once it make a
final decision on its future government system.</P>
      <P>"There has been a debate in local society on whether Taiwan
should adopt a presidential system or a parliamentary system. Either
of them has its own special features, merits and deficiencies. No
matter which system we may choose in the future, the most important
thing is that we should draw up complementary measures to make our
new system viable and fitting to our national situation," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks came a day after President Chen reaffirmed his
commitment to acting as a "midwife" who will help with the delivery
of a new Constitution for Taiwan by the time he steps down in 2008.</P>
      <P>The Ketagalan Institute is an independent, non-partisan
educational institution founded by President Chen in March 2003 for
promoting civic values through policy research.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LAWMAKERS GRILL ADMINISTRATION OVER U.S. BEEF IMPORT ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of opposition legislators grilled
the administration again Monday over the U.S. beef imports issue amid
concerns of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lai Shyh-bao, a deputy convener of
the KMT caucus at the Legislative Yuan, said he wants administration
officials, including Premier Frank Hsieh, to apologize to the country
for "wrong policies" which he claimed have ignored the people's
health and compromised Taiwan's national dignity.</P>
      <P>A second case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) , or mad
cow disease, in the United States was confirmed by a British
laboratory Friday, prompting the government to reimpose a ban on
imports of U.S. beef from Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) decided at the same time that U.S.
beef already on store shelves in Taiwan is safe and does not need to
be removed.</P>
      <P>Lai criticized the government for putting political
considerations ahead the people's health. He said that beef from the
ROC-held outlying island of Kinmen has been banned from being
imported into Taiwan proper since 1999 following a foot-and-mouth
disease outbreak there. The ban still stands today even though no new
cases of foot-and-mouth disease have been reported since then, he
said.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker ridiculed the administration for "flattering" the
United States by reopening Taiwan's doors to U.S. beef even though
the mad cow disease threat in the United States has not disappeared
as evidenced by Friday's confirmation of a second case.</P>
      <P>Lai said that companies which have sustained losses due to the
government's wrong policies regarding U.S. beef imports should be
entitled to national compensation, adding that if anyone comes down
with mad cow disease after ingesting imported U.S. beef, the
government should foot their medical bills in addition to paying them
compensation.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Joanna Lei urged the administration to end its
"beef diplomacy" and refrain from "trading people's lives for
Taiwan's diplomatic space."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition People First Party (PFP) Lin Teh-fu said
that the administration owes the country explanations on many
matters, including why Taiwan reopened its doors to U.S. beef in
April despite concerns expressed by the Council of Agriculture and
why imported U.S. beef is allowed to remain on store shelves around
Taiwan after the DOH called a halt to imports of U.S. beef Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that nobody is sure how long the incubation period of
mad cow disease is and lashed out at the DOH's lifting of the ban on
imports of U.S. beef in mid-April as a decision made out of
"political considerations."</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lee Hung-chun asked why Taiwan reopened its doors
to U.S. beef in April while more than 50 countries around the world,
including Japan and South Korea, kept their bans on U.S. beef imports
in place.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmakers threatened Sunday to block the budget for the
Department of Health should the top government health affairs agency
continue to be negligent in overseeing safety of imported beef from
the United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all related
products in December 2003 after the discovery in Washington State of
a single BSE case, the first U.S. case of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The country lifted the ban on U.S. boneless beef from animals
under 30 months of age April 16.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAN ON POULTRY IMPORTS FROM JAPAN REMAINS IN FORCE: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ban on poultry imports from Japan has
remained in force since January 2004, a Council of Agriculture
official in charge of animal quarantine and inspection affairs said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks after the Japanese government
announced over the weekend that bird flu has been detected in
chickens at a farm in northeastern Japan and that restrictions have
been imposed on shipments of poultry and eggs from the area.</P>
      <P>"We have imposed a ban on imports of poultry and related products
from Japan since the H5N1 bird flu infections were confirmed in that
country in January 2004, " the official said, adding that the ban has
not been lifted since that time.</P>
      <P>Amid reports of new bird flu infections in Japan, the official
said, the COA will heighten its alert and step up inspection and
quarantine measures to avert any avian flu-infected poultry from
entering Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government said Sunday that more than 800 chickens
at a farm in Mitsukaido City in Ibaraki Prefecture, located just
northeast of Tokyo, have died since April, and recent tests on some
found they were infected with the H5N2 strain of bird flu.</P>
      <P>H5N2 is regarded as less dangerous strain of the bird flu virus
than H5N1, which has led to the death and slaughter of tens of
millions of birds across Asia since late 2003. H5N1 has also crossed
over to humans, killing 38 people in Vietnam, 12 in Thailand and four
in Cambodia in the past couple of years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN CALLS FOR BLOOD DONATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called for people
Monday not to be reluctant to donate blood, especially in the summer
when a lack of blood is expected because the regular blood donation
operations in schools will be stopped during summer vacation.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal while receiving over 30 acclaimed blood
donors at the Presidential Office. Each of the donors have donated
blood more than 140 times, while one of the five female donors among
the remarkable citizens, Jao Chiu-yun, has donated blood 506 times.</P>
      <P>The president expressed his admiration and gratitude to the
donors for their "life-saving deed, " saying that generously donating
blood for needy people is a "valuable life-caring action."</P>
      <P>After 31 years of efforts to promote a blood-donation campaign
around the country, Taiwan has seen success, with the
"donation-supply balance" reaching 7.9 percent, well above the
internationally recognized standard of 5 percent, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Last year, a total of 2.33 million units of blood was donated
nationwide, for a total of 5.3 million units for use in medical
treatment following processing of the donated blood.</P>
      <P>More remarkably, Chen noted, since 1991, 100 percent of Taiwan's
domestic supply of blood for medical treatment has come from
voluntary donors.</P>
      <P>However, he reminded people that blood donation operations have
been affected by the mid-June floods caused by torrential rains in
southern Taiwan, and that the major source of blood donations --
schools around the country -- will soon close for summer vacation.</P>
      <P>To ensure sufficient blood supplies during the long summer
vacation, Chen urged people to answer his call to donate blood.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Department of Health Hou Sheng-mao and Taiwan
Blood Donation Foundation Chairman Lin Kuo-hsin were also at the
meeting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui exhorted a
group of excellent aboriginal students Monday to return to their home
villages after graduation to help lift the development of aboriginal
communities.</P>
      <P>Lee, one of the key donors to the Aboriginal Scholarship
established by the Lee Lien Educational Foundation, conferred
scholarships on aboriginal students who were selected by the
foundation this year. The scholarships total NT$1.02 million
(US$32,903).</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony held at National Taipei Teachers'
College, Lee said he wants the aboriginal student elite to return to
their home towns after graduation to serve or teach there, taking up
their historical responsibilities by playing roles as "enlighteners."</P>
      <P>Noting that most of the country's aboriginal villages suffer not
only from poor living conditions but also from a lack of confidence
spiritually, Lee exhorted the aboriginal top-scorers to help boost
the indigenous people's psychological rehabilitation and in turn
rebuild their confidence in themselves.</P>
      <P>Development of aboriginal society will be accelerated only when
environments there are noticeably improved and the people regain
their confidence in themselves, Lee reiterated.</P>
      <P>A total of 80 indigenous students received the 2005 Aboriginal
Scholarship, the third of its kind, with scholarship amounts ranging
from NT$20,000 (for graduate students) , to NT$15,000 (for college
students) and NT$10,000 (for senior high school and vocational school
students).</P>
      <P>According to Huang Kun-hui, chairman of the Lee Lien Educational
Foundation, President Lee donated all of the governmental subsidies
from campaign funds to enable the establishment of the foundation in
1996 after Lee won Taiwan's first popular presidential election.</P>
      <P>With savings interest rates continuing to fall in recent years,
Huang said, the foundation has found it increasingly difficult to
maintain the same levels of scholarship amounts every year. He urged
all sectors of the country to contribute to this great project aimed
at helping aboriginal young men and women.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U. S. liaison officials stationed in Taiwan
gave their assurances Monday of the safety of beef imports from the
United States to Taiwan and called on Taiwan to reopen its market to
U. S. imports based on scientific review, not politics.</P>
      <P>Dana Shell Smith, spokeswoman for the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) , and Eric Trachtenberg, AIT deputy section chief in
charge of farm trade, made the remarks while answering questions from
reporters during a meeting with local media.</P>
      <P>Stressing that U. S. beef imported to Taiwan is completely safe
despite the fact that a second case of BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) , or mad cow disease, in the United States was
confirmed over the weekend, Trachtenberg urged Taiwan authorities to
use its scientific c judgment, not politics, to decide whether U. S.
beef should continue to be imported into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) immediately
reimposed a ban on beef imports from the United States Saturday, only
two months after it lifted a ban in April. Taiwan initially put the
ban in place in late 2003 soon after the first case of mad cow
disease was discovered.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation has asked the DOH to publicly destroy
all U. S. beef sold to Taiwan, which would include that on shelves
and in storage out of grave concern over public health.</P>
      <P>According to Trachtenberg, the second case of BSE is not a new
case, or a new animal, but a re-test of an old sample taken during an
extensive cattle herd surveillance program before Dec. 2004.</P>
      <P>Citing the newest guidelines published by the World Animal Health
Organization May 27, Trachtenberg said that boneless beef from cattle
under 30 months can be freely traded without risk to consumers
regardless of the exporting country's BSE status, provided that the
animals are inspected before and after slaughter, specified risk
materials are removed, and approved slaughter methods are used, he
noted.</P>
      <P>The United States follows all of these guidelines for beef sold
to Taiwan, he said, emphasizing that there are major differences in
the cow whose test just came back and the cattle used in U. S. beef
exports. This cow was born before the U. S. government put into place
stringent new measures, including the prohibition of feeding rendered
cattle products back to other cattle.</P>
      <P>In addition to being born before the feed ban, the animal in
question did not and never would have entered the food supply or feed
supply chain, he explained, noting that Taiwan's decision to reopen
its market to U. S. beef April 16 was based on a thorough, objective
and scientific review of safety over 15 months, involving 18 outside
experts.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's decision to resume U. S. beef imports in April was made
without political considerations, Smith said.</P>
      <P>AIT is responsible for Washington's dealings with Taiwan now that
the two countries maintain no formal diplomatic ties.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fishing rights are an extension of
sovereignty and the sovereignty issue is by no means a matter
concerning only fishermen, according to a group of Taiwan academics
Monday.</P>
      <P>They called for the administration to harden its resolve to
protect the country's fishermen by seriously reiterating the Republic
of China on Taiwan's sovereignty claim over the Tiaoyutai Islands --
the heart of fishing disputes between Taiwan and Japan, which have
been brought into the limelight recently.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan, Prof. Kuo
Chung-yi with Soochow University said that because Japan claims the
Tiaoyutai Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan, the
Japanese government has demarcated its 200-nautical mile exclusive
economic zone to an area reaching Taiwan's doorstep, leading to the
recurrence of a spate of fishing disputes between the two countries
in recent years.</P>
      <P>Prof. Liu Yuan-chun, a former president of Soochow University,
expressed indignation with the administration's recent announcement,
prior to the 15th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks, that
discussions on fishing rights would have nothing to do with the
sovereignty issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that fishing rights are absolutely an extension of
sovereignty, Liu lashed out at the administration, calling it "a
bunch of irresponsible liars" who say that the issue of sovereignty
over the Tiaoyutais will not be brought up at the forthcoming
Taiwan-Japan fishery talks.</P>
      <P>Prof. Hsia Chu-chiu with National Taiwan University noted that
Japan does not have fishing disputes with Taiwan alone. Japan has had
similar disputes with South Korea over the island chain of Takashima,
known as "Dokdo" in South Korea. Because the South Korean government
firmly supported private actions to defend the disputed island chain,
Japan did not make headway with their claim over the islands, Hsia
added.</P>
      <P>The three professors said that they already have acquired
signatures of nearly 50 academics and intellectuals in the country,
including Academia Sinica Vice President Ovid Tzeng, supporting the
launch of a campaign called the "global Chinese intellectuals
protecting Taiwan fishermen" in the hopes that more intellectuals and
people with greater influence will exert pressure on the government
so that Taiwan will not lose ground in the upcoming fishery talks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. ENVOY REASSURES SAFETY OF BEEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The de facto U.S. ambassador to Taipei
reassured Taiwan consumers of the safety of U.S. beef Monday.</P>
      <P>Douglas Paal, director of the American Institute in Taiwan's
Taipei Office, made the remarks following Taiwan's reimposition of a
ban on imports of U.S. beef Saturday, one day after a second case of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, in the
United States was confirmed by a British laboratory.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) decided at the same time that U.S.
beef already on store shelves in Taiwan is safe and does not need to
be removed.</P>
      <P>Paal said that the second case of BSE is not a new case, or a new
animal, but a re-test of an old sample taken during an extensive
cattle herd surveillance program before December 2004.</P>
      <P>"There is no reason to question the safety of the U.S. beef
supply. This cow never entered the food supply or feed supply chain,"
Paal said. In fact, because the animal was older than 30 months of
age when slaughtered, the stringent screening measures now in place
would never allow such an animal to be utilized for food or feed, he
added.</P>
      <P>He said that there is no reason "to compare this long-deceased
cow with cattle that are now being used for U.S. beef exports."</P>
      <P>He also said that the stringent screening measures in place to
protect consumers and contain the spread of BSE succeeded in
identifying, isolating and disposing of this disease animal.</P>
      <P>The recently confirmed BSE case has no public or animal health
implications, he maintained, adding that "this test has absolutely no
bearing on U.S. beef imported to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that Taiwan will move swiftly to re-open
the beef market after AIT shares detailed information on the recent
BSE detection.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all related
products in December 2003 after the discovery in Washington State of
a single BSE case, the first U.S. case of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The country lifted the ban on U.S. boneless beef from animals
under 30 months of age April 16.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased US$325 million-worth of U.S. beef and beef
products in 2003 and was the sixth-largest importer of U.S. beef
before Taiwan imposed the ban. Since then, Australian and New Zealand
beef has replaced U.S. beef in the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>More than 40 countries, including Japan, the largest importer,
banned U.S. beef in the aftermath of the mad cow disease scare,
seriously affecting the U.S. beef export trade, which is worth at
least US$3.8 billion a year.

Wall Street Journal: After Earlier Fumbles, Cn ooc Uses Wall

Six years ago, the state-owned Chinese oil company Cnooc Ltd.

the result was utter failure due to poor timing and a lack of
interest by investors. Six years la ter, Cnooc is trying to make
itself understood again -- and the world is paying attention this
time. The oil and natural-gas producer is pursuing the biggest
overseas acquisition in Chinese history: an $18.5 billion rival bid
against Chevron Corp. for control of California-based Unocal Corp.

    <HEADLINE>CHIOU'S U.S. VISIT IRRELEVANT TO ARMS PROCUREMENT PROJECT: ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  June  26 (CNA)
(By Lu-sheng Chu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The top ROC representative to the
United States confirmed Sunday that Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of
Taiwan's National Security Council, is currently on a visit in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, David Ta-wei Lee said he doesn't think that Chiou's
ongoing U.S. visit has anything to do with issues related to Taiwan's
long-stalled arms procurement project.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports, Chiou arrived at Los Angeles
International Airport Friday evening. He was escorted from the
airport by an unidentified American upon his arrival. Since then, no
local journalists have been able to trace his whereabouts. </P>
      <P>Lee, who came to Los Angeles from Washington, D.C. over the
weekend to address a meeting of executives of major Taiwanese
expatriate associations in southern California, told Chinese-language
media correspondents during a news briefing Sunday that Chiou would
have traveled to Washington, D.C. first if he were to discuss the
arms procurement project during his current visit.</P>
      <P>"Chiou would also have contacted me if the main purpose of his
visit were to tackle the arms procurement project as some media
reports speculated," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The United States agreed to sell Taiwan a robust package of
weapons in 2001. While Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party
administration has come up with a special budget proposal for the
procurement package, its opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has
so far not approved the bill.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ROC government's stance on arms procurement has been
very consistent. In his view, Lee said, the pending procurement
project forms an extremely important part of Taiwan-U.S. military
cooperation.</P>
      <P>"It is my hope that our legislature can pass the budget bill for
the procurement project as soon as possible," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The NT$480 billion arms procurement package includes eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT$205 MILLION TO BE SPENT IN PROMOTING LANYU COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will spend US$205 million
(US$6.54 million) in efforts to rebuild six tribal communities on
Orchid Island, or Lanyu, an offshore island which lies off the
southeastern coast of Taiwan, Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday.</P>
      <P>The money was donated by Taiwan Power Company in return for Lanyu
serving as a dumping ground for nuclear waste produced by
nuclear-generated power plants on the main island of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the announcement while attending the Lanyu Flying Fish
Festival's opening. Ministers without Portfolio Fu Li-yeh, Kuo
Yao-chi and Cho Jung-tai; Walis Pelin, minister of the Council of
Indigenous Peoples; and Taitung County Magistrate Hsu Chin-yuan were
also at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>A planned overall community rebuilding program will be
implemented under goals including promoting industrial development,
upgrading social welfare and medical treatment systems, improving
community security, promoting cultural education, and preserving the
natural environment of the small island, home of the indigenous tribe
of Tao, or Yamei, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Besides the program, a limited ban on commercial fishing within
six nautical miles off the coast of Lanyu will also be implemented
from March to June every year to preserve marine sources -- mainly
flying fish -- for the island people, Hsieh noted</P>
      <P>The three-month period is the Tao's traditional fishing season
for flying fish, which is the source of the indigenous people's diet
and cultural development.</P>
      <P>From next year, fishing boats with a displacement of over 10 tons
will not be allowed to fish in the area, while drift nets, explosive
and toxic substance are prohibited.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a suspended employment project will also be resumed to

    <TEXT>
      <P>: Independent Legislator Li Ao, a noted
writer who is also known for having filed numerous lawsuits in the
past four decades, is setting a new national record by suing all his
colleagues in the Legislative Yuan -- 224 of them in all -- for
"abusing their rights" and "failure to perform their duties."</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court will begin hearing the case July 1.</P>
      <P>Li reportedly told his friends that he enjoys suing people and is
not afraid of incurring the anger of his fellow legislators.
He said he was "proud" of his new record.</P>
      <P>What prompted Li to file the suit was the resolution adopted by
the Legislative Yuan March 4 in reaction to the anti-secession law
being considered at that time by the National People's Congress,
Beijing's rubber-stamp parliament.</P>
      <P>The resolution says the Republic of China, since its founding in
1912, has been a "sovereign, independent country" and that any move
to unilaterally change the status quo or try to denigrate the
sovereignty of the nation will run counter to the common will of the
Taiwan people and the international community.</P>
      <P>Li claimed that in adopting the resolution, the lawmakers acted
beyond their power and in violation of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that despite being a member of the Legislative
Yuan, he was never consulted during the process of drawing up the
resolution, while his colleagues claimed that the resolution was
passed following party negotiations and represented Taiwan public
opinion.</P>
      <P>Believing that his rights have been violated, Li is demanding
that the court rule that each of his 224 colleagues should pay him
NT$1 (about US$0.03) in compensation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. BEEF ALREADY IN TAIWAN SAFE, NO NEED FOR RECALL: HEALTH DEPT.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> Taipei, June 27 (CAN) U.S. beef is safe and there is no need to
take it off the market or mark it with a warning, an official of the
Department of Health (DOH) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Lu-hung, director of DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation, made
the remarks at a news conference following Taiwan's reimposition of a
ban on imports of U.S. beef Saturday, one day after a second case of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, in the
United States was confirmed by a British laboratory.</P>
      <P>Grilled by media over whether the decision was politically
motivated -- the previous ban was just lifted two months ago -- and
whether Taiwan has followed strict screening procedures in importing
U.S. beef, Chen stressed that the DOH's policy is based on
professional considerations, and there has been no political
pressure.</P>
      <P>He said that mad cow disease is caused by feed containing an
abnormal form of a protein called prion, and that the U.S. imposed a
ban on such feed in 1997. The World Organization for Animal Health
said trade of U.S. boneless beef for cattle 30 months of age or under
can be allowed regardless of any other considerations.</P>
      <P>Addressing some legislators' concerns that Japan has not reopened
its markets to U.S. beef imports, while Taiwan has, Chen said that
when Taiwan decided to lift the U.S. beef ban in April, there was a
condition; namely, that if a subsequent case surfaced, U.S. beef
imports would be immediately suspended. Given this second case, the
DOH banned U.S. beef; however, the meat that is currently in Taiwan
is safe, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all related
products in December 2003 after the discovery in Washington State of
a single BSE case, the first U.S. case of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Taiwan lifted the ban on U.S. boneless beef from animals under 30

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu arrived in Palau
Monday for a three-day official visit.</P>
      <P>Lu was warmly welcomed by Minister of State Affairs Temmy L.
Shumull and Taiwanese expatriates in the Pacific island nation at the
Palau international airport.</P>
      <P>Soon after her arrival, Lu called on President Tommy Remengesau

      <P>In their 20-minute talks, Lu and Remengesau expressed commitment
to boosting friendly relations between Taiwan and Palau. Lu later

      <P>Palau, famous for its coral reefs, attracts many tourists from
around the world every year. Accompanied by local people, Lu made a
sightseeing cruise by boat to a coral reef preservation area and
other tourist attractions later in the day.</P>
      <P>Referring to Palau's well-developed tourist industry, Lu said as
an island surrounded by sea like Palau, Taiwan should make more
efforts to promote oceanic tourism on its offshore islets such as
Penghu and Green Island.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of Lu's visit was to meet with Palauan officials
in charge of tourism and with local hoteliers to gain a better

    <TEXT>
      <P>Democracy and freedom are the
cornerstones of Taiwan-U. S. relations, upon which both countries are
in the best position to build mutually beneficial ties, Republic of
China's top envoy to the United States David Ta-wei Lee said Sunday
in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Giving a 30-minute speech at a dinner party with more than 200
local Chinese community representatives, Lee said that Taiwan's
democracy and freedom have made the country's existence so important
that this cannot be underestimated by the American people, both those
friendly to Taiwan and those who are not.</P>
      <P>In turn, the lack of democracy and freedom in China is the
leading barrier for the Beijing regime in terms of developing ties
with the United States.</P>
      <P>He noted that U.S. President George W. Bush mentioned democracy
and freedom 27 times when giving his second inaugural speech in
January this year.</P>
      <P>According to the de facto ambassador from Taiwan to the United
States, Taiwan- U. S. relations reached a high-point in April 2001.
Bilateral links began to improve again this spring after Beijing came
up with an Anti-Secession Law in mid-March to contain Taiwan
independence, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's rational and peaceful response toward the Anti-Secession
Law has again brought Taiwan and the United States closer thanks to
common ground regarding respective understanding and positions, he
said.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he strongly believes that his No. 1 priority while
serving in the post is to mend and heal mutual trust and forge an
unfettered communication channel between the two countries. He added
that he was able to exchange views and opinions with U.S. officials
very cordially and frankly.</P>
      <P>Lee took over the post as Taiwan's top liaison official to the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
reiterated Monday his hope for a gentleman's race for the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) chairmanship, saying that the contestants should not
play with the sensitive ethnic issue to win support.</P>
      <P>Wang made the call at a seminar held at the Taichung City Council
with more than 40 scholars while elaborating on his vision of how to
lead the KMT if he is elected party chairman.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that under the governing Democratic Progressive
Party, Taiwan is facing four major crises --- financial
hollowing-out, economic margionalization, ethnic conflict and
insecurity across the Taiwan Strait -- Wang claimed that only a
second power transfer can help the country surmount these problems.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the complex and sensitive ethnic issue has
been brought into the contest by his sole rival in the race and he
called for his competitor to avoid collision for the sake of the
KMT's future. Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou is Wang's only rival in the
race for the chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Wang also said he is confident of building a new future for the
KMT on the grounds that he is the right person to consolidate public
support for the opposition "pan blue alliance" of the KMT and the
People First Party and use the "pan blue" majority advantage at the
Legislative Yuan to help the alliance win back power in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wang and Ma, both of whom are KMT vice chairmen, will compete in
a showdown to win the party chairmanship through a direct vote among
party members set for July 16. Incumbent KMT Chairman Lien Chan is
slated to leave the post in August.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER DEFENDS POLICY ON U.S. BEEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  27  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh defended his
administration's policy on U.S. beef Monday, arguing there was
nothing wrong with a decision two months ago allowing the import of
U.S. beef from cattle younger than 30 months old, although all
imports were banned again Saturday.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from journalists while on an inspection tour
of Orchid Island off the eastern coast of Taiwan, the premier said
safety was the only concern behind the government's decision to ban
U.S. beef Dec. 31, 2003, when America's first bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) case was confirmed. The ban was lifted
conditionally April 16 but reimposed Saturday following confirmation
of a second U.S. case.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said U.S. cattle raised after 1997 -- when a ban of meat
and bone meal in feed went into effect -- are believed to be free
from BSE, which is why his administration decided in April to allow
imports of U.S. beef from cattle less than 30 months old and why it
will allow beef already imported to remain on the market.</P>
      <P>Just as locally produced pork is suitable for consumption in
Taiwan despite it being banned from the U.S. because of
foot-and-mouth disease in Taiwan, U.S. beef is suitable for
consumption in the United States despite the occurrence of BSE there,
Hsieh argued, claiming that all the U.S. beef already in Taiwan is
safe.</P>
      <P>The premier said banning imports of U.S. beef is the easiest way
out, but the government has to take into consideration the interests
of local businessmen who sell U.S. beef and Washington's possible
reactions, the premier said.</P>
      <P>He dismissed as groundless critics' claims that he is trying to
play up to Washington, arguing that there is no point for him to
curry favor with a country that will not even allow him to set foot
on its territory.</P>
      <P>In a related development Monday, four opposition lawmakers from
the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union logged a charge of
"manslaughter" with the prosecutors' office against Health Minister
Hou Sheng-mou, claiming that Hou's office is risking the lives of the
public by "zigzagging" on policy concerning U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>The four lawmakers, led by Legislator Lai Hsin-yuan noted in
their complaint that Hou's office lifted the ban April 16 and that a
health official claimed at that time that U.S. beef was safe. "If
that were true, why was the ban reinstated on Saturday?" they asked.</P>
      <P>"If the beef is dangerous and should be banned, why allow meat
already in the country to remain on the market without being
recalled? There is no explanation other than an unspecified intent to
kill people," they claimed in their complaint, urging the prosecutor
to initiate a probe.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A yellow-blue light was recorded for
Taiwan's economy in May, meaning that the economy was "sluggish, "
although it will rebound in the second half of this year, an official
of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) predicted Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the five-color rating system devised by the CEPD to
gauge Taiwan's economy, red means an overheated economy, yellow-red
represents a heating-up economy, green reflects stability,
yellow-blue stands for sluggishness and blue points to recession.</P>
      <P>Hung Juei-ping, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department, said the composite economic index in May dropped to 18
points, setting a new low since June 2003.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that the leading index climbed 0.8 percent in
May from April, the bigger recent single-month increase. In addition,
the economy of the high-tech industry has rebounded, which will be
favorable to the economy in the next half of the year, he said.</P>
      <P>Of the nine items to gauge the economy in May, stock prices and
new manufacturing orders added one point each, while the money supply
MIb, exports, industrial production and non-agricultural employment
were cut by one point each, making the composite economic index drop
from the 20 points in April.</P>
      <P>The continued slip was due mainly to sluggish industrial
production. The third consecutive month of a yellow-blue light also
showed that the domestic economy was still not in good shape.</P>
      <P>The resurgence of domestic energy prices has added uncertainty to
the economic prospects, but the domestic leading index has begun to
climb and the number of manufacturers who think the economy in the
next three months will decline has dropped to 17 percent, with a
gradual rebound of the high-tech industry, creating a favorable
forecast for the economy in the second half of the year, Huang said.</P>

be fingerprinted in the near future, a senior Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Johnnason Liu said the Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) has drawn up a comprehensive package of regulations for taking
the fingerprints of such Chinese citizens.</P>
      <P>The fingerprinting requirement will be implemented in line with a
new article added to the Statute Governing the Relations Between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, which has been
approved by the Legislative Yuan, Liu said.</P>
      <P>In addition to drafting detailed enforcement rules, Liu said, the
MOI has also already purchased the equipment needed to implement the
new requirement and facilities will be in place for use by mid-July.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan opening its doors ever wider to people from China,
Liu said, the number of Chinese people using false identity papers
has become an increasingly serious problem for the authorities.</P>
      <P>"Many mainland citizens have visited Taiwan several times, using
a different identity each time. As the situation has become worse and
worse, administrative agencies have had to spend a lot of
administrative resources verifying the identity of prospective
visitors," Liu said, adding that the false identity issue is expected
to be minimized after the fingerprinting regulations come into force.</P>
      <P>The new enforcement rules, crafted by the Exit and Entry Bureau
under the MOI's National Police Administration, clearly singles out
targets to be subject to fingerprinting, the venue for
fingerprinting, the establishment of a fingerprint databank and
safeguards of the databank, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the new fingerprinting requirement is part of the
measures to substantitate the policy of "proactive liberalization
with effective management" toward cross-strait exchanges, Liu said
the new measure will facilitate the security management of Chinese
immigrants.</P>
      <P>As to whether the fingerprinting measure will be expanded to all
Chinese visitors, Liu said the MAC -- the nation's top China policy
planner -- will call an interministerial meeting in the near future
to discuss whether the existing statute should be further revised to
fingerprint all incoming citizens from China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Defense Minister Lee Jye said
Monday that a solid military force and strong will to fight are key
to victory.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a pep-speech to graduating cadets of
five military academies at Fu Hsing Kang College in Taipei.</P>
      <P>He said the military has in recent years dedicated itself to the
buildup of a modern military force. It has continued to streamline
military personnel, hoping to build a solid force with strong combat
ability.</P>
      <P>Faced with the military threat of China, Lee urged the nation not
to hinge its hopes on the goodwill of the enemy and not to rely on
assistance from the international community, but to rely on the
country's own strength.</P>
      <P>He also urged the cadets to accept challenges and understand that
a crisis can also be a turning point so that they can move with the

      <P>A total of 110 visiting Chinese
professionals have been repatriated in the past three months for
engaging in activities incompatible with the stated purposes of their
visits, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"We feel regret that the visiting professionals have failed to

Liu said.</P>
      <P>With the number of visiting Chinese professionals who have
engaged in such activities increasing steadily, Liu said, the
government has demanded their local hosts assume more responsibility
in identity verification, swift reporting of major events involving
visiting Chinese professionals, and spot checks.</P>
      <P>Besides repatriating rule-breaking Chinese visitors, Liu said
their local hosts will also be fined and disciplined in accordance
with the law for the sake of maintaining orderly exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, Liu went on, a delegation from a temple
dedicated to the Chinese Goddess of the Sea in Meizhou in the
southeastern Chinese Province of Fujian was repatriated because it
changed its itinerary to engage in a "united front" publicity

    <HEADLINE>KMT: U.S. ASSESSMENT OF CHINA'S THREAT MAY NOT BE ACCURATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  27  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An assessment by U.S. defense and
intelligence officials that China might attack Taiwan in two years is
not accurate because it does not take into consideration the recent
lowering of tension across the Taiwan Strait, a China expert said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a Washington Times report that Pentagon officials
fear that Beijing "will attack Taiwan in the next two years, " Chang
Jung-kung, spokesman for the opposition Kuomintang, noted that the
analysis was made purely from a military point of view.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times report Sunday said China is building its
military forces faster than U.S. intelligence and military analysts
expected, which has prompted fears that Beijing will attack Taiwan in
two years and then be forced to go to war with the United States,
which has vowed to defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the Pentagon assessment does not take into
consideration what he claimed is the latest development that the
relationship between Taiwan and China has entered a new phase since
KMT Chairman Lien Chan's journey of peace to China in late April and
early May.</P>
      <P>"As long as President Chen Shui-bian does not push for de jure
independence of Taiwan during the rest of his term, the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait will be out of the shadow of war until the next
presidential election in March 2008," he said.</P>
      <P>Chang quoted various Chinese think tanks as claiming that Lien's
visit to China has "defused" the crisis of war in the Taiwan Strait.
In his view, the assumption that China might attack Taiwan in two
years will not happen, unless Chen uses a second stage of
constitutional reforms to seek de jure independence.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that after Lien's visit to China, Beijing's policy
toward Taiwan began to stress cross-strait exchanges once again.
This, he said, has reduced the pressure faced by Taiwan from China's
military buildup.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEC TO BE IN CHARGE OF REDRAWING CONSTITUENCY BORDERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) will
form a screening committee to redraw the country's constituency
borders, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said Monday.</P>
      <P>DPP whips William Lai and Jao Yung-ching made the remarks after
CEC Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung reported on the timetable for
redrawing constituency lines at a coordination meeting of government
and DPP officials at the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>CEC officials said the redrawing of the borders should be
promulgated one year before the term of the incumbent legislators
expires, which means it should be announced by Jan. 31, 2007 at the
latest.
</P>
      <P>According to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law, the
redrawing will be decided by the CEC and the CEC will form a
screening committee on the issue, taking into consideration views
provided by local election commissions.</P>
      <P>Jao said that the CEC is responsible for the task and that
credible figures recommended by the public will be asked to sit on
the screening committee.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan should not form a screening committee with
its members formed in proportion of the ratio of each political
party, because it would lead to a political struggle and
"gerrymandering," Jao continued.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-chun, another DPP whip, said the redistricting of
constituencies does not require prior approval from the Legislative
Yuan and he added that legislative power must not supersede executive
power.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CEC should listen to public views on the matter and
redraw the boundaries based on the principles of population,
structure, region and culture.</P>
      <P>On an opposition Kuomintang proposal that the redistricting of
the constituencies should need the approval of the Legislative Yuan,
Chen said that such a political struggle would render the electoral
reform of "single seat, two votes" meaningless.</P>
      <P>The National Assembly passed early this month a constitutional
amendment package, one of the major items of which was to change the
electoral system from multiple seats in a constituency into the
"single seat, two votes" system.
</P>
      <P>Starting from the seventh legislature to be elected in 2007, the
Legislative Yuan will have only 113 seats and will be elected every
four years. While 73 seats will be elected from regional districts,
there will be six seats for aboriginal representatives and 34 seats
for at-large and overseas expatriate representatives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FISHERY ADMINISTRATION PROTESTS JAPANESE COAST GUARD DISTURBANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Fishery Administration has demanded
that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) lodge a protest with
Japan over Japanese coast guard ships that interfered with the
operations of a Taiwan fishing boat the previous day, an official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official was referring to the Chinjuifeng No. 168 -- a
Suao-based fishing boat that was served a notice by Japanese coast
guard ships while operating in waters close to the middle line of the
two countries' overlapping exclusive economic zones, also known
locally as the "tentative demarcation line," on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Japanese coast guard demanded that the Chinjuifeng leave the
waters, which lie some 60 nautical miles east of the Tiaoyutai
Islands -- a group of uninhabited islets in the East China Sea
claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>The Fishery Administration official said the Japanese move was
unacceptable because the Chinjuifeng did not cross the "tentative
demarcation line."</P>
      <P>"Acting on the Chinjuifeng's emergency request for help, we
immediately asked the Coast Guard Administration to send patrol ships
to the waters in question to protect our fishermen's legitimate
fishing rights and safety," the official said.</P>
      <P>Three Taiwan coast guard patrol vessels swiftly went to the
disputed region to ensure the Chinjuifa's safety and smooth
operations, the official said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the Fishery Administration has demanded
that the MOFA convey its protest over the Japanese coast guard's
disturbance of the Taiwan fishing boat's operations.</P>
      <P>In the future, the official said, local fishermen should use
fishery radio stations or the CGA's 118 hotline to inform relevant
government agencies whenever they are disturbed by Japanese coast
guard patrol ships while operating within Taiwan's exclusive economic
waters.</P>
      <P>"We are determined to make every possible effort to protect our
fishermen's rights and safety," he added.</P>
      <P>The incident came after the Ministry of National Defense, under
strong pressure from opposition lawmakers, sent a Knox-class frigate
on a visit to the disputed waters last Tuesday, supposedly to
accentuate Taiwan's determination to protect its fishermen's rights
and safety. Some 15 lawmakers from across the party spectrum, led by
Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng, took the cruise aboard the
warship in the company of Defense Minister Lee Jye.</P>
      <P>At the heart of the dispute is the two countries' sovereignty
claim to the Tiaoyutai Islands. Both Tokyo and Taipei claim that the
island group falls within their 200-mile exclusive economic zones.
Japan often fines ship owners and impounds Taiwanese fishing vessels
that enter waters close to the Tiaoyutais.</P>
      <P>The previous 14 rounds of Taiwan-Japanese fishery talks did not
make significant headway because Taiwan would not forsake its
sovereignty claim to the Tiaoyutais, which Japan has held since 1971.</P>
      <P>The dispute came into the limelight again recently after some 50
Taiwan fishing boats staged a rare protest in the disputed waters
over Japanese coast guard ships that frequently chase them away from
the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>66% OF TAIWAN MANUFACTURERS SEE BUSINESS CLIMATE EVEN IN 3 MONTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two-thirds of Taiwan manufacturers see the
country's business climate even in the coming three months, according
to the results of a survey released Monday by the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted in May, shows that 66 percent of the
respondents believe the business climate will remain unchanged in the
next three months, while 17 percent predict it will be improved and
another 17 percent have a negative outlook.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing sector's sales decreased in May by 2.9 percent
from the previous month's level and by 1.2 percent year-on-year,
while new orders received by the manufacturers fell by 2.3 percent
from the April but rose by 2.6 percent from the previous year's
level.</P>
      <P>The utilization ratio of installed facilities stood in May at the
same mark of 79.8 percent posted in the previous month and 0.5
percentage points less than the figure recorded a year ago.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the profit earned from their sales was at an
average of 4.9 percent, down 0.1 percentage points from the previous
month's level and 0.3 percentage points less than that of the last
year.</P>
      <P>The CEPD rated Taiwan's economy in May with a yellow-blue light,
meaning that the economy was sluggish.</P>
      <P>According to the five-color rating system devised by the CEPD to
gauge Taiwan's economy, red means an overheated economy, yellow-red
represents a heating-up economy, green reflects stability,
yellow-blue stands for sluggishness and blue points to recession.</P>
      <P>However, the leading index climbed 0.8 percent in May, a sign

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), a government planning agency, approved Monday a
skeleton program drawn up by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to
prevent flooding.</P>
      <P>The program, brought up by the MOEA earlier this year, will spend
NT$80 billion (US$25.51 billion) over eight years to fix flood
problems that have plagued central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The program is all the more urgent when more than 500 square
kilometers of land was inundated early this month after days of
torrential rain. Specialists blamed ground subsidence caused by
over-pumping of groundwater from aquifers for the disaster.</P>
      <P>In approving the program, the CEPD noted that the country suffers
damage of NT$12.8 billion on average every year from flooding
triggered by typhoons and heavy rain.</P>
      <P>It noted that nine typhoons hit Taiwan in 2004 and one of them,
Mindulle, which barrelled across the country from June 28 to July 3,
inundated 659 square kilometers of land.</P>
      <P>In order to reduce the damage caused by floods, the CEPD said the
flood-control program should focus on the areas hardest-hit.</P>
      <P>The program approved by the CEPD is only a skeleton and still has
to be fleshed out by specific plans put forth by local governments
and approved by the MOEA.</P>
      <P>After being approved by the CEPD, the program will be presented
to the Cabinet for a final decision.</P>

beef Monday, saying the administration did not contradict itself by
dropping a ban on imports and reinstating it Saturday.</P>

American cattle population.</P>
      <P>He said he has directed Premier Frank Hsieh to do whatever
it takes to ensure that the economy will grow by 4 percent this year

is never presumptuous and never regards anything as beneath his
notice or as unworthy of serious and careful attention -- that is
what is meant by being dignified without being supercilious."</TEXT>

President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo last night

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIES INCREASINGLY SHIFTING TO CHINA: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said late Monday
that Taiwan high-technology industries have increasingly tilted to
China, making it imperative for the administration to exert tighter
controls for national security as well as for the industries' own
survival.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local TV station, Chen noted that relaxing
the policy on cross-strait exchanges can only be done when there is
an effective management mechanism in place.</P>
      <P>Noting that even liberal governments like that of the United
States maintain controls on high-technology exports, Chen said that
it is "right and necessary" for the government to impose some
controls on China-bound Taiwan companies, particularly those in the
high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed the hope that the Legislative Yuan will pass a
science and technology protection bill as soon as possible so that
there will be "clear rules of the game" in place for the business
sector to follow and for the administration to enforce.</P>
      <P>Stressing that China is not "any foreign country, " particularly
to Taiwan, Chen said that investing in China "is not simply a matter
of mutual benefit." While the government should do its part to
maintain Taiwan industries' international competitiveness and
national security, all the Taiwan companies maintaining business
operations in China should "keep the political risks in mind, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Taking Chi Mei Optoelectronics as an example, Chen said that when
the company first entered China, the chairman of the company at the
time, Hsu Wen-lung, was given all sorts of special treatment. But
after the company settled there, the Chinese communists "changed
their face" and "the conveniences enjoyed by the company turned into
illegalities," the president said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that in 2001, his administration changed the former "no
haste, be patient" policy, aimed at reining in Taiwan investment in
China, into a new "active opening, effective management" policy in
the hopes that Taiwan industries and businesses could "plow deep
locally and position themselves globally" in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The president urged the Taiwan businesspeople operating in China
to keep their core business base and research and development in
Taiwan while making money overseas, noting that China is not "the
only or last market in the world." He also reminded them to "send
some money back" as few of the China-based Taiwanese companies have
repaid their investment funds that were sourced from Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Justices Allow a
Commandments Display, Bar Others.

A fractured Supreme Court on Monday upheld a six-foot-high Ten
Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas Capitol while
ruling that framed copies of the Commandments on the walls of two
Kentucky courthouses were unconstitutional. The question was whether
either display violated the First Amendment's prohibition against an
official "establishment" of religion. It appeared to be that
religious symbols that have been on display for many years, with
little controversy, are likely to be upheld, while newer displays
intended to advance a modern religious agenda will be met with
suspicion and disfavor from the court.

Wall Street Journal: Breaking Taboos, Japan Redefines Its Role
With China.

Relations between Japan and China are at their tensest level in
decades. One cause has been Chinese outrage over visits by Japanese
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to a religious shrine that
commemorates Japan's war dead, including people convicted of war
crimes against China and other Allied countries. In Japan, there has
been rising anxiety about China's growing economic and political
strength. But behind the scenes in Tokyo, another factor has also
altered ties between Asia's two biggest powers: the emergence of a
new generation of leaders with new notions about Japan's role in the
world.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ROC  DESIGNATION IN WTO DIRECTORY UNCHANGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June  28 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has successfully
retained the designation of its permanent mission to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in the new WTO Directory which was printed
recently,</P>
      <P>As WTO Director-General Supachai Panitchpakdi and other officials
of the Secretariat of the organization could not resolve a dispute
between Taiwan and China on the name of the island's representation
to the organization, the world trade body has been unable to revise
the contents of the directory since it was issued in October 2002.</P>
      <P>In February 2003, Beijing requested a change of the designation
of Taiwan's delegation to the WTO and the official titles of its
members.</P>
      <P>The procrastination of renewing the directory has caused
inconvenience in the operations and communications of the WTO and
many WTO members have requested the Secretariat of the organization
to tackle the matter as soon as possible. Normally, WTO issues the
directory twice a year in April and October.</P>
      <P>Supachai, who is set to leave office in August this year and does
not want to hand over the so-called "hot potato issue" to his
successor, eventually decided last week to issue a new WTO directory
after thoroughly taking cross-strait and other relevant situations
into consideration. In the new edition of the WTO Directory, Taiwan
still has the designation " Permanent Mission of the Separate
Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu to the World Trade
Organization, " demonstrating that China's attempt to downgrade the
name of Taiwan's delegation to the WTO from "permanent mission" to
"economic and trade office" or "permanent representative office" was
unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, instead of using official diplomatic titles to
address the members of the mission as it did before, the WTO only
allows the Taiwan officials to use honorifics such as Mr., Mrs. Or
Miss in the new WTO Directory. Except for the ROC's permanent
representative to the WTO, who has never used "ambassador" as his
official diplomatic title, all other members of the Taiwan delegation
to the WTO have always been addressed using their respective official
titles, including minister, councilor, first secretary, second
secretary and third secretary, in the directory.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan was flexible in dealing with the matter, it
fiercely opposed the WTO changing the official title of the members
of the Taiwan permanent mission. Lin Yi-fu, Taiwan's permanent
representative to the WTO, immediately made a written and an oral
protest to Supachai after received a copy of the new WTO directory,
saying that he cannot accept the new directory and requested that the
WTO reprint it.</P>
      <P>Noting that he fully understands Taiwan's stance and concern
about the matter, the WTO executive head said that he himself and the
WTO Secretariat spared no effort over the past two years to make
everyone happy.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the new directory contains a note by Supachai
emphasizing that the WTO's director-general has the authority and
responsibility to prepare and issue the directory and that the
directory can only be used between the WTO Secretariat and the WTO
members. The note also said that all the information included in the
directory is purely for the use of strengthening contact between the
delegations of WTO member states and the WTO Secretariat, adding that
nothing in the directory will affect any delegation's legal rights or
obligations.</P>
      <P>According to Article XII of the "Marrakesh Agreement
Establishing the World Trade Organization, " Supachai also said in
his note that "any state or separate customs territory possessing
full autonomy in the conduct of its external commercial relations and
of the other matters provided for in this agreement and the
Multilateral Trade Agreements may accede to this agreement." All the
terms used in the article to describe the name provided by a customs
territory delegation and the note of the WTO Secretariat bear no
"sovereignty meanings."</P>
      <P>Part of the contents of Supachai's note were made under the
request of Taiwan while some contents of the note were formed to help
the WTO Secretariat avoid facing the complicated and sensitive
problem of sovereignty.</P>
      <P>A source close to the WTO said that since the problem relating to
the name of the Taiwan delegation to the WTO and its members'
official diplomatic titles are political problems between the two WTO
member states, which do not fall within the jurisdiction of the WTO
authorities, Supachai and the WTO Secretariat, in order to let
the world trade body run smoothly, cannot but assume the
responsibility to solve the problem.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU DEMANDS LOW PRICES FOR OIL, WATER AND ELECTRICITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) on
Tuesday demanded that the government maintain its original policy of
low rates for oil, water and electricity even thought public
utilities are pushing to raise prices.</P>
      <P>Executives of TSU's legislative caucus made the appeal at a
meeting where officials from state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC), Taiwan Water Corp., Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower), as well as
the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) were invited to
explain their future policies.</P>
      <P>Chang Hung-chiang, deputy general manager of CPC, noted that
international oil prices have exceeded US$60 per barrel, but the CPC
only increased oil prices for the first time this year in March,
resulting in a loss of NT$10 billion so far this year.</P>
      <P>Chang admitted that there is price hike pressure for oil, but
"prices are decided by the market, " and the CPC has not set any
readjustment scale in advance.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-san, a Taipower executive, said the company has not
increased its electricity prices since 1983. On the contrary, it has
readjusted downward the prices 11 times, he added.</P>
      <P>However, due to the soaring prices for oil and coal in
international markets in the last few years, Taipower suffered
additional spending of NT$47 billion in 2003, Chang stressed, saying
that the company cannot afford more losses.</P>
      <P>TSU lawmakers estimated that if all these prices are increased at
the same time in the second half of this year, every family will have
to spend several thousand NT dollars more each month. They urged the
government to supply these basic daily necessities at low prices.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng said the
government should keep its promise in previous election campaigns of
not increasing water and electricity rates.</P>
      <P>Wang made the appeal following the remarks made by Premier Frank
Hsieh Monday that the government will not exclude the possibility of
increasing electricity rates this fall or winter, and is expected to
readjust upward oil prices if its international price exceed US$60
per barrel.</P>
      <P>Wang stressed that this was not an opportune time for the
government to increase rates for daily necessities as many people are
living in poverty, urging the government to keep its promises made in
election campaigns.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA BEHIND WTO DIRECTORY CHANGES TO TAIWAN: FOREIGN MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan on Monday accused China of plotting
to change the titles of the Republic of China's World Trade
Organization (WTO) officials in the WTO directory, although China
ultimately failed to force Taiwan to give up its "permanent mission"
title.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said
this indicates that China is not interested in having mutually
beneficial interactions with Taiwan in the WTO.</P>
      <P>In the latest edition of the WTO members' directory, published in
June, 2005, the titles of all Taiwan officials except for those of
the permanent representative and his deputy, were deleted -- such
titles as counselor, first secretary and second secretary no longer
appear before the names of Taiwan officials bearing those titles.
Only their names and their main lines of business were printed.</P>
      <P>Lu said the government has asked its mission in the WTO to lodge
a protest with the WTO Secretariat for unilaterally changing the
contents of the data presented by the mission and to demand that the
directory be reprinted.</P>
      <P>He said the WTO Secretariat was under pressure from China, and
this incident once again shows that China has been doing all it can
to shrink Taiwan's international space, contradicting its own promise
to develop good interactive relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the trend continues, he pointed out, mutual trust between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait will all but disappear and the
possibility of improving bilateral ties will become even slimmer, Lu
said.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, he noted, the WTO directory is not an
official document with any legal status; it's but an address book for
internal use, and therefore will in no way affect Taiwan's legal
rights and privileges in the WTO and in the country where it is
located.</P>
      <P>Ever since Taiwan became the WTO's 114th member in Jan. 2002,
China has tried repeatedly to change the title of Taiwan's mission
into something like Hong Kong or Macau's Economic and Trade Office
that does not imply sovereignty of a state, according to Lu.</P>
      <P>He added that under endless pressure from China, the
secretary-general of the WTO has suggested that Taiwan change its
title into the Office of the Permanent Representative.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has a solid legal basis for using "permanent mission"
as its official title in the WTO as well as support from friendly
countries, China's attempts to change that title have not been
successful, he said.</P>
      <P>Lu urged the WTO Secretariat to remain neutral and not to be
threatened by any member into damaging another member's legal rights
in the WTO, in accordance with the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing
the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>By caving in to China and deleting the titles of Taiwan's WTO
officials in the directory, the WTO Secretariat has violated its role
as a neutral entity and the member-driven principle of the
organization, he said.</P>

Peripheral Seas and Relevant Policies, sponsored by the Ocean
Business Research Committee, Chang Yuan-hsu, director of the MOI
Department of Land Administration, said that the central government
is resolutely determined to address Taiwan's fishing disputes with
Japan even though it is a thorny issue.</P>
      <P>On the prospects of the forthcoming 15th round of Taiwan-Japan
fishery talks, which is expected mainly to tackle the problems of
overlapped exclusive economic zones, Chang said that Japan is not
expected to yield much or make its position known in the meeting for
fear of agitating China, under whose "one China" policy, Taiwan is
part of China.</P>
      <P>Chang continued to say that even if Taiwan-related affairs are
brought to the negotiating table, the Taiwan negotiating team is at a
disadvantage due to the country's attenuated diplomatic status.</P>
      <P>However, Chang said that if Japanese fishermen experienced the
same miserable treatment that has been suffered by Taiwan fishermen,
Japan would have a different attitude at the fishery talks.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan taking tougher measures against Japanese
fishing boats, such as impounding their vessels and fining the boat
owners, for trespassing on Taiwan's exclusive economic zone, may be a
viable strategy for Taiwan not to lose too much ground at the
forthcoming meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER VOWS TO PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin said
Tuesday local prosecutors should enhance exchanges with their foreign
counterparts to help deepen Taiwan's judicial assistance and
cooperation with other countries.</P>
      <P>Shih made the call in a keynote speech delivered at the opening a
seminar on international judicial assistance in criminal
investigations.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has forged various kinds of judicial aid
mechanisms with the United States, Canada, Singapore, Thailand,
Australia and Malaysia, Shih said local prosecutors should take even
more active steps in developing contacts and exchanges with their
counterparts in major countries around the world to help upgrade
Taiwan's profile in the international judicial community.</P>
      <P>"If we can forge judicial aid agreements with more countries with
which we do not have diplomatic ties, it will contribute to our
diplomatic work," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih said, Taiwan should continue judicial reform to
live up to public expectations of judicial functions. In his view, he
said, the role of prosecutors should be diversified and prosecutors
should play a more active role in criminal indictment, crime
prevention and legal education.</P>
      <P>The seminar, with a theme of "Taiwan as a member of the global
society, " was organized by major local prosecutors associations with
an aim of forging judicial aid channels with countries that do not
maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Scores of prosecutors and other judicial personnel from the
Netherlands, Britain, Thailand, Japan and South Korea have traveled
to Taipei to attend the seminar to offer counseling on steps to
promote international judicial aid based on their respective
countries' experiences.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU'S DECISION TO HAVE CONTACTS WITH CHINA DRAWS MIXED REACTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on Tuesday would not make comment after its ally, the
pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) announced that it will
adopt a pragmatic approach on cross-strait issues and start to have
exchanges with China, but the opposition parties expressed welcome to
such a move.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the TSU said Tuesday that private
exchanges between Taiwan and China are indeed frequent, and the time
to review the "no haste, be patient" policy, which was initiated by
former President Lee Teng-hui in 1996, has come.</P>
      <P>"To let China know the true voice of Taiwan's private sector,
the TSU will not be absent from cross-strait exchanges that will
enhance bilateral understanding," the TSU legislative caucus said.</P>
      <P>Ho Ming-hao, TSU whip in the legislature, said that Lee
Hsien-nian, director of TSU's Policy Committee, broached the new 
pragmatic approach in a party central executive committee meeting 
Monday, which was received positively by a majority of members of the
central executive committee although the party will still solicit
views from all quarters.</P>
      <P>"Former President Lee didn't have prior knowledge of the matter,"
Ho said. Lee is the spiritual leader of the four-year-old party.</P>
      <P>Ho said that the TSU's stance that cross-strait exchanges should
be based on a state-to-state basis and on equal footing, that direct
cargo cross-strait transportation links should come first before
those of personnel exchanges, and that direct cross-strait air links
should be considered as international flights remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>"But if the TSU consistently refuses to have dialogues with
China, the latter will have no way of understanding the real needs of
the Taiwan people, " he said, and this is why the party's central
executive committee has decided to make contact with China.</P>
      <P>He said that the TSU will actively participate in a cross-strait
peace committee initiated by President Chen Shui-bian, which he said
will enhance cross-strait understanding so that "the local Taiwan
people will have a say" in cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>A DPP spokesman said that it will have no comment on the
adjustment of the TSU's attitude regarding contact with China.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP's Information and Cultural
Affairs Department, noted that the DPP central standing committee
passed aresolution on political parties visiting China in April to
the effect that Taiwan, as a pluralistic and democratic society,
political parties might have different views on cross-strait
development, but they will safeguard Taiwan's democracy, sovereignty,
and express Taiwan's free will to choose and its determination to
pursue peace.</P>
      <P>He said that the development of cross-strait relations will be a
long, winding road, and that the recent visits to China by two major
opposition leaders -- Chairman Lien Chan of the Kuomintang and
Chairman James Soong of the People First Party -- had tilted too much
toward China, which he said has somewhat distorted Taiwan's image.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-chun, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, said the
TSU's announcement caught the DPP by surprise, and the party urged
the TSU to explain clearly its U-turn as the TSU has consistently
exhorted that one must not think of the enemy as the "motherland."</P>
      <P>However, both the KMT and the PFP welcomed the TSU's attitude
shift.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said that Lien suggested
cross-strait party-to-party exchanges five years ago, and that the
KMT is happy to see that the DPP and the TSU have begun to toe the
KMT's line on cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that the first step for the TSU to have exchanges
with China is for the party to forego its Taiwan-independence
advocacy, saying that party-to-party exchanges will be based on
goodwill, and if the party continues to advocate Taiwan independence
and the nation's official name rectification as well as writing a new
constitution, he couldn't see any basis for bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-ping, PFP caucus whip in the legislature, said that
TSU's pragmatic approach in attempting to visit Hong Kong, and taking
part in a cross-strait peace committee will help reduce Taiwan
independence sentiments and cross-strait animosity.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmaker condemned China Tuesday over what he called
Beijing's extreme oppression of Taiwan for pressuring the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to change the island's information in its new
directory.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from China, Taiwan's officials to the WTO are
being addressed as "Mr." and "Miss" instead of their official titles
in the WTO directory renewed last week.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said China
is being two-faced by welcoming Taiwan farm exports on the one hand
and isolating Taiwan internationally on the other.</P>
      <P>However, Chen Chih-pin, convener of the opposition People First
Party legislative caucus, said the government should examine the way
it deals with the matter because it failed to take any precautions
beforehand or any countermeasures afterwards.</P>
      <P>Sharing a similar view, Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Lai
Hsin-yuan said the matter shows that the country's permanent mission
to the WTO has failed to fulfill its duty to defend Taiwan's
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Lai demanded that the WTO mission fight for Taiwan's right and
ask the WTO Secretariat to restore the titles of the Taiwan
officials.</P>
      <P>Lai pointed out that the titles of the officials have been
recognized by the Swiss government and that the WTO Secretariat has
no right to change the information provided by its member nations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Monday he is willing to meet with his Chinese counterpart Hu
Jintao in a third country, but while Beijing has not yet made any
official response, a Beijing scholar claimed Tuesday that such a
meeting is unlikely.</P>
      <P>Chen told a TV station in Taipei that he is ready to meet with Hu
in a third country provided there are no additional prior conditions
attached, including the "one-China" principle and the so-called 1992
consensus on a tacit agreement that there is one China and that
either side of the Taiwan Strait can make its own interpretation of
what "one China" means.</P>
      <P>Chen explained that the reason why his proposed meeting with Hu
should be in a third country is that he would refuse to go to China,
while Hu is also unlikely to come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Xu Bodong, director of the Taiwan Research Institute at Beijing
University, said that a meeting between Hu and Chen in a third
country would signify a meeting between two chiefs of state.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing cannot possibly give up its "one-China" policy,
which he said is Beijing's "bottom line."</P>
      <P>Xu noted that the one-China principle was not something imposed
by Beijing upon Taiwan, because the ROC Constitution is based on the
one-China framework.</P>
      <P>In China, scholars of important think tanks usually simply parrot
the official line of the government in Beijing.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  28  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the
Legislative Yuan Tuesday to review as soon as possible an eight-year,
NT$80 billion (US$2.54 billion) flood-control budget.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal at a meeting with group chiefs of irrigation

      <P>Citing as an example the flood control project for the Keelung
River, Chen said the NT$31.6 billion inundation-prevention plan faced
strong opposition at that time.</P>
      <P>However, those opposing the project have been proved wrong, as
the Keelung River flood-control program has resolved the inundation
problem in the areas around the river, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Due to the heavy losses caused by recent flooding in central and
southern Taiwan, the Cabinet has decided to allocate NT$80 billion to
resolve the inundation problems in these areas within eight years, a
task that was originally estimated to take 80 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CITIZENS WORRY SUICIDE REPORTS COULD BRING IMITATIONS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey has found that the public mostly
thinks media reports on suicide cases will fan a suicide epidemic and
imitations, and hopes the media carries such reports with restraint.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by associate professor Lyu Shu-yu of the
Department of Public Health of Taipei Medical University and the TVBS
poll center in May under the commission of the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Lyu said on Tuesday that 93.5 percent of the respondents believed
the media has dealt with cases suicide in a manner of repetition and
overload, while 67 percent said the way that media reported news
concerning suicides was very sensational and detailed.</P>
      <P>Citing examples of the suicides of actor Leslie Cheung and
comedian Ni Min-jan, the researcher said that media conspicuously and
graphically exposed how they took their own lives, then beautified
and glorified the apparent reasons.</P>
      <P>In comparison, information on suicide control and prevention
appears poor, she noted.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 59.8 percent of the people answering
the poll expressed their concern that media reports on suicide cases
could encourage copycat deaths.</P>
      <P>About 20 percent of the respondents said they were often stricken
by panic or with psychological pressure after reading, watching or
hearing reports on someone's suicide, while the number of those
polled who indicated suicide news could prevent similar tragedies
from happening registered only less than 1 percent.</P>
      <P>In general, Lyu said over 90 percent of the respondents believed
media should not conduct live reports concerning a suicide, while 87
percent thought the media coverage of a suicide should be reduced.</P>
      <P>Television footage the audience does not like to see is the body
of the dead person and how the suicide happened, she noted.</P>
      <P>Lyu said that in a two-week period right after Ni hanged himself
in late April, she and other researchers visited four hospitals,
finding that at three of the medical facilities, the number of
attempted suicide patients had doubled during the period.</P>
      <P>One of the three hospitals even told them that in the first two
weeks of May, when countrywide media was crazy about reporting Ni's
suicide, the number of attempted suicide patients sent to their
emergency rooms was about the same as the number of such patients
admitted in the hospital from January to April, she indicated.</P>
      <P>Professor Chang Chin-hua of National Taiwan University said that
since the media craze about Ni's hanging hit the screens, statistics
have been rising daily about the number of people killing themselves.
She suspected that the media might have become a "murderer."</P>
      <P>To prevent the media from turning into a "murderer," Lyu advised
three "noes" regarding suicide reportage, including no front page
coverage, no repeating and overloading reports, and no live
reports or sensational photos.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu and Palauan
President Tommy Remengesau jointly presided Tuesday over the opening
of the Palau Royal Resort Hotel, built with funding from Taiwanese
businessmen.</P>
      <P>Lu said at the opening that Taiwan-Palau relations will be even
more solid because of the close cooperation between President Chen
Shui-bian and Remengesau.</P>
      <P>Remengesau said the opening of the hotel represents closer
relations between the two countries and that Lu's visit to his
country is an indication of that close friendship.</P>
      <P>The Royal Resort, a six-story, 158-room hotel, is the newest and
one of the largest five-star hotels in Palau, an island nation with
rich ocean tourism resources that is a popular destination for
tourists, particularly Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Of the more-than 90,000 tourists who visited Palau last year,
Taiwan tourists accounted for more than 40,000.</P>
      <P>Lu suggested to the Far East Air Transport Corp., which operates
a direct Taiwan-Palau route, that it should arrange Friday flights to
Palau and Sunday return flights so as to attract more Taiwan
tourists.</P>
      <P>In the evening, Lu attended a banquet that was also attended by
Palau dignitaries and members of her Taiwan delegation, including
James Huang, vice secretary-general of the Presidential Office and
Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Ouyang Jui-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Remengesau recently renewed an invitation to Chen to make a

      <P>Lee said there will never be lasting peace across the strait if
cross-strait relations are not normalized, because a bad neighbor

Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tung Li-wen, head of the DPP's Department of Chinese Affairs,

for either candidate.</P>
      <P>Although Chang did not mention any names, his comment was
believed to refer to Ma, who was quoted in Tuesday's United Daily

terms with Wang than with him, many of the PFP rank and file -- who
he said are the ones who really matter in any elections -- favor him.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after being asked to comment on speculation

Wang will allow them to save face by letting them incorporate into

    <TEXT>
      <P>As a fishing dispute between Taiwan and
Japan has again become a hot topic, an official suggested Tuesday
that the government prepare an ad hoc team to negotiate with Japan to
settle the dispute.</P>
      <P>Chang Yuan-hsu, director of the Land Administration Department of
the Ministry of the Interior, put forward a five-point strategy when
he delivered a report on drawing the border of the country's
exclusive economic zone (EEZ).</P>
      <P>"Some territorial sea issues can be settled simply by making
domestic laws, while others must be handled in accordance with
international law or precedent, " he told a seminar discussing
Taiwan's surrounding waters and related issues.</P>
      <P>The first point of his strategy is to legislate more domestic
laws, as existing ones are inadequate, including assigning a
government agency to take care of law-breaking seamen and ships, and
designating another to mete out fines.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government take reference from the U.S.
coast guard or Japan's maritime authorities, which have rules for
implementing laws.</P>
      <P>Secondly, he suggested that the government speed up a survey of
the country's territorial waters and then establish an
information-exchange platform that will eventually expand into a
national databank on the nation's territorial waters.</P>
      <P>His third proposal is to beef up sea patrols. He noted that after
Taiwan published an EEZ temporary borderline in 2003 -- a move meant
to show Japan Taiwan's determination to maintain its EEZ -- both law
enforcement officials and fishermen have had a "rule" to follow.</P>
      <P>Fourthly, Chang proposed that the government gather comprehensive
information on international law and precedent that can be used to
help reach a deal with Japan.</P>
      <P>Fifth, he said, a competent negotiation team that has legal,
geographic, geological, historical, topographic and other experts as
members must soon be organized to talk with Japan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Su Jia-Chyuan said
Tuesday at a seminar on Taiwan's surrounding waters that a
provisional legal boundary in the overlapping economic zones of
Taiwan and Japan in waters northeast of Taiwan has taken into
consideration many factors.</P>
      <P>The seminar was held at the Executive Yuan in the wake of a
recent protest by about 60 Taiwanese trawlers in waters 80 nautical
miles northeast of Taiwan against Japanese coast guard ships that
chase them from what they claim are their traditional fishing grounds
on many occasions.</P>
      <P>The waters near a number of small uninhabited islands known as
the Tiaoyutais, which are claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China, are
claimed by Taiwan as traditional fishing grounds. However, Japan
demarcated the area as part of its 200-mile economic zone in 1996 and
has since often impounded Taiwanese fishing vessels that enter the
region, fining their owners.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior at the end of 2003 drew a
provisional line within the Republic of China's 200-mile exclusive
economic zone at the mid-point between the overlapping zones and the
government has urged Taiwan fishermen to operate within the
provisional line so as to avoid fishery disputes.</P>
      <P>Grilled by some scholars as to whether the provisional legal
boundary is too timid, Su pointed out that the boundary was not
demarcated by his ministry but was drawn after taking into
consideration geographic and historical factors, as well as the views
of scholars.</P>
      <P>He said that drawing the economic zone involves not only
demarcation but also sovereignty issues, especially since the
Tiaoyutai island group is claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan, and has
to be solved through diplomatic procedures.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan are scheduled to hold fishery talks next month
to discuss issues resulted from their overlapping 200-mile exclusive
economic zones.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China will begin to build its first
aircraft carrier in August at a cost of 30 billion yuan (about US$362
million), according to a report by China's www.Boxun.com.</P>
      <P>The report said the carrier, which the web site claims will have
a displacement of 78,000 tons, will be built by the Jiangnan Shipyard
in Shanghai although this has been denied by Zhan Guangqin, deputy
chief of China's Commission of Science Technology and Industry for
National Defense.</P>
      <P>The unconfirmed report quoted an unnamed engineer at the shipyard
as saying that Russian experts will help with the fitting of a
steam-turbine propeller that will give the giant vessel a top speed
of 32 knots.</P>
      <P>It claimed that the carrier will go into service in 2006 at the
earliest and that it will take two more years to combine the
operations of the vessel with those of jet fighters to form a
combative force.</P>
      <P>Weapons experts, however, pointed out that it seems "too
optimistic" to build an aircraft carrier in just one year and to
develop a battle group in three years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CGA CHIEF CALLS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF OCEAN AFFAIRS MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should set up an Ocean Affairs
Ministry to more efficiently protect its territorial waters and
marine resources, the nation's coast guard chief said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Coast Guard Administration Minister Shi Hwei-yow made the remarks
while addressing the opening of a symposium on the situation
regarding the seas surrounding Taiwan and relevant policies.</P>
      <P>Shi pointed out that President Chen Shui-bian clearly outlined an
"ocean state" development blueprint when he took over the nation's
helm in 2000.</P>
      <P>"It is regrettable that the Executive Yuan, while drafting an
administration restructuring plan, dropped the proposal of creating
an ocean affairs ministry," Shi said.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that Taiwan's territorial waters cover a vast
expanse of 548,000 square kilometers, Shi said, Taiwan badly needs to
set up an ocean affairs ministry to handle issues related to its
territorial waters and its 200-mile exclusive economic zone.</P>
      <P>In his view, Shi said, the recent fishing dispute with Japan has
made more urgent the necessity of creating an ocean affairs ministry
to more efficiently deal with relevant affairs.</P>
      <P>"At the moment, ocean-related affairs, including fishing
disputes, are handled by a number of different government ministries
and agencies. None of those agencies give priority to ocean-related
affairs and as a result, we have been unable to tackle relevant
issues efficiently," Shi said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the sovereignty dispute with Japan over the
Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea, Shi said Taiwan also faces
many other ocean-related challenges, including the Chunxiao oil field
exploration disputes, the sovereignty dispute over the Nansha
(Spratly) Islands and Chinese research ships' frequent encroachment
upon waters surrounding the Taiwan-held Tungsha (Pratas) Islands in
the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>Shi said he hopes the Executive Yuan will reconsider its internal
restructuring plan and revive the plan to set up an ocean affairs
ministry to facilitate the development of Taiwan into an "ocean
state."</P>
      <P>The symposium was organized by the Ocean Business Research
Committee, an Executive Yuan ad hoc group, with the participation of
more than 200 government officials, international law experts,
academics and legislators.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. does not fear China and has no
intention of competing against China strategically, but it does hope
China will respect America's power and presence in Asia, U.S.
Under Secretary of State R. Nicholas Burns said in an interview
Saturday with a New Delhi newspaper.</P>
      <P>According to the pretext of the interview released by the State
Department Monday, Burns told India's Star News that China should
understand that the Asia-Pacific region has been secure, balanced and
peaceful for the better part of the last 50 years, partly because of
the positive influence of the United States and its military
deployments in the region.</P>
      <P>"There is no question that the great majority of Asian countries
want to see a continuation of American power and presence in the
region because we are a force for stability and for peace," Burns
said.</P>
      <P>The United States does compete with China economically, but is
otherwise seeking a peaceful relationship, Burns went on.</P>
      <P>He shrugged off the question of whether Indian and Japan could be
a counterbalance to China, saying that he cannot speak for the Indian
government, but adding that the United Sates and India have emerged
from a period when they held different views of the world and now
they have a greater confluence of interests, which makes it possible
for the emergence of a strategic partnership between them.</P>

visit to Washington by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government might authorize the
state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) to cooperate with China in
exploring for undersea oil in the East China Sea, providing it does
not provoke a dispute over sovereign rights, a CPC official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an symposium organized by the Ocean Business Research
Committee under the Executive Yuan to discuss the government's
strategy in managing the waters around Taiwan, Kung Hsiang-pang,
director of the CPC's undersea exploration department, said China is
contemplating exploring oil fields west of the median line of the
Taiwan Strait, either by itself or in collaboration with foreign oil
companies.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure its claim to at least a part of any possible
oil reserves in this area, Kung suggested that the government should
empower CPC -- which has accumulated a lot of experience in undersea
exploration -- to cooperate with China in exploring.</P>
      <P>Kung said the possibility for Taiwan to cooperate with Japan in
exploring oil fields in the East China Sea is slim in light of their
conflicting claims of exclusive economic zones.</P>
      <P>Noting that Japan has rejected Taiwan's claims by cooperating
with China in exploring oil in an area within Taiwan's exclusive
economic zone, Kung said Taiwan would compromise its claims if it

    <HEADLINE>WANG SAYS IT'S LOGICAL TO QUIT AS VICE CHAIRMAN IF HE LOSES ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday that it is logical to conclude that he would step down as
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) vice chairman if he were to lose the KMT
chairmanship election next month.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to questions on remarks a day earlier by Mu
Ming-chu, a former legislator who is serving as Wang's campaign aide,
while he was soliciting support in the southern county of Pingtung
for his bid for the KMT's top post.</P>
      <P>Mu said that if Wang is not elected party chairman, the KMT will
be "plunged into crisis" because Wang will no longer serve as a party
vice chairman and such issues as "pan-blue alliance" integration, the
party's controversial assets and party staff salaries will become
problems.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he has not yet thought about the issue of quitting
as vice chairman and still has to assess the matter, stressing
however that "Mu's speculation is reasonable."</P>
      <P>Wang noted that Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, another KMT vice
chairman and his rival in the July 16 chairmanship election,
has spoken about the generational transfer of power in the party
leadership.
</P>
      <P>Wang said that a man of his age should leave the party leadership
if he loses the election. Wang is 64 years old, and Ma is
55.</P>
      <P>Wang's campaign headquarters said, however, that Wang has a broad
mind and that he will work with Ma in whatever post he holds.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu set the tone for Wang's camp at a
press conference held at Wang's campaign headquarters in Taipei. Hung 
said that Mu's views are her "personal views, " adding that Wang has
served in the KMT for over 30 years and that he will continue to work
for the maximum interests of the party in whatever post he holds.</P>
      <P>"Both Wang and Ma are indispensable assets of the KMT, " Hung
said, adding that they should value each other's contribution to the
party.</P>
      <P>Hung said that Wang has every confidence in winning the election
and that he will continue to rely heavily on Ma to create a win-win
situation for the KMT and the nation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said he is sure that Wang loves the party and that
he won't quit as vice chairman even if he loses the election.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that he will quit along with incumbent KMT Chairman
Lien Chan after election.</P>
      <P>Ma said that if Wang wins the chairmanship election, "I will
support him in the interests of the party, " adding that "this is a
gentlemen's battle" and that both are comrades before the election
and should be so after the election. The mayor added that both he and
Wang agreed that the party can't afford to be split apart.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh promised Wednesday
there will not be water rate hike in the near term.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said during a weekly Cabinet meeting that the Cabinet will
first put forth a pricing formula and submit it to the Legislative
Yuan for approval before raising water rates.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet will also review the basic minimum charge for water
consumption to encourage people to cherish water resources.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the burden of many consumers will decrease if
the minimum charge is lowered as the amount of water consumed by
approximately 75 percent of users is lower than the minimum level.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he will request the water company to present an
analysis of its financial structure and review its pipe replacement
program, both of which he said will affect the water pricing.</P>
      <P>On energy rates, the premier said the government will respect the
market mechanism and take the country's economic and energy policies
into consideration before hiking energy rates.</P>
      <P>It will be unnecessary for the government to develop more energy
resources and generate more energy if people can conserve energy, he

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR SUPPORT FOR ARMS PROCUREMENT, VOLUNTEER MILITARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that Taiwan is now at a critical juncture of metamorphosis on many
fronts, including constitutional reform, detente across the Taiwan
Strait, diplomatic development and upgrading of national defense.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while addressing a commissioning ceremony
for 55 newly promoted generals and admirals.</P>
      <P>"Over the years of development, Taiwan has become a liberal
democracy. But it is now facing many new challenges, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>At this historical moment, the president went on, Taiwan must
establish an elite military force to guarantee a safe and stable
environment for constitutional reform, cross-strait detente, civic
participation in diplomatic affairs and refinement of defense
capabilities.</P>
      <P>As commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Chen said he wants to
join all service members in fulfilling the military's core values of
"sacrifice, unity and accountability" with "courage, conviction and
trust."</P>
      <P>Noting that the ultimate goal of Taiwan's military buildup is to
maintain a balance of military power with China, Chen said Taiwan
must establish an elite military force strong enough to deter any
invasion and fight back any possible attack from China.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Chen said, senior U.S. officials have on many
occasions expressed worries about China's rapid military expansion
and missile deployment. The soon-to-be-released Pentagon annual
defense white paper is also expected to mention U.S. concern about
China's growing military power.</P>
      <P>Chen said three weaponry systems his administration has proposed
to purchase from the United States -- eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft -- have been chosen after a
comprehensive professional assessment and extensive public debate.</P>
      <P>"We regret that the procurement plan has been excessively
politicized. With the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan refusing
even to put the procurement package into its work agenda, our
national defense network may have a loophole that could eventually
upset the military balance in the Taiwan Strait and the entire
Asia-Pacific region," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed hope that all military service personnel can stand
even more united and redouble their efforts to hone their combat
prowess to safeguard national security and cross-strait stability.</P>
      <P>With the evolution of modern warfare, he continued, Taiwan must
establish an all-volunteer military service system to upgrade the
quality of service members, enhance combat prowess and boost military
operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Noting that ever-more sophisticated weapons require trained
professionals to operate them, Chen said the military must step up
recruitment of volunteers so that these advanced weapons can be
operated appropriately and the weapons' efficacy reaches their
fullest potential. A volunteer service system is also expected to
increase job opportunities for young people, he added.</P>
      <P>While congratulating the new generals and admirals, Chen also
demanded that all senior officers further improve management
mechanisms and risk-reduction measures to minimize accidents and
casualties in military training programs and enhance safety in
military barracks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIAOYUTAIS BELONG TO ROC: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tiaoyutai island group is the territory
of the Republic of China no matter whether from the viewpoints of
geography, geology, history or international law, an official of a
local think tank claimed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Stephen S.F. Chen, convener of a national security group of the
National Policy Foundation, made the remarks when he reported on the
dispute surrounding the Tiaoyutais and protection of local
fishermen's rights to a regular meeting of the opposition Kuomintang
Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>The former representative to the United States claimed that since
the first generational transfer of power in Taiwan politics in 2000,
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, confined by its ideology and
election considerations, has had no comprehensive plan for the nation
and has failed to see the basic interests of the nation.</P>
      <P>Whether it is from the viewpoints of geography, geology, history
and international law, the Tiaoyutai island group belongs to Taiwan
and the government should insist on the sovereignty of the island
group, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais, known in Japan as the Senkakus, comprise eight
islets located northeast of Taiwan, about 102 nautical miles from the
northern port of Keelung. The islands, claimed by Taiwan, China and
Japan, are about 90 nautical miles from the nearest Taiwanese and
Japanese territory.</P>
      <P>Waters near the Tiaoyutais have been the source of a long-running
dispute between Taiwan and Japan, as they are located in the
overlapping exclusive economic zones of the two countries.</P>
      <P>Japan agreed to a new round of fishery talk July 29 after a mass
protest by Taiwan fishing vessels near the controversial waters in
northeastern Taiwan early this month.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that without sovereignty there can be no fishing
rights.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor and KMT Vice Chairman Ma Ying-jeou echoed
Chen's views, saying that the government should insist that fishing
rights and sovereignty are inseparable.</P>
      <P>Ma said that if the government shelves the dispute on sovereignty
and only talks about fishing rights in the upcoming fishery talks, it
will be detrimental to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should not unilaterally shelve the dispute on
sovereignty, pointing out that the island group has already been
occupied by Japan and that Taiwan's unilateral shelving would be
tantamount to giving up its sovereignty claim.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmaker claimed Wednesday that China's pressure was
behind a World Trade Organization (WTO) move to change Taiwan's
information in its new directory and he urged the opposition not to
blame the government.</P>
      <P>In the WTO directory renewed last week, Taiwan's WTO officials
are addressed as "Mr" and "Miss" instead of their official titles.</P>
      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Lai Hsin-yuan, who
is a former advisor to the National Security Council, accused
Taiwan's permanent mission to the WTO of failing to defend Taiwan's
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>She claimed Wednesday that the changes were the result of a
concession made by the permanent mission and she demanded that the
Cabinet punish the officials responsible and demand that the WTO
republish the directory.</P>
      <P>However, William C.T. Lai, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus,
said the allegation is totally untrue and will upset the morale of
Taiwan's WTO mission.</P>
      <P>He also called the opposition Kuomintang's and People First
Party's attention to the fact that China has not stopped oppressing
Taiwan internationally despite the recent visit to China by the two
parties' leaders, and urged the two parties to condemn China.</P>

prosecutors of an alleged insider trading of an official of the
Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), an Executive
Yuan spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai made the remarks one day after prosecutors searched

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu returned to
Taiwan Wednesday after concluding a visit to Palau that began Monday,
describing it as "a short but rich and fruitful trip."</P>
      <P>Although Lu said that her trip to the diplomatic ally in the
South Pacific was short -- a little more than 50 hours in total,
about one-third of which was spent at sea, she hailed it as "a lean
but beautiful diplomatic tour."</P>
      <P>Stating that she was deeply impressed by Palau's beautiful
scenery, Lu called on Taiwan tourists to pay more visits to the
island nation, which is an ideal destination for a wide variety of
water-based leisure activities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has a very similar natural environment to Palau and the
people in Taiwan should pay more attention to the sea that surrounds
the country as it wishes to become an ocean power, Lu said, pointing
out that long-term negligence by the government has made Taiwan lose
its oceanic characteristics.</P>
      <P>The recent fishery dispute between Taiwan and Japan is a clear
reflection of the importance for Taiwan to acknowledge itself as an
ocean country in order to protect the country's vital interests, she
said.</P>
      <P>Traveling at the head of an official delegation, the vice
president departed for Palau Monday for a three-day visit, during
which she met Palauan President Tommy Remengesau, Jr. and upper and
lower house speakers Johnny Reklai and Augustine Mesebeluu,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of Lu's visit was to take part in the
inauguration of a Taiwan-funded upscale hotel -- the Palau Royal
Resort Hotel, which is expected to create many job opportunities for
local people and bring in more foreign tourists.</P>

      <P>TACS was established in 2003 in response to the way Taiwan
lawmakers do not discuss major policy issues but simply engage in
partisan struggles, and the way the media do not do their jobs
professionally but rather just stage talks shows that serve only to
advance the interests of political hot-heads.</P>
      <P>"What the parliament and the media were doing did not help to
solve problems. Rather, they created factors for social division and

    <HEADLINE>INTER-PARTY MEETINGS URGED TO FORGE CONSENSUS ON CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A scholar urged the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition parties Wednesday to meet
regularly on national affairs and forge consensus on cross-Taiwan
Strait issues.</P>
      <P>Professor Chao Chien-min of National Chengchi University made the
remarks when he attended a seminar on the roles and functions of
Taiwan's political parties in promoting cross-strait exchanges. The
seminar was sponsored by the College of Social Sciences of National
Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>Professor Lin Cheng-yi of the same university said that with the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) heads
traveling to China over the past two months to have exchanges with
the Communist Party of China, there should be due division of work
and a notification mechanism so as "to assuage misgivings."</P>
      <P>Lin noted that a cross-strait peace alliance promoted by several
civic groups, such as the Peacetime Foundation of Taiwan, the Taiwan
Labor Front and the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, has called
on the government to convene national meetings on cross-strait
issues.</P>
      <P>Judging from Chinese President Hu Jintao's policy toward Taiwan,
Lin said that China would focus on trade and economy, culture and
education, as well as sports and tourism exchanges.</P>
      <P>All civic groups relevant to the above fields are China's
possible targets, Lin said, adding that the government should
integrate information and make it transparent.</P>
      <P>Noting that President Chen Shui-bian has announced that he will
invite opposition parties and representatives from all quarters to
convene a cross-strait peace development committee, Lin urged the
president to deliver on his promise or explain why he has failed to
deliver.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government supply information so that
Taiwan civic groups, when conducting exchanges with China, will have
a standard operating procedure or set of guidelines to follow.</P>
      <P>The government should also notify the opposition parties when
announcing major policies and step up communication beforehand so as
to form a unified team to negotiate with China, Lin said.</P>
      <P>NTU Professor Wu Yu-shan said that the "pan-green camp" of the
DPP and its ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union should reflect upon
themselves after Taiwan people "had not shown strong disapproval"
after the China visits by the KMT and PFP heads.</P>
      <P>This, he claimed, seems to show that seeking reconciliation with
Beijing has gained some legitimacy in Taiwan. He added that if the
trend continues, there might be an appeal for the "pan-green camp" to
become more hawkish and for the opposition "pan-blue alliance" to
become more dovish in dealing with cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>But he also warned the "pan-blue alliance" not to be too
optimistic, saying that it could harm itself if it overplays
cross-strait exchanges.</P>

they have considered starting their own business, and more than a
quarter of these have, an Internet poll showed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted jointly by Cheers magazine and
www.104boss.com.tw, said that among those who have the experience of
starting their own business, 60 percent began when they were between
20 and 29.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that among entrepreneurs, 69 percent failed,
but only 3.5 percent of them said they had given up the hope of being
their own boss, while 81 percent said they would look for another job
and build up momentum for a fresh start. Another 13 percent said that
they would persist until they succeed.</P>
      <P>Asked about problems starting their own business, 74 percent said
a lack of start-up money, 53 percent said they couldn't grasp the
direction of the business and which business to set up, while 25
percent said that they couldn't find suitable partners.</P>
      <P>The biggest hurdles in starting a new business, in order, are:
business direction, wrong business formula or wrong business (40.5
percent), unstable financial support (36.9 percent), and hard to find
clients (32 percent).</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the service sector has become the
mainstream of starting new businesses, while eateries are the
favorite among new businesses.</P>
      <P>The best timing of starting a business is five years after work,
while a starting fund of NT$500,000 (US$15,870) is most common, and
the daily needs of average people provide the optimal opportunity for
business starters.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted June 7-15, receiving 3,075 effective
samples.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'CHINA FEVER' AIMED AT ISOLATING TAIWAN GOVERNMENT: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The seemingly friendly "China fever"
created recently by Beijing is aimed at dividing the ruling and
opposition parties in Taiwan and isolating the government of Taiwan,
a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Yen Wan-chin said that China has
never stopped its international oppression of Taiwan or made
concessions on basic issues despite the friendly atmosphere shown in
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Yen was referring to the visits to China by members of Taiwan's
main opposition Kuomintang and People First Party at Beijing's
invitation over the past two months, which the media and politicians
claim has created what they describe as "China fever" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In what the DPP has called the latest example of China's
oppression of Taiwan, Beijing reportedly has pressured the World
Trade Organization (WTO) to omit the official titles of Taiwan
officials to the WTO in its new directory, giving them the honorifics
of simply "Mr." or "Ms."</P>
      <P>Yen said Beijing should open dialogue with the government if it
is truly friendly toward Taiwan and he urged the opposition parties
to meet with the ruling party to seek a consensus on divisive issues
before holding any talks with Beijing.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a seminar on the role and function of
opposition parties in promoting cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Also at the seminar, Chen Ming-tong, a professor at National
Taiwan University's Graduate Institute of National Development,
claimed that the problem of cross-strait exchanges always lies with
the Beijing side.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the recent "China fever" is built upon a
framework in which the opposition leaders who have visited China
recognize the so-called "1992 consensus" on the "one China" principle
and that this framework will become even firmer as such exchanges
increase.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, members of the opposition parties
should prioritize the overall interests of Taiwan over partisan
interests while engaging in exchange activities with China, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He called on the opposition parties to avoid distorting the
government's policies in exchange for partisan gains.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROPOSED REVISIONS TO THE REFERENDUM LAW APPROVED BY EXECUTIVE YUAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposal to revise the Referendum Law to
make it easier for the people to call for referendums and approve
them was approved by the Executive Yuan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Under the proposal, the scope of issues that can be put to a
referendum would be expanded to cover the sensitive issue of changing
the nation's territorial boundaries.</P>
      <P>Also, the number of voters needed to initiate a request for a
referendum would be lowered from 0.5 percent of the total eligible
voters in the last presidential election to 0.03 percent.</P>
      <P>The number of sponsors needed to second such a request would be
lowered from 5 percent of eligible voters in the last presidential
election to 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Except for the proposition to change the nation's boundaries,
which would have to be approved by half of all eligible voters, other
issues would need only one-quarter of eligible voters' approval,
according to the proposal.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's right to initiate referendums under the
current law will be shifted to the Executive Yuan; what is left for
the legislature is only the right to approve the Executive Yuan's
request for a referendum.</P>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) will substitute for the
Executive Yuan as the government agency in charge of referendums, and
the commission provided for in the current law to review people's
request for a referendum will be replaced by the CEC too.</P>
      <P>The proposed revisions will be presented to the legislature for
enactment in the next legislative session.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITRI SETS UP INCUBATION CENTER IN CALIFORNIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) recently opened a talent incubation center in
Silicon Valley, California, via its North American base -- ITRI
International Inc. -- to offer comprehensive services to people
interested in starting a new business.</P>
      <P>With abundant researchers and brilliant technical services to
corporations, ITRI's business incubation center in Hsinchu, northern
Taiwan, has been chosen as the best center of its kind in Asia by the
Asian Association of Business Incubation (AABI) this year.</P>
      <P>ITRI President Johnsee Lee said on his recent visit to the United
States that Taiwan can become a springboard for talented people in
Silicon Valley to enter the Asian market, and the newly established
North American incubation center can help such efforts.</P>
      <P>ITRI's incubation center in Silicon Valley will offer knowledge
on how to open a business, technical support and trade consulting
services to potential clients and help them promote the sales of
their products to the Asian and Pacific region.</P>
      <P>In addition to offering technical support to corporations, the
ITRI also badly needs high-tech experts from abroad.</P>
      <P>ITRI's talent-search program from abroad last year received a
warm response, and the organization will continue the program in
search of high-tech experts with more than five years' work
experience in North America.</P>
      <P>To strengthen Taiwan's competitiveness, Lee said he hoped that
ITRI International, Inc. can forge cooperative relations with noted
U.S. universities, research organizations and corporations.</P>
      <P>Currently, ITRI has long-term cooperative projects with Rockwell
Scientific, Co., Stanford University, the University of California
at Los Angeles, Corning and Dow Chemical, and has established
strategic alliances with SRI International, UC Berkeley, and Carnegie
Mellon University.</P>
      <P>In 2004, ITRI successfully introduced 211 U.S. patents related to
digital imaging ICs to Taiwan, ushering in an era of digital
television, LCD television and the digital imaging industry in
Taiwan, and the company will keep securing U.S. patents for Taiwan to

    <HEADLINE>INTERNAL CONSENSUS CRITICAL TO CROSS-STRAIT TIES: EX-MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must first forge a domestic
consensus on the nature and direction of cross-strait relations if
it hopes to have adequate room to deal with China, a former top
mainland policy-planner said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Ing-wen of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, who once served as Mainland Affairs Council chairwoman, made
the remarks in a keynote speech delivered at a seminar on the role
and functions of domestic political parties in promoting cross-strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>The seminar was organized by National Taiwan University's Social
Science College as the role of political parties in cross-strait ties
has come to the forefront after the controversial visits to China by
two opposition leaders -- Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People
First Party Chairman James Soong -- between late April and early May.</P>
      <P>Noting that local politicians like to treat cross-strait ties as
a stage for grandstanding based on their own ideologies and sense of
mission, Tsai said their political calculations have often hindered
them from addressing cross-strait issues squarely and logically.</P>
      <P>As a result, she said, politics has mingled with legal matters,
with politicians indulging themselves in seeking legal solutions to
intrinsically political events. At stake in such practices have been
the impartially and objectivity of the law.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties should think how
to integrate law and politics by laying out a comprehensive framework
within a legal basis for both camps to cooperate in cross-strait
policy formulation while leaving room for them to compete among
themselves. Only by so doing, Tsai said, can Taiwan present a unified
front in dealing with China or tackling external affairs.</P>
      <P>As far as cross-strait affairs are concerned, Tsai said the
government and all local political parties must take into account two
key points.</P>
      <P>First, Tsai said, local political parties must keep in mind that
the 23 million Taiwan people share a common destiny and therefore
should create a priority list for engagements with China, with the
common interests of all domestic parties superseding the common
interests of their own party and the Chinese Communist government in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>For the sake of maintaining national identity, Tsai went on, the
government should be given room to exercise its public authority in
cross-strait engagements, while local political parties and the
public should also have a say in cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Tsai outlined key obligations for political parties in engaging
China, including abiding by the law; being subject to a certain
degree of supervision; showing transparency in their engagements with
China; informing the public of the goals of their contacts and
exchange programs; and consulting and communicating with the
government on the conduct of their engagements.</P>
      <P>As the government monopolizes administrative power in
cross-strait affairs, Tsai said, it should also fulfill some
obligations, including professionalism, impartiality, non-partisan
thinking, avoiding arrogance, avoiding the abuse of power, taking the
initiative to consult and communicate with opposition parties and
expounding on its major policy goals and their legality to opposition
parties and the public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PREPARING FOR TALKS WITH CHINA ON FRUIT SALES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is preparing for talks with relevant
Chinese organizations about supplying Taiwanese fruits to the Chinese
market after a Beijing official indicated flexibility Wednesday on
which organization should represent Taiwan in this regard.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council in Beijing, Tang Wei, deputy chief of the Department of
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs of the Ministry of Commerce, said
that China is willing to discuss the importation of Taiwanese fruits
with any non-governmental organization that can truly represent the
interests of Taiwanese farmers and is familiar with Taiwan's fruit
trade.</P>
      <P>This is seen by Taiwan officials as the first indication that
Beijing is no longer opposed to Premier Frank Hsieh's suggestion that
Taiwan be represented by the unofficial foreign trade arm, the Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Tang's remarks are seen as having demonstrated considerable
flexibility, compared with those made by Li Weiyi, spokesman for the
State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office at a news conference on June
15. Although Li did not comment directly on Hsieh's proposal, he said
that Beijing has always considered trade and economic cooperation
with Taiwan an "internal affair" between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Last week a delegation of the Taiwan Provincial Farmers
Association visited China and discussed technical problems concerning
the sale of Taiwan fruits with the Cross-Strait Association of
Economy and Trade under the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. At the
time, Beijing appeared to prefer to deal with the association
directly.</P>
      <P>Senior officials of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Wednesday termed Beijing's recent statement a "positive response" and
called on both sides to begin talks as soon as possible. They also
said the MAC will consult with TAITRA and the Taiwan Provincial
Farmers Association on the next steps in the negotiation process with
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TAITRA Secretary-General Chao Yung-chuan said the
TAITRA representative in Beijing was trying to find out more about
Beijing's new gesture. He also said he expects TAITRA to be
designated by the MAC to be the organization responsible for sales of
top-quality Taiwan fruits to the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>China announced on May 3 that it would increase the number of
Taiwan fruit categories allowed for import to China from 12 to 18,
and grant tariff-free treatment for 15 categories.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A key official of the pro-independence
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) resigned Wednesday for touting the idea
that the party should engage in talks with China, contradicting the
party line of never making contact with China unless it recognizes
Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Lee Hsien-jen, chief executive officer of the TSU's Policy
Council, tendered his resignation after his proposal to begin
discussions with China backfired. His resignation was accepted by the
party's Central Committee, TSU Secretary-General Cheng Chen-lung
said.</P>
      <P>In a statement, the party said it has never changed its policy of
insisting on and safeguarding Taiwan's independent sovereignty.</P>
      <P>It compared recent visits to China by major opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong to
"kowtowing to Beijing." It said it will never fall into the trap of
China's united front that Lien and Soong had helped to set up.</P>
      <P>It also admonished party members not to go against the party's
"Taiwan identity above all" policy and contact China, and threatened
to discipline or expel those who violate the policy. However, it is
acceptable for party members to visit China as tourists.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the latest information shows that none of the TSU's 12
legislators has invested in China, adding that anyone found to have
done so will be disciplined.</P>

      <P>News reports that Taiwanese singer Yu
Tien's adopted younger brother has been executed in China on charges
of narcotics trafficking are incorrect, a spokesman for the Chinese
government said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Li Weiyi, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council, told a regular news conference that Yu Fu-hsing, charged
with smuggling heroin into Xiamen, is still awaiting trial at the
highest People's Court in Fujian.</P>
      <P>Li said court trials are very serious matters. He deplored the
fact that incorrect news reports have misled people and caused
distress to the family members of the defendant. However, he declined
to disclose the whereabouts of the accused and his present condition.</P>
      <P>Over the past few days, news media in Taiwan has widely reported
that popular singer Yu Tien's 49-year-old younger brother, Yu
Fu-hsing, who moved to Xiamen 12 years ago, had been executed with a
number of other drug traffickers by lethal injection on June 26 by
Chinese authorities for smuggling heroin into China from Thailand.</P>
      <P>The news originated from reports in Hong Kong newspapers, which
said that Yu Fu-hsiung had been sentenced to death in March for
carrying 10 bricks of heroin totaling 3.8 kilograms worth about
NT$100 million in street value.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY DELEGATION TO VISIT CHINA NEXT WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A New Party delegation is slated to embark
on an eight-day visit to China July 6, New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming
announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the New Party headquarters in Taipei, Yok said that
he will personally lead the 30-member mission to China via Hong Kong,
where they will make stops in Guangzhou, Nanjing, Dalian and Beijing
through a stay until July 13.</P>
      <P>The New Party is a small party with only a single legislator in
the 225-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the visit is to step up bilateral exchanges
and mutual communication between Taiwan and China, seeing as both
places are members of the global Chinese society, and to mark the
60th anniversary of China's victory over the Japanese in 1945 at the
end of World War Two, Yok said.</P>
      <P>The New Party delegation's visit to China will be the third by a
political party from Taiwan since April this year following a
"journey of peace" by main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan and a "bridge-building" trip by People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>The New Party delegation will be accorded with the same protocol
by the Chinese side as is accorded by China to the KMT and the PFP,
Yok added.</P>
      <P>The KMT, the PFP and the New Party form the pro-unification "pan
blue alliance" to counter the pro-independence "pan green" camp of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP Secretary-General Chin Ching-sheng told a seminar
on the roles of political parties in cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges
held at National Taiwan University that Taiwan-China interactions are
unstoppable trends and he urged the government to go with the flow
created by opposition parties instead of just sitting idly by.</P>
      <P>The governing DPP must forswear ideological strife and lean
toward moderation for the sake of the people's benefit, Chin said,
stressing that PFP Chairman Soong goodwill visit to China in early
May helped lay the foundation for the two sides to improve their
strained ties on a wide range of fronts.</P>
      <P>A capable and visionary government should have the wisdom and
courage to use Taiwan's links with China to its advantage to pursue
benefits for the country, rather than viewing them as threats, he
said, calling on the government to seize all available opportunities
to mend relations and forge rapport with China.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, a former vice chairman of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council, suggested that the government bravely take
on the challenges from China with effective strategies to counter
what it calls the "united fronts" of the Chinese Communists.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same seminar, Chang Wu-ueh, a professor of China
studies at Tamkang University, warned that Beijing is attempting to
extend its clout into Taiwan's political spectrum by pushing for
party-to-party contacts with Taiwan's opposition parties.</P>
      <P>He urged both the ruling and opposition camps to ponder in depth
through dialogue how to face Beijing's offensive at a time when the
Chinese Communist regime crowds out the ruling DPP in bilateral

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said in a recent
interview with a U.S. press group that the United States should
invite President Chen Shui-bian and herself to visit Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Lu gave the interview with Tim Johnson, Beijing bureau chief of
the Knight Ridder press group, at the Presidential Office June 24.
The San Jose Mercury News, a Knight Ridder newspaper based in
California, published the interview in its June 28 issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that both the late Palestinian Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat and the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the
Dalai Lama had been invited to visit the White House, Lu said in the
interview that President Chen and she are even more qualified to be
invited to visit the U.S. capital because they have dedicated
themselves to promoting freedom, democracy, human rights and peace
for many years.</P>
      <P>The San Jose Mercury News published the interview with Lu Tuesday
under the title "Vice President Defends Taiwan." The article, carried
on the paper's Asian news page, had a photo of Lu sitting in her
office before her life-size portrait.</P>
      <P>Lu said in the interview that she doesn't see any chance or
reason for Taiwan to become a part of the People's Republic of China
in the foreseeable future. She further said she thinks Chinese
leaders do not want to have a war with Taiwan before 2008 because
they must focus efforts on preparing for the 2008 Beijing Olympic
Games.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, Lu said Taiwan business people have set up
thousands of factories in southern and central China to cash in on
cheap labor there. Lu said she is worried about the situation. In her
view, Lu said China has to some extent succeeded in enticing
Taiwanese business people to invest and settle on the Chinese
mainland.</P>
      <P>Lu said she earnestly hopes that the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan can pass as soon as possible a bill aimed at
punishing Taiwan business people who leak highly sensitive technical
expertise to China.</P>
      <P>Asked if she would seek the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
nomination for the 2008 presidential election, Lu didn't give a
direct reply. She instead said more and more people like her because
of her straightforward, frank and principled character.</P>
      <P>The Knight Ridder group, the second-largest newspaper publisher
in the United States, operates 31 dailies, with 14 ranking among the

      <P>The number of abused children and teenagers
in Taiwan has fallen, in contrast to a media report that claimed that
the number has jumped by almost 1.5-fold in just a year, a spokesman
for the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman asked the China Time Express to make a correction
of its report printed earlier the same day that says the number of
abused children in Taiwan rose quickly to 7,837 for 2004 from the
2003 level of 5,349 -- a 1.47-fold increase.</P>
      <P>The numbers cited by the newspaper are wrong and it should
correct the report to reflect the facts, the MOI official said,
elaborating that the 2004 number was 7,837 -- 5,796 abused children
and 2,041 teenagers -- in comparison to the 2003 figure of 8,013 --
5,349 children and 2,664 teenaged youths.</P>
      <P>To prevent such cases from happening in society, local
governments, law enforcement authorities and private sector groups
have set up round-the-clock telephone lines to provide necessary aid,
assistance and shelter to abused children -- mainly victims of
domestic violence, the official said, pointing out that parents,
adoptive fathers and mothers, relatives and family friends are the
most frequent abusers.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties must
reconcile and dialogue with each other and forge a consensus on how
to cope with China's ever more adroit strategies toward Taiwan, a
scholar said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-yueh, a Tamkang University associate professor, made the

political parties in promoting exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.
The issue has come to the forefront after two Taiwan opposition

authorities to directly influence Taiwan's domestic affairs and
electoral results, Chang said local ruling and opposition parties
must seek reconciliation and work out viable strategies to cope with
this new situation.</P>
      <P>"Ruling and opposition parties must consider how they can work
together to avert Chinese influence in domestic affairs while
competing among themselves for popular support in political
elections. If ruling and opposition camps cannot cooperate, they
would be unable to present a unified front to pursue national and
popular interests," Chang said.</P>
      <P>With party-to-party exchanges across the Taiwan Strait continuing
gaining momentum, Chang said domestic inter-party reconciliation has
become ever more urgent.</P>
      <P>Chang said he sees no reason for the KMT to refuse to reconcile
with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) now that it has
forsaken its 80-year feud to reconcile with the CPC.</P>
      <P>"As to the DPP, if it cannot reconcile with the KMT, how can it
convince us that it can promote reconciliation and dialogue with
China?" Chang said.</P>
      <P>He further said Beijing should develop contact and dialogue with
the DPP administration after it forged ties with the KMT and the PFP.
"Otherwise, how can it promote peaceful development in bilateral
ties?" he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION CRITICIZES GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL TO REVISE REFERENDUM LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's proposal to revise the
Referendum Law was welcomed by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) but drew brickbats from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) on whose ideas the current law was
crafted.</P>
      <P>Speaking for the KMT caucus at the Legislative Yuan, Legislator
Huang Teh-fu said the DPP government is trying to cut the
legislature's power by doing away with its right to initiate
referendums because the DPP failed to win a majority in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>By taking away from the Legislative Yuan the right to initiate
referendums and giving it to the Executive Yuan, the proposal runs
against the basic principle that referendums are a device created to
address problems caused by the executive branch's failure to enact
proper laws and thereby should reside with the legislature.</P>
      <P>He blamed the Executive Yuan for wanting to lower the minimum
number of voters needed to make a request for a referendum, to second
the request and to approve issues via for referendum simply because
President Chen Shui-bian's 2004 referendum was a failure.</P>
      <P>However, by making it easier to have recourse to referendums,
Huang argued, the Executive Yuan is opening the door to political
disturbance and compromising stability.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Chen Chih-pin shared the KMT's view, claiming that
referendums are supposed to be a right of the people, but the
proposed revision would turn them into the right of the government by
giving the Executive Yuan rather than the legislature the power to
initiate them.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chen Chih-pin said, the Central Election Commission
is responsible for the organization of elections for public
officials, which is quite different from referendums, and can't
replace the referendum reviewing commission that would be established
to review whether the request for a referendum is legal.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-pin said his party doesn't agree with the Executive
Yuan's proposal to eliminate the referendum reviewing commission
provided for in the current law.</P>
      <P>On the other end of the political spectrum, the ruling DPP and
its political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , lauded the
proposal as a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator William Lai, who is the whip of the DPP caucus at
the Legislative Yuan, said the existing Referendum Law is riddled
with so many restrictions that it is almost impractical.</P>
      <P>Instead of giving people the right to referendums, Lai claimed
the law has virtually denied people the right.</P>
      <P>TSU convener at the legislature Mark Ho said his party welcomes
the Executive Yuan's proposal.</P>
      <P>As an inherent right of the people, the fewer restrictions
that are imposed on bringing about a referendum the better, Ho said.</P>
      <P>He urged the KMT and PFP to uphold the proposal, which he said
will solidify the country's democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GRAND JUSTICES REVIEW FINGERPRINTING CONSTITUTIONALITY REQUEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices convened a
meeting Thursday to review a constitutional interpretation request
filed by the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) to have the fingerprinting provision in the Household
Registration Law invalidated.</P>
      <P>Article 8 of the law stipulates that people claiming new national
identification cards must be fingerprinted, which critics say
encroaches upon their basic human rights.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Gao Jyh-peng spoke of the gist of the request
shortly after the meeting started at 9 a.m. Hsieh Ai-ling, head of
the Population Administration of the Ministry of the Interior,
officials from related government agencies, as well as experts and
scholars also attended the meeting which lasted until noon.</P>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices will continue to review the matter
Friday.</P>
      <P>Gao said after reporting to the Council of Grand Justices that a
majority of people support fingerprinting, which he said reflects "a
failure of human rights education."</P>
      <P>He equated fingerprinting to strip searches, saying that the
policy is akin to treating everyone like a crime suspect. He added
that fingerprinting violates the people's inalienable right to
privacy.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker also said that if the government is allowed to use
social order as an excuse to strip the people of their rights, then
there is nothing stopping it from using other national security
reasons to encroach upon the people's rights.</P>
      <P>The government originally planned to require people to be
fingerprinted when they apply for the new national identification
card which is set to be issued from July 1.</P>
      <P>On May 30, the DPP filed the constitutional interpretation
request after human rights groups expressed concerns with the
fingerprinting policy.</P>
      <P>In view of the limited time available, the council on June 10
ordered a moratorium on the policy until it releases its
interpretation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan pointed out
Thursday that even Western countries which champion human rights have
begun to reconsider their stance on fingerprinting.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks on the sidelines of an award presentation
ceremony as the Council of Grand Justices began earlier in the day to
review a constitutional interpretation request filed by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to have the fingerprinting
provision in the Household Registration Law invalidated because of
concerns that it violates human rights.</P>
      <P>The ministry had planned to require that people be
fingerprinted when claiming the new version of the national
identification card originally set to begin to be issued from the
start of July. However, after the legislative caucus of the DPP
requested an interpretation May 30, the Council of Grand Justices on
June 10 placed a moratorium on the policy until it reviews the
request and releases its interpretation.</P>

policy, Su said, the ministry hopes the grand justices will give a

includes a fingerprinting requirement recently passed its second

country noted for championing human rights, is rethinking its policy
on fingerprinting.</P>
      <P>In addition, the United States now requires arriving visitors to
be fingerprinted, Su said, adding that many people who oppose
fingerprinting in Taiwan comply with the fingerprinting regulation
when traveling to the United States. These people are adopting a
"double standard," he said.</P>
      <P>As many industrial countries are now changing their policies on
fingerprinting to protect the security of the people and the nation,
Su urged the Taiwan people think about whether Taiwan, faced with a
growing number of mainland Chinese and Southeast Asian immigrants,
should maintain the fingerprint requirement.</P>
      <P>"The concept of human rights changes, and we need to carefully
consider whether sticking to the old human rights standards will lead
to social disorder," Su said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC DISCUSSIONS CAN BRIDGE CROSS-STRAIT GULF: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 30 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait could consult more
with each other over economic matters, a move that would increase
mutual trust and create conditions for political reconciliation.</P>
      <P>"Insisting on cross-strait rapprochement" was one of three
"insistences" that he said were his government's top priorities. The
other two were insisting on constitutional reform and insisting on
fairness and justice.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statements while speaking at the opening ceremony
of an Executive Yuan training session attended by officials groomed
for future promotions. One session was dedicated to training women.</P>
      <P>He said there is little likelihood of a breakthrough in
cross-strait political relations. However, improvements can be made
in economic affairs such as direct flights of cargo airplanes,
opening up Taiwan's tourism market to Chinese visitors, and fishery
and agricultural cooperation, he added.</P>
      <P>If the governments on the two sides of the Strait can talk about
expanding current exchanges and thereby accumulate mutual trust, it
will create favorable conditions for eventual political
reconciliation, he said.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that exchanges between people on both
sides of the Strait have developed into "extremely close" ties that
will be "highly valuable and significant" for the development of
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>He hoped efforts will be made to resume cross-strait dialogue
because, he said, only through dialogue can both side narrow their
gap and lay a solid foundation for building mutual confidence.</P>
      <P>While seeking dialogue and rapprochement with China, he stressed
that the government will never change its "pragmatic and rational"
policy of upholding Taiwan's national sovereignty and insisting on
Taiwan's national identity.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that since the first-phase of constitutional
reform has been completed, the second phase will deal with such
critical issues as adopting a three-branch or five-branch government,
and choosing a presidential or cabinet system.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on his idea of reform, he said the country should
insist on rectifying all political, judicial, educational, financial,
social and media abnormalities.</P>
      <P>"This is what the people have been expecting, and this will
enable our next generation to live in a 'fair and just new Taiwan'
where social justice, economic justice, judicial justice, sexual
justice and international justice will prevail," he said.</P>
      <P>He vowed that the government will not forget to assist the less
privileged while it seeks economic development and works to enhance
national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The people are also eagerly expecting Taiwan to shed political
polarization that has seen their society divided along the "blue" and
"green" lines as ruling and opposition politicians waste their
energies in endless confrontation, said the president.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the ruling and opposition parties engage in
"fair competition featuring cooperation, not confrontation," and work
to "monitor each other in a check and balance that brings unity, not
a war of attrition."</P>
      <P>Taiwan must stop wasting its energy and sapping its vitality
through social polarization and political confrontation; it must
forge ahead for justice and democracy, he asserted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT'S REQUEST TO DISBAND MEDIA MONITORING GROUP 'OUTRAGEOUS': DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Thursday termed a request by the
legislative caucus of the Kuomintang (KMT) to disband a media
monitoring group as "outrageous."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim was responding to the opposition
party's request that the government should disband such groups as the
Taiwan Advertisers' Association and another alliance to monitor the
media, calling them "hitmen" for the ruling party. The KMT also urged
the DPP to keep its hand out of the media.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said that the KMT had the media firmly in its grip through
its party-run enterprises while in power, and that it thinks the DPP
is doing the same.</P>
      <P>She said that the civic groups are offering their views on media
direction out of their free will and it is "unfair" that they be
accused of being "unfair" by the KMT.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the KMT said the number and size of the
media should be decided by free competition of market forces and
political forces shouldn't meddle with media development.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus said the "cutting electronic media by half" drive
launched by some civic groups is an attempt to stifle freedom of
speech under the name of media reform, noting that Lin Yu-huei, chief
executive officer of the media monitoring alliance served as the vice
director of the DPP's department on ethnic affairs before and the
alliance has long been regarded as a pro-DPP group.</P>
      <P>The media monitoring group as well as other groups called on the
Government Information Office (GIO) Wednesday, asking it to show its
resolve and be stringent in renewing the licenses of cable TV
stations to "phase out" media of lower quality.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, a DPP
ally, said that it supports news freedom, but the media should also
possess self-discipline. Mark Ho, TSU whip in the legislature, said
that it is a fact that media lately has been awash with sensational
and violent news. The party understands the worries by some civic
groups, but this still should not warrant an "exit of the media."</P>
      <P>He suggested that the media and the GIO meet to thrash out
self-disciple guidelines to facilitate regulations by the GIO.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian announced Thursday
that the first television station for aborigines in Taiwan and in

      <P>In the newest edition of the president's electronic paper, Chen
recalled that on July 1, 2003 he attended the opening ceremony of the

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 30 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Thursday called on
the people to "switch off and save, " saying that if each citizen
saves one unit of electricity a day, Taiwan could save NT$21 billion
(US$670 million) in electricity spending every year.</P>
      <P>Facing public concerns over possible hikes in the rates of water
and electricity due to surging international crude oil prices, Chen
said that he has ordered the Presidential Office management unit to
map out energy-saving measures, while he and his family will also
economize.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in the latest issue of his "A-Bian e-news."
He said he supports an energy-saving campaign, called "switching off
on the summer solstice, " which was recently launched by two private
non-profit organizations, the Society of Wildness and the Delta
Electronics Foundation, at Taipei's Da-an Forest Park.</P>
      <P>The president said that the campaign is not about how much time a
household turns off the lights a day, but is aimed to convince people
to really implement the idea of environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Saving energy can be achieved anywhere and anytime if people
adopt good habits, Chen said, noting that under the current global
consumption of energy, the world's crude oil reserves can only supply
41 years of worldwide demand, while it is expected that the Earth's
environment will be further damaged under the greenhouse effect
caused by fuel burning and air pollution.</P>
      <P>It's especially important for Taiwan to lower its consumption of
energy, given the fact that over 97 percent of Taiwan's energy is
imported from foreign markets, the president said.</P>

also makes a war unlikely across the Taiwan Strait, he said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday he

    <HEADLINE>DPP STANDS BY REVISING REFERENDUM LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's approval to amend the
Referendum Law will greatly improve the government's policy-making
quality and its competitiveness, an official of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang made the remarks at the party's
headquarters in a display of support for the Executive Yuan's
proposed amendments to the Referendum Law that must be submitted to
the Legislative Yuan for final approval.</P>
      <P>In a bid to dispel outside misgivings that a more liberal
Referendum Law will invite moves from the ruling DPP to initiate
public referendums on sensitive national sovereignty issues, such as
changes to the country's territory or official title, Lee gave his
assurance that no politically delicate issues will be included in a
second round of constitutional revisions.</P>
      <P>Responding to the opposition camp's accusation that a less rigid
Referendum Law will help create political unrest at home, Lee called
such rhetoric a mistrust of the people of Taiwan and the country's
democratic system.</P>
      <P>As a full-fledged democracy, Taiwan is capable of holding public
referendums to allow its people to exercise their mandate -- an
important step to implement public mandate in a democratic country,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>The current Referendum Law, which was passed by the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan, is a "bird cage" law which
strictly restricts the public's power regarding referendums.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan gave the green light Wednesday to a Referendum
Law amendment draft bill, which proposes to significantly lower the
threshold for calling, endorsing and approving a referendum by the
public and scrapping the rule requesting the establishment of a
referendum reviewing commission at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Caucus members of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) called a
news conference earlier the same day to voice their disagreement of
the Executive Yuan's Public Referendum revisions proposal, attacking
the governing DPP for plotting to shift public attention from its
failure in reviving the economy to boost its chances in December's
city mayor and county magistrate elections by throwing out the issue.</P>
      <P>According to KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao, President Chen
Shui-bian and the Executive Yuan raised the issue during the current
adjournment of the Legislative Yuan mainly to campaign for the DPP in
the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Lai claimed that the DPP wants to hollow out the power of the
Legislative Yuan with the proposal, which, if approved, would permit
a small number of the public to call referendums to give a final say
on issues that fail to pass the legislature.</P>
      <P>Such a situation would fan Taiwan's political wrangling polarized
by pro-unification "pan blue" and pro-independence "pan green"
backers, Lai predicted, warning that political instability will scare
away foreign investors and lead to an economic downfall.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Fei Hrong-tai said that the Cabinet's proposal to
amend the Public Referendum Law is just a DPP campaign scheme.</P>
      <P>It would create a fresh spat of crisis across the Taiwan Strait
if the DPP attempts to alter the country's territory and official
designation stipulated in the Republic of China Constitution, Fei
added, asserting that KMT lawmakers will undoubtedly do their best to
kill the Executive Yuan's draft bill at the legislature.</P>
      <P>In the face of strong criticism from the opposition camp, Premier
Frank Hsieh claimed that the Cabinet's proposal to revise the
existing Referendum Law is solely to respond to public expectations.</P>
      <P>Although everyone has a different view of the issue, Hsieh said
that an amended law will serve both the ruling and opposition parties
in the future, as it also will be easier for an opposition party to
initiate a referendum.</P>
      <P>The Referendum Law is meaningless should it impose thresholds
that are too high for a public referendum to be passed, the premier
said.</P>

originally conducting mainly via the dispatch of medical teams to
provide medical services to local people.</P>
      <P>However, the focus of the aid is gradually shifting toward
training local medical personnel and offering suggestions to improve
public health policies of the African nations, Chen said.</P>
      <P>For example, Chen said, every year, Taiwan helps train five
medical doctors in Malawi and provide scholarships to five to 10
Malawian doctors to study in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan has since last July provided free out-patient
services to HIV/AIDS patients in Malawi, where an estimated 8 percent
of the population have contracted the disease, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will present
what it considers as more effective measures to prevent the spread of
AIDS Saturday, as the fatal disease is spreading rapidly in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The plan will be presented in accordance with the convening of
the 7th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific in
Kobe, Japan, July 1-5.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai Shu-feng, section chief of the health
department in charge of AIDS prevention, the plan will focus on
needle-exchange program, and replacing drug addiction by other less
toxic medicines.</P>
      <P>Chen Cheng-hue, a nurse from National Cheng Kung University
Hospital, noted in her report that intravenous injection has become a
factor in the rapid spread of AIDS during the last few years, citing
the example of Nepal, in which the ratio of AIDS patients among drug
addicts has risen from less than 2 percent in 1990 to 68 percent in
2003.</P>
      <P>"The situation is more evident in southern Taiwan, and no one
knows why," Chen added.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from the health department's Center for
Disease Control (CDC) , the ratio of AIDS transmissions among
intravenous drug users in Taiwan surged to 16 percent in May this year
from 2 percent in the past.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Szu-min, a doctor from National Taiwan University Hospital,
noted that a campaign focusing on "preventing AIDS with condoms"
promoted by the government in the past has been so successful that
drug addicts practice safe sex, but are careless with their drug
habits.</P>
      <P>In addition to the health department's prevention measures, the
CDC also urged non-governmental organizations to promote AIDS
prevention education among the public.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Morgan Stanley Plans to
Rehire Its Former President.

The board of Morgan Stanley is expected to meet Thursday and
elect John J. Mack, a former president of the firm, as its chairman
and chief executive, succeeding Philip J. Purcell, the man who forced
him out in a bitter power struggle in 2001. For Mack, 60, who drove
the 1997 merger with Purcell and Dean Witter, his return is also a
resounding victory for the Morgan Stanley bankers and traders whose
revolt against Purcell's leadership this spring forced a recalcitrant
Morgan Stanley board to abandon its longstanding support of Purcell.
While a last-minute reversal is always possible, it is widely
expected that the board will support Mack four years after his
unceremonious departure.

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CONGRATULATES NEW HK CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian congratulated new
Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang Thursday, saying he hopes
Tsang can continue to promote Hong Kong-Taiwan exchanges in addition
to boosting the well-being of Hong Kong's 6.8 million residents.</P>
      <P>Chen extended his congratulations while meeting with a delegation
from the Hong Kong-based Taiwan Commerce and Industry Association.</P>
      <P>Noting that Hong Kong is an extremely important entrepot in trade
and personnel exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, Chen said forging a
constructive relationship will benefit not only Taiwan and Hong Kong
but will also help promote normalization of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Besides expecting Tsang to deliver on his promise to defend the
basic rights and interests of the 6.8 million Hong Kong citizens,
Chen said he looks forward to see Tsang take steps to increase
engagements with Taiwan, promote constructive Taiwan-Hong Kong-China
interaction and ensure peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the eighth anniversary of Hong Kong's return to
Chinese rule, Chen lamented that Hong Kong is one of the few areas in
the world to have seen a serious retreat in protection of personal
freedom and rule of law.</P>
      <P>"Since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in
1997, Beijing has played a big role in Hong Kong affairs, despite its
promise to allow Hong Kong to enjoy a wide-degree of autonomy under a
'one country, two systems' formula," Chen said.</P>
      <P>At least 163 cases involving Chinese government's encroachment
upon Hong Kong's autonomy, judicial independence and freedom of
speech have been reported over the past eight years, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In the past year alone, Chen said, the Chinese government has
repeatedly vetoed Hong Kong people's appeal for direct election of
their chief executive and legislators, dictated the schedule for Hong
Kong's political reform and grossly intervened in the Hong Kong
legislative council elections and the by-election of its chief
executive.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that a Hong Kong talk show host was forced to stop
comments on political events under Beijing's pressure and that a Hong
Kong-born correspondent of a Singaporean newspaper was arrested in
Beijing earlier this year on charges of spying. All these incidents
have caused concern in the world community, he added.</P>
      <P>Tsang, a popular career civil servant who last week assumed the
title of chief executive -- Hong Kong's highest political post -- in
a ceremony held in Beijing, will serve out the tenure left vacant by
Tung Chee-hwa, who quit in March this year citing fatigue and failing
health, although it is widely believed that was just an excuse and
that the unpopular Tung was simply dumped by his puppet masters in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Thanks to Beijing's gross intervention, only Tsang registered for
the chief executive by-election and consequently, there was no vote
by the 800-member electoral college.</P>
      <P>"In the process of the by-election, the 6.8 million Hong Kong
residents were deprived of their most basic political rights. It is
sad and regrettable that an ultra-modern and prosperous society like
Hong Kong has been handcuffed with a medieval despotic political
system," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In the past, Tung took his oath of office in Hong Kong. This time
around, Tsang was sworn in inside the People's Great Hall in Beijing.
"The change is yet another sign of the decline in Hong Kong's
autonomy and separate identity," Chen said.</P>
      <P>If China cannot embrace freedom and democracy and accelerate its
political reform, Chen said, Hong Kong's development will definitely
be restricted. Whether China can maintain its current pace of
economic growth will also be in doubt, he added.</P>
      <P>Given Hong Kong's important intermediary role in cross-strait
relations, Chen went on, his administration will continue keeping a
close watch on its democratic development and expanding services to
Taiwan expatriates there.</P>
      <P>Judging from Hong Kong's fate in the past eight years, Chen said
Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula is mere hot air.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that 'one county' is real, but 'two systems'
is false. Hong Kong's example can serve as a reminder to peace- and
democracy-loving people around the world. Taiwan must learn a lesson
from it. We must make every possible effort to avert such a sad
experience for the 23 million Taiwan people," Chen added.</P>

      <P>The Canadian Trade Office
in Taipei (CTOT) kicked off a series of activities in Taichung
Thursday with a lobster festival to celebrate Canada's 138th
birthday, which falls on July 1.</P>
      <P>The CTOT is hosting the events in partnership with the Taichung
city government and various partners around the country.</P>
      <P>On Canada Day, the CTOT will offer information and services
on-site in Taichung to "strengthen Canada's relationship in central
Taiwan with the public, the business community and Canadian
citizens," according to a CTOT official.</P>
      <P>"We have in recent years developed a tradition of celebrating
Canada Day outside of Taipei. Dubbed the 'Canada Day Road Show',
we've found it's an effective way to reach out to Taiwanese people
around the island, " said Gordon Houlden, executive director of the
CTOT.</P>
      <P>Houlden said the CTOT received an enthusiastic welcome from
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and the business community, and added that
"we wish to recognize the Canadian community in central Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He will host a Canada Day gala luncheon and Canadian Ginseng
Festival featuring North American ginseng, of which Canada is the
world's largest supplier, producing about 60 percent of the global
supply.</P>
      <P>The CTOT will also host the Canadian Technology and Investment
Seminar: Go North! The seminar is co-hosted by the Central Taiwan
Science Park and the Economic Bureau of the Taichung city government,
aiming to provide Taiwan companies with information they need to
evaluate business collaboration opportunities outside of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As Canada is the 3rd-largest car exporter in the world after the
United States and Japan and has one of the fastest-growing automotive
research, development and testing sectors in the global automotive
sector, the seminar is expected to draw quite a number of interested
investors.</P>
      <P>A seminar on Canadian Design Excellence in Green Building will
also be held, featuring experts from Canadian companies, the CTOT and
the Chinese Architecture and Building Center (CABC) . The seminar,
supported by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, will
profile Canadian capability in sustainable development initiatives,
green building techniques and compliance with mandatory green
building design criteria introduced in Taiwan in 2002.</P>
      <P>Special to the 2005 Canada Day celebration is an expanded
gathering of Canadian studies scholars from around Taiwan, coinciding
with the establishment of the Canadian Studies Association and the
annual Canadian Studies 2005 Scholarship Award Reception.</P>
      <P>On July 2, there will be a charity premiere of the Canadian film
"The Blue Butterfly, " to which some 200 minority children, those
suffering from rare diseases and young cancer patients have been

    <TEXT>
      <P>Diplomatic relations between the Republic
of China and the Vatican are stable and reports of the possibility of
official ties between China and the Holy See are just a Chinese plot
to ruin ROC-Vatican ties, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official claimed Thursday.</P>
      <P>MOFA Spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks following reports that
China's newly appointed auxiliary bishop for Shanghai has gained
recognition from the Vatican.</P>
      <P>Officials from Chinese churches said this is an "active signal"
for a step forward in China-Vatican relations, as it is the first
time that both the Chinese communist government and the Holy See have
tacitly agreed the appointment of the country's top church post.</P>
      <P>Although Liu Bonian, an official at the state-approved Chinese
Catholic Patriotic Association, admitted that the appointment has
been made in accordance with Chinese procedure, he claimed that the
recognition from the Vatican represents "a step forward."</P>
      <P>Some Chinese church leaders have expressed hope that the
appointment can help achieve reconciliation between the Chinese
government and the Holy See.</P>
      <P>China has no diplomatic relations with the Holy See and has
rejected the pope's authority to appoint bishops.</P>
      <P>Lu said official ties between the ROC and the Vatican have had
many complications during the last three decades. However, the ties
have remained stable despite Chinese interference.</P>
      <P>China has demanded that the Vatican sever its formal relations
with Taiwan in exchange for the setting up of officials ties.</P>
      <P>"We don't think China will allow religious freedom in the
foreseeable future and we believe that the Vatican is chiefly
concerned with religious freedom and the numerous Catholics in China,

    <HEADLINE>FISHERMEN PLAN TO STAGE PROTESTS AT JIA OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fishermen in the northeastern county of
Ilan plan to organize a protest at Japan's de facto embassy in Taipei
July 7 over the Japanese coast guard's frequent disturbance of their
operations in waters off northeastern Taiwan, fishery sources said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Suao fishermen said they will invite their counterparts in other
parts of the country to join the protest at the Taipei office of the
Japanese Interchange Association (JIA), a quasi-official organization
authorized to handle exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of official
ties.</P>
      <P>Following their planned protest at the JIA, the fishermen also
plan to file a petition with the Executive Yuan pushing it not to
compromise their rights during a new round of fishery talks with
Japan scheduled for July 29 in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Japanese coast guard ships have often chased
Taiwan fishermen away from the two countries' overlapping economic
zones near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea.
Japan has even impounded more than 10 Taiwan fishing boats over the
past year.</P>
      <P>Japanese coast guard ships temporarily suspended patrols in the
disputed waters after some 50 Suao-based fishing boats staged a rare
protest in the waters early this month and a naval warship made a
brief visit to the sensitive zone, supposedly to accentuate Taiwan's
determination to protect its fishermen's rights and safety.
Some 15 lawmakers from across the party spectrum, led by Legislative
Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng, took the cruise aboard the warship in the
company of Defense Minister Lee Jye.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Japanese patrol ships returned to the area again
last weekend and served notice to a Suao-based fishing boat warning
it to leave the region even though the boat was operating within the
middle line of the two countries' overlapping economic zones, known
locally as the "tentative demarcation line."</P>
      <P>A Suao Fishermen's Association spokesman said local fishermen
plan to demonstrate at the JIA office in Taipei next Thursday in
protest over the latest action. The planned protest is also aimed at
reminding the government not to sacrifice fishermen's rights in the
upcoming 15th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks.</P>
      <P>At the heart of the dispute is the two countries' sovereignty
claim to the Tiaoyutai Islands. Both Tokyo and Taipei claim that the
island group falls within their 200-mile exclusive economic zones.
Japan often fines ship owners and impounds Taiwanese fishing vessels
that enter waters close to the Tiaoyutais.</P>
      <P>The previous 14 rounds of Taiwan-Japanese fishery talks did not
make significant headway because Taiwan would not forsake its
sovereignty claim to the Tiaoyutais, which Japan has held since 1971.</P>

      <P>The likelihood of a military conflict

Kuomintang (KMT) official claimed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of KMT Culture and Communication

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILL NOT HINDER CHINA'S PEACEFUL RISE: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not be an obstacle to China's
emergence, providing its emergence is peaceful and not with an eye
toward Taiwan's extermination, Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Voice of America (VOA) , Hsieh said the
basic principle for his administration to develop ties with China is
that it should not compromise the country's status quo and
should serve the interest of the people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will not be interested in improving ties with China if
China poses a threat to its existence, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He ruled out the possibility of his visiting China in the
foreseeable future because of concern that it might give rise to
public mistrust in his government.</P>
      <P>As to China's "one China policy, " the premier said Beijing
defines it in lenient terms while dealing with Taiwan but requests
other countries to follow a strict "one China policy" that recognizes
Beijing as the sole legitimate regime of China.</P>
      <P>Noting that he offered June 13 to negotiate with China on the
exporting of Taiwan fruit to China, visits to Taiwan by Chinese
tourists and the opening of direct chartered flights across the
Taiwan Strait, the premier said Beijing has responded positively to
the first two issues.</P>
      <P>He passed over the question of whether he will run in the 2008
presidential election on the Democratic Progressive Party ticket,
saying that it is too early to say.</P>
      <P>The interview was broadcast Thursday by VOA and its pretext will
be posted on the VOA Web site.</P>
