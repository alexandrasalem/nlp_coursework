    <HEADLINE>New coral reefs discovered in Shanyuan Bay off Taitung County</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   March  31  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Much to the excitement of marine ecologists, new coral reefs have been
discovered in Shanyuan Bay off the southeastern county of Taitung, a local
biodiversity researcher reported Monday.</P>
      <P>"The Shanyuan Bay coral reefs span a broad area of water and contain a wide
diversity of coral strains, " said Chen Chao-lun, an associate researcher at the
Research Center for Biodiversity under Academia Sinica, Taiwan's most
prestigious academic institution.</P>
      <P>"Coral communities can be found in waters one kilometer off the coastline at a
depth of eight to 10 meters, " Chen said, adding that the coral reef located
closest to the coast is only 50 meters away from the shore.</P>
      <P>Chen surveyed waters in Shanyuan Bay earlier this month as part of a study of
coral reef habitats in eastern Taiwan's coastal regions.</P>
      <P>He recorded 110 coral strains, roughly one-third the total number of species
documented in Taiwan waters. Among them, 94 were stone corals, 11 were soft
corals and five were polyp corals.</P>
      <P>"The number indicates that Shanyuan Bay's coral diversity is similar to that
around Green Island," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Shanyuan Bay, located just off the coast from Taitung City, also boasts a dense
and diverse cornularia coral community in which a wealth of fish, shrimp and
shell species live, a phenomenon not seen in the Kenting and Green Island areas,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>A mature, well-developed polyp coral community also exists in three-to-five-
meter-deep waters in the bay, another rarity for Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Most encouraging was that a stem of Oulophyllia bennetthae coral was discovered
in the bay, Chen said, adding that it marked the first time that the coral
strain normally seen in the Indian Ocean was recorded in Taiwan waters.</P>
      <P>"Although this coral species is spread over a wide area, the frequency of its
appearance is very low," Chen explained, adding that the existence of the one-
meter-high,  60-centimeter-wide  coral underscores the diversity of Taiwan's
coral communities.</P>
      <P>Chen's study coincides with a United Nations global coral reefs survey, as 2008
has been designated the International Year of Reefs to enhance public awareness
of the importance of protecting coral reefs and their ecosystems.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was impressed by the special coral reef ecological scenes beneath
Shanyuan Bay, with various kinds of soft corals growing on large reefs.</P>
      <P>"Its beauty and biodiversity rival those found in the Kenting area more than 10
years ago and can even compare with those found off Green Island and Orchid
Island," Chen said.</P>
      <P>With a five-storey holday resort sitting on the bay's left bank, Chen said he is
worried that the coral reefs in the region could face a fate similar to those in
the Kenting area.</P>
      <P>Noting that coral-reef ecosystems  are critical to fishery resources,  leisure
fishing and tourism,  Chen urged relevant government agencies to take immediate
steps to better manage and protect the Shanyuan Bay coral reefs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Mobile operator to recycle old cell phones</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)

(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's second largest telecom operator kicked off a countrywide campaign
Monday to recycle used cell phones to prevent harmful substances from
contaminating landfills and recover valuable metals.</P>
      <P>To promote the recycling of phones and accessories, Taiwan Mobile Co. has
earmarked more than NT$10 million (US$328,947) to equip its 506 stores around
Taiwan with recycling boxes, Harvey Chang, the company's president, announced at
a press conference.</P>
      <P>Those who turn in their cell phones will receive a small solar flashlight, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released by the Environmental  Protection Administration
(EPA), Chang said that fewer than 20 percent of local users' out-of-use cell
phones are recycled even though 60 percent to 80 percent of all cell phone parts
are recyclable.</P>
      <P>Chang said that through recycling, one kilogram of gold and silver  could  be
recovered  from 66,000  and 97,000  phones, respectively, according to figures
released by the Japan-based Telecommunications Carriers Association (TCA).</P>
      <P>Recycling is also critical because of the harmful substances contained in
handsets, including lead, mercury and cadmium, that could contaminate garbage
dumps.</P>
      <P>While Taiwanese acquire mobile phones at a fast pace, buying 7 million handsets
last year according to an International Data Corporation (IDC) survey, too many
users leave their old phones at home, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Aside from the recovery of valuable materials, recycling the phones could help
save energy. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the
electricity conserved by recycling 10,000 mobile phones would be enough to power
the lives of 19 families in the United States for one year.</P>
      <P>The conserved energy is also tantamount to a reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions produced by 14 passenger cars for a year, Chang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH reports 1st fatality from acute viral hepatitis A this year</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)
04/01/08  11:48:32
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (D0H) reported Monday the country's first death from
acute viral hepatitis A this year.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said the
victim was a 30-year-old man who sought treatment March 11 at a medical center
in southern Taiwan. He was in a state of delirium and died March 14 because of
liver and kidney failure.</P>
      <P>Lin said the man's death was closely related to a hepatitis A infection.</P>
      <P>"Hepatitis A was prevalent in Taiwan in earlier days, " Lin said, noting that a
lot of Taiwanese over 50 years old have been infected.</P>
      <P>But with improvements in environmental hygiene and eating habits, the number of
people contracting the infection through contaminated food or drinking water has
declined dramatically.</P>
      <P>"This year, though, the number of the hepatitis cases is worrisome," Lin said.</P>
      <P>He noted that there are already 82 confirmed cases of hepatitis A so far this
year, compared with the 42, 57, 62, 49, 45 cases during the same periods in the
past five years.</P>
      <P>"The upward trend is obvious," he said.</P>
      <P>Among the 82 cases, 47 cases are young men under 30 years old, and among them,
17 were students from 8 to 28 years old, an indication "that the risks of
younger men being infected with hepatitis A are increasing," he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not reported a hepatitis A outbreak for a long time, and the
antibodies in the immune systems of the younger generation have diminished, he
said.</P>
      <P>More frequent meals outside the home and closer contact with people from
Southeast Asia and China have contributed to rising risks, he said.</P>
      <P>Health officials urged the public to avoid eating raw food or drink dirty water
to avoid being infected with the disease, whose symptoms include fever, fatigue,
loss of appetite, vomiting and an upset stomach.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis A vaccines are available, but Taiwan currently only gives free shots
to children between 2 and 12 years old in 30 aboriginal villages in mountainous
areas, nine plains villages adjacent to the mountainous areas, and on the
Taiwan-controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Others have to be inoculated at their own expenses. One shot for an adult will
cost between NT$1,500 (US$49.2) and NT$2,000, while one shot for a child is
around NT$1,000. Two shots are needed to ensure protection against the disease.</P>

      <P>Two senior military  officers who participated in activities supporting specific
candidates prior to two recent elections were disciplined for violating
administrative neutrality, the Ministry of National Defense said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The decision, involving Gen. Chi Lin-lien and Gen. Fei Horng-po, who serve as
strategic advisers to President Chen Shui-bian, was made during a personnel
evaluation meeting, the ministry said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Chi was cited for his attendance at a fundraising dinner held by ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative candidate Lee Wen-chung last
December ahead of the Jan. 12 legislative election.</P>
      <P>Fei was found to have behaved improperly by attending a Feb. 26 symposium at
which opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou  unveiled his
defense policy ahead of the March 22 presidential poll.</P>
      <P>The ministry said Chi was given two demerits, because while he claimed he had
not known the event was a fundraising dinner until he got there, he nevertheless
spoke at the event.</P>
      <P>Fei was given one demerit, as he did not speak at the symposium, the ministry
said.</P>
      <P>The two cases came under public scrutiny after the enlisted son of DPP
presidential  candidate Frank Hsieh was criticized for violating the military's
neutrality by attending one of his father's campaign rallies.</P>
      <P>But the ministry said Tuesday that conscript Hsieh Wei-chou was not punished,
considering that his participation was purely a family affair and that he made
no speech at that rally.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP needs overall review after 3 major setbacks: defeated candidate</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
04/01/08  14:34:23
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) needs to undergo a comprehensive
internal review now that it has suffered three major election setbacks over the
past three years, defeated DPP presidential candidate and party chairman Frank
Hsieh said Monday night.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in an interview with cable television network SET TV, his
first public interview since losing to Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang (KMT) in
the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Hsieh refrained from allocating blame for the defeat, even
when asked if his loss was the result of a lackluster performance by President
Chen Shui-bian and corruption scandals plaguing the president's family members
and close aides during his second term in office.</P>
      <P>"As a vanquished candidate, I myself should be the one to be reviewed, and I'm
not in a position to openly review others, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>With the DPP also having lost the mayoral and magistrate elections in December
2005 and the legislative elections on Jan. 12, 2008, Hsieh said the party
desperately "needs an overall review rather than to target any specific
individuals."</P>
      <P>He said that having served as premier and party chairman, "I have to take my
share of the responsibility."</P>
      <P>Asked about Vice President Annette Lu's claims that his loss resulted from his
attempt to draw a clear line between himself and the president, Hsieh said "that
is open to public opinion."</P>
      <P>But Hsieh noted that he was at a marked disadvantage in his campaign compared to
when President Chen ran for election in 2000 and re-election in 2004.</P>
      <P>The DPP's approval ratings are lower today than they were previously, Hsieh
said, and Chen had NT$2 billion at his disposal to spend on his campaigns
compared to Hsieh's NT$500 million to NT$600 million.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who announced last Friday that he would stay on as party chairman to
bring the demoralized party back to its feet, also dismissed reports that he
would compete in the May 25 race for party chairman.</P>
      <P>"I will not run for party chairman, nor will I endorse or work behind the scenes
for anyone for the post, " he added, insisting that he would only serve as
caretaker party chief until May 25.</P>
      <P>The defeated DPP presidential candidate said he favors an open and transparent
process in selecting a new party head. Those interested in the post should make
their names known so they can be scrutinized, Hsieh said, rather than having an
election decided by backroom dealings or "underhanded maneuvering" as had
occurred in the past.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also indicated that he would not encourage Lee Ying-yuan, the DPP's
secretary-general and one of Hsieh's key campaign managers, to run for the post,
as Lee, 55, is still young and could run for public office.</P>
      <P>Those who choose to run for public office should not serve as party chairman
because it would be difficult to maintain strict impartiality, especially as
primaries create divisions within a party, Hsieh asserted.</P>
      <P>He said the party chairman needs to concentrate on the post and serve out his
two-year term.</P>
      <P>On his suggestion  to reopen  an investigation  into  the presidential election-
eve shooting incident in 2004 during which President Chen and Vice President Lu
were slightly injured, he said the shooting was real but society had become
polarized over the issue due to different political affiliations.</P>
      <P>"If the case is proved real and not staged as the KMT has claimed, then the
wrongs to President Chen should be addressed, but if the case is bogus, then
society needs to learn the truth." Hsieh said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) refuted reports Tuesday that relations
between Taiwan and South Pacific ally Nauru are on alert after the suspension of
a state visit to Taiwan by Nauru's president.</P>
      <P>The ministry insisted that bilateral ties remain close and unchanged.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan maintains  close contact with both the ruling and opposition parties in
Nauru. Therefore diplomatic ties between the two countries will not be affected
by the political deadlock within Nauru, " MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said at a
regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>Nauru currently faces a political standoff after a no-confidence motion against
the government failed in mid-March.</P>
      <P>Although the motion was blocked, the opposition's David Adeang took over as
speaker of Nauru's 18-member Parliament, and he has called on the president to
resign, dissolve the house or seek re-election to end the impasse.</P>
      <P>Nauruan President Marcus Stephen was forced to suspend a state visit to Taiwan

stalemate.</P>
      <P>Describing a report in Taiwan's Liberty Times that bilateral relations between
the two countries are on high alert because of the political uncertainty as
"mere speculation, " Yeh said cooperation projects in agriculture and port
development remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>"The suspension of President Stephen's state visit is simply because of Nauru's
internal affairs, " she said, denying that it had anything to do with China's
intervention.</P>
      <P>China has been trying to suppress Taiwan's international space by using
financial aid to lure Taiwan's diplomatic allies, especially in the Pacific
region, to switch their allegiance to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Many expect cross-Taiwan Strait relations between Taiwan and China to improve
following  President-elect  Ma Ying-  jeou's inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>But the Foreign Ministry warned there would be no diplomatic honeymoon for the
new government as there were signs that China was not easing its campaign to
diplomatically suppress Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Nauru had been allies for 22 years before former Nauruan President
Rene Harris shifted diplomatic allegiance in 2002 from Taiwan to China. On May
2005, then President Lugwig Scotty signed a joint comunique in Taipei on the re-
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Stephen was sworn in as president of Nauru on Dec. 19, 2007 after Scotty was
ousted in a vote of no confidence. Harris has been mentioned as the country's
likely leader if the opposition returns to power.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Peer ostracization main concern of children calling foundation hotline</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 1 (CNA)
04/01/08  16:14:24
(By Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Being ostracized by one's peers is the main concern among children phoning the
Child Welfare League Foundation's hot line for children, according to a report
released by the foundation Monday.</P>
      <P>The report revealed that 32 percent of the 2,703 kids who called the
foundation's hotline last year said their biggest worry was being shunned by
their peers.</P>
      <P>It marked the sixth straight year since the 0800-003-123 hotline was set up in
2002 that this concern has topped the list.</P>
      <P>The foundation, which is devoted to improving the nation's child welfare
services, set up the hotline for children to speak with social workers and
volunteers and share their thoughts and emotions in order to help them ease the
pressures and burdens they face.</P>
      <P>Of the 2,703 calls to the hotline last year, over 70 percent were made by girls,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>The report's finding that nearly one-third of the children who used the hotline
expressed concerns about being ostracized by peers tallies with the results of
the foundation's campus survey in 2005.</P>
      <P>In that survey, 65 percent of the child respondents said they had experienced
being excluded from the group or being subjected to ridicule at some point in
their lives, with 90 percent of those kids feeling sad, angry or embarrassed as
a result, and a small number even contemplating suicide.</P>
      <P>Second on the list of troubles expressed by kids using the hotline last year was
pressure resulting from a heavy homework workload, representing 18 percent of
the calls.</P>
      <P>The third most common reason children used the hotline last year was excessive
interference by parents or guardians in their lives, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The report also found that more and more boys are phoning the hotline to ask
questions related to sex and sexuality, with a total of 82 such calls to the
hotline last year, or ten times the number five years earlier.</P>
      <P>The hotline received a significant number of calls from girls who lack
confidence because of dissatisfaction  with their physical appearance for
various reasons, ranging from feeling overweight to considering themselves ugly
in comparison with their pop idols.</P>
      <P>A total of 115 girls called the hotline with such concerns last year, more than
3.5 times the number of calls by boys for similar reasons.</P>
      <P>Another  trouble  expressed  mainly by girls was excessive comparison of
themselves to other people by members of their family, with 41 girls calling the
hotline last year for this reason, or almost seven times the number of boys who
did so.</P>
      <P>The fourth major trouble expressed by kids who phoned the foundation's hotline
last year was a lack of any outlets through which they could talk about their
feelings, with 6.1 percent of the calls falling in this category.</P>
      <P>Many of these callers said they do not understand why adults only express their
expectations and use their authority without ever listening to what the children
have to say.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, the foundation's Children's Hotline had received a
total of nearly 66,200 calls since being set up in 2002, an average of about 47
calls in the three hours the hotline is open between Monday and Friday from 4:30
p.m. to 7:30 p.m.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President, president-elect debate '1992 consensus'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    April   1   (CNA)
04/01/08  16:47:43
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President  Chen  Shui-bian  and President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) exchanged divergent views Tuesday of the so-called "1992
consensus, " which has been proposed as the basis for Taiwan and China to resume
stalled dialogue.</P>
      <P>In the first meeting between the two since the March 22 presidential election,
the Presidential Office had planned to have Chen and Ma pose for photographers
for five minutes before meeting behind closed doors.</P>
      <P>But the five minutes stretched to nearly an hour as the two elaborated on their
views of the "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>Ma's spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said later that the meeting was held in a positive
atmosphere, although Ma had suggested an open meeting throughout.</P>
      <P>The Office of the President had advocated a private meeting so that Chen could
brief Ma on classified information related to Taiwan's defense, security and
foreign diplomatic situations.</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus" -- a term coined by former Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Su Chi in 2000 -- refers to a "one China, different interpretation"
understanding that the KMT claims was reached during talks held in 1992 in Hong
Kong between representatives of Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, both sides agreed to disagree on the definition of "one
China," according to the KMT.</P>
      <P>President Chen said he noticed that Ma has suggested that the two sides resume
talks based on the understanding, but he reiterated that he himself "couldn't
accept the term."</P>
      <P>Chen suggested  "three uncertainties"  regarding  the "1992 consensus, "
questioning whether it actually exists, its substantive content, and its
possible development and changes.</P>
      <P>"One has to be highly vigilant if the resumption of cross-strait talks are built
on uncertainties," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that both former President Lee Teng-hui and Koo Chen-fu, the late
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation and Taiwan's top negotiator with
China in the 1990s, said the consensus didn't exist.</P>
      <P>"Using a non-existent term as the basis for cross-strait talks is questionable,"
Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>He also said that China is opposed to "one China and one Taiwan" across the
Taiwan Strait or "two Chinas," and Taiwan should not engage in "wishful
thinking."</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that China wants one China, while Taiwan wants two different
interpretations and questioned what would happen if Taiwan failed to get what it
wanted but fell into the "one-China" trap.</P>
      <P>"Will  this  not violate  your  fundamental  principle  of Taiwan-centric policy
and the best interests of the people? the president asked Ma.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the "one China, two different interpretations" formula was one
that satisfied neither side but that both could reluctantly accept.</P>
      <P>Ma said that after assuming office on May 20, he will immediately open
discussions with China on trade issues, direct transportation links, tourism,
and even a peace agreement, which will provide a good gauge of both sides
understanding and acceptance of the formula.</P>
      <P>If China says no, that there is only one China and no different interpretations,
then "we'll quit the talks, because we couldn't continue the talks," Ma added.</P>
      <P>But if the consensus exists, Ma said, "we should talk."</P>
      <P>The president-elect assured Chen that he would be a worthy successor.</P>
      <P>"You've passed the baton to me, and I will not drop it. I couldn't possibly sell
out Taiwan. My love for Taiwan is not less than yours," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that he will safeguard the "nation's sovereignty and take care of
people's best interests."</P>
      <P>"We all love Taiwan, but we've different ways to deal with China," Ma said,
adding that "now it's our turn, and we'll have the opportunity to try our way."</P>
      <P>If Taiwan, China and the United States can all accept the consensus, then the
risks of cross-strait conflict should diminish, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The one-hour open meeting began with Chen and Ma speaking positively of each
other, and Chen expressed the hope that after he steps down on May 20, it will
mark the end of confrontation between his supporters and opponents and ring in
the Ma era.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he passed the Taipei mayoral baton to Ma in 1998, just as he will
pass the presidential baton to Ma on May 20 this year.</P>
      <P>"Maybe it's God's will, or some may say it is coincidence, or some could even
say that it is a happy occasion on the political scene," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president said that between now and May 20, his top priority will be the
transfer of power. He hoped that "this is the first meting, but will by no means
the last" if any needs arise.</P>
      <P>Ma said he cherished the election results, vowing to "obey the majority, respect
the minority, and engage in dialogue with those with different views, " now that
the KMT has a firm grip in both the executive and legislative branches of the
government.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's people had chosen him by a clear majority, they had not
completely repudiated the DPP, Ma said, adding that he hopes the DPP, which has
been thrown into disarray due to two major election setbacks this year, will
regroup for a fresh start.</P>
      <P>He said he is "willing to engage in fair competition rather than perpetual
bickering with the DPP."</P>
      <P>Also attending Tuesday's meeting were Chan Chuen-po, director of Ma's office,
and Chan Chi-shean, a Ma adviser and former superintendent of Chi Mei Hospital
in Tainan County, where President Chen was treated for a gunshot wound on the
eve of the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>President Chen was accompanied by Presidential Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen
and Lin Teh-shun, director of President Chen's office.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of university students who said they are concerned about the
controversial Suao-Hualien expressway construction, requested during a protest
Tuesday that the caretaker Cabinet refrain from making the final decision on the
project, and suggested that the incoming government consider alternative
transportation solutions.</P>
      <P>One of the group's organizers questioned the motives of he Environmental
Protection Agency, which is expected to approve the project, in convening a
meeting on the issue less than two weeks after the March 22 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>"An important case like the construction of the Suao-Hualien Expressway should
not be decided by the caretaker Cabinet," said Tsai Zhong-yue, one of the
leaders of the demonstration.</P>
      <P>He urged that the new government, which will take office in May, to consider
other transportation solutions "such as a high-speed ferry," instead of the
expressway.</P>
      <P>In 2007 Japan introduced a high-speed ferry service to provide public
transportation between Hokkaido and Honshu, the Japanese mainland. This type of
ferry can be adapted to Taiwan's marine conditions, organizers of the
demonstration said, adding that it can operate during the monsoon season without
any problem.</P>
      <P>According to the students, most of whom are from Hualien, the ferries, which
cost NT$3 billion each, can travel at speeds of 65 to 70 km/h, and can make the
run between Suao and Hualien in 80 minutes. Six ferries would be adequate to
accommodate the volume of passengers in eastern Taiwan, they suggested.</P>
      <P>"The construction of the expressway will take about 10 years -- it is not a
solution for people in eastern Taiwan who need transportation immediately," said
Pan Han-shen, secretary general of the Green Party Taiwan, who, along with other
environmentalists, came out in support of the students' demonstration.</P>
      <P>Pan agreed that a high-speed ferry would be a cheaper and better solution to the
transportation problem in the area, compared to the expressway, which may cost
more than NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>The 86-kilometer expressway, designed to boost the economy of eastern Taiwan,
was conditionally approved by an EPA Environmental Impact Assessment
subcommittee in early March.</P>
      <P>But the demonstrators argued that the idea of an expressway was not the only
means of improving the economy and facilitating traffic in eastern Taiwan.
Making improvements to Taiwan Highway 9 and the North-Link railway line are also
possible alternative solutions, they suggested.</P>
      <P>The also expressed concern over the safety of the expressway project and its
impact on the bio-ecological system, saying that the plans include about 40 km
of tunnels that pass through 11 fault areas in the region where earthquakes
occur frequently.</P>
      <P>The association, comprised of several groups of university students, focuses
mainly on matters related to climate change, but refused to be tagged as
"environmentalist," in the hope of extending its advocacy to social issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. couple adopts baby when it was suspected of being HIV positive</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. couple on Tuesday adopted a local 16-month-old baby boy, having gone
through with adoption procedures even when he was suspected of being infected
with the AIDS-causing virus, HIV, but the baby later tested negative.</P>
      <P>The child,named Marshall, was abandoned at a shelter shortly after his drug
addicted mother gave birth to him. He was suspected of being HIV-positive
because his mother was positive.</P>
      <P>Despite knowing this, a couple from Texas decided to go ahead with procedures to
adopt him. During the adoption process, the boy was confirmed to be HIV
negative.</P>
      <P>"Marshall is special to us because he is now our son, " the child's adopted
father Joshua Bush said at an adoption ceremony, adding that it did not matter
to him or his wife whether Marshall was HIV positive or negative. "We are
grateful that God has chosen us as parents of Marshall."</P>
      <P>Left at a shelter, Marshall was later placed in another shelter run by the
Garden of Mercy Foundation (GMF) , a local charity dedicated  to limiting  the
spread  of HIV  and  eliminating discrimination against those-infected with the
virus in society.</P>
      <P>The Bushes, who already have a 10-year-old daughter and an 8 year-old son, came
in contact with Marshall through their volunteer work with the charity on
weekends, Chang Li-shu, chairwoman of the charity foundation, said.</P>
      <P>Commending the love of the Bushes as "boundary less, " Chang said that even
though Marshall was at one time suspected to be HIV positive, the couple never
reduced their love for him and decided to have him as a member of their family.</P>
      <P>After six months of efforts,  including going through the Taiwanese and U.S.
application process, the Bushes finally were allowed to adopt Marshall, Chang
added.</P>
      <P>Marshall's birth mother is currently in prison.</P>
      <P>Another four foreign couples are currently applying to adopt babies from Taiwan
suspected of having HIV. The infants are currently being cared for at the
charity.</P>
      <P>Some 50 newborn babies in Taiwan are suspected of being infected with HIV or
having full-blown AIDS through their mother every year, said Lu Chun-yi, a
pediatrician at National Taiwan University Hospital.</P>
      <P>"If we can provide appropriate medical treatment to the babies, the infection
rate may be reduced from 40 percent to one percent," Lu said.</P>
      <P>In order to show more concern for underprivileged people, Liu Chun-hsiang,
director of the Division of Welfare Services for Children and Youth, in Taipei
City's Department of Social Affairs said "the public should be educated."</P>
      <P>"Most people in our society misunderstand HIV/AIDS, and I hope everyone can join
the work to take care of AIDS babies," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Chang urged people "to be brave enough to show concern about the HIV/AIDS
infected babies because they need our love."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA subsidizes health care sector to boost industry innovation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ten companies won an overall subsidy of NT$18. 3 million (US$0.61 million) from
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to boost technological innovations so as
to upgrade health care facilities and services, the ministry's Department of
Industrial Technology (DOIT) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The subsidy is part of MOEA's "Innovative Technology Applications &amp;Services
Program (ITAS)", a 2008 program which combines the Program for Innovative
Technology Applications (ITAP) and Innovative Service R&amp;D Program (ISP).</P>
      <P>Integrating the two programs' resources, the ITAS could help stimulate new
business opportunities  for the industry through diversified development of
novel operation models, said Wu Ming-chi, Deputy Director of the department.</P>
      <P>"The MOEA aims to advance industry sectors by adopting the latest technologies
to upgrade their business operations," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Medicare company Medtecs International and Wanfang Hospital are among the 10
companies that received the subsidies for their projects. Their projects will
cost NT$48.6 million, meaning 62 percent of the budget still requires private
funding.</P>
      <P>The project of Medtecs International will combine Information Technology (IT)
with health care services to provide patients with at home medicares, using
digital interactive TV to monitor patient's status and provide more timely
medication.</P>
      <P>Wanfang Hospital's project aims at helping sick elderly recover from old age
illnesses through the playing of computer games. The hospital believes helping
seniors maintain a playful attitude and good mood will help them rehabilitate.</P>
      <P>So far the two programs, ITAP and ISP, launched in the late 1980s, have
subsidized roughly 40 projects each year, said Frank Yang, director of
Innovative Technology Applications &amp; Services Project Office.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the two programs had attracted 142 project applicants, with 66 of them
winning government financial support, a total amount of NT$480 million, Yang
added. The maximum amount of subsidy for each company is NT$30 million within
three years, he said.</P>
      <P>Since its launch in 1988, the ITAP has successfully helped more than 300
companies from a variety of industry sectors, including IT industrial e-Business
and Innovation Service to develop new operating models and establish
benchmarking for other companies to follow.</P>
      <P>Those companies have invested over NT$10 billion in self-raised funding and
employed  over 5,000 staffs in both advanced  IT applications and management
innovation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BTCO launches art exhibition at new office</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) held a reception Monday to welcome
British artist Susan Stockwell and her work, which is being exhibited at the new
offices of the BTCO.</P>
      <P>"I am delighted that the BTCO has been able to host this exhibition -- the first
to make use of the public area in the new offices we moved into in January this
year, " said BTCO Director Michael Reilly. "Susan's meticulous and detailed work
provides a contrast  to the spacious,  minimalist  design of the offices
themselves."</P>
      <P>He added that Stockwell's residency in Taipei last year came under the auspices
of the Taiwan-U.K. Artists' Fellowships Program and is an excellent example of
U.K.-Taiwan cooperation in the arts.</P>
      <P>Stockwell transformed materials such as calligraphy paper, paper cut-outs,
needlework, paper, and scrolls into her residency project, "Mapping the City, "
and developed a new interpretation of "Line Drawing" during her three-month stay
at Taipei Artist Village in the winter of 2007.</P>
      <P>During her second visit to Taipei, the celebrated British artist brought her art
back to demonstrate again her perception of Taipei City and her experience of
the culture in Taiwan, which were transformed  into esthetic works to create a
dialogue between different people and cultures.</P>
      <P>"The work is sort of abstract. You wouldn't notice those things when you look at
it, " Stockwell said. "I tried to make it beautiful and use these interesting
materials, which people are familiar with but often take for granted, and change
the way people look at them."</P>
      <P>Stockwell has established  a reputation for using everyday materials, much of it
already worn out or discarded, not just to create imaginative works but to
deliver powerful messages, often about identity.</P>
      <P>Through her research into Taiwan's history and her tours of Taipei city,
Stockwell became impressed with Taipei's temples, shrines and monks, all mixed
in and part of a concrete jungle.</P>
      <P>"Obviously Taipei grew very rapidly and had a big (economic) boom. However, it
has retained a kind of friendliness, and people seem to be quite laid back as if
they are living in another time, " she said. "It's a sort of nice mix here --
it's very new and modern but it's also got old bits."</P>
      <P>She added that Taipei is more relaxed and friendly compared to Hong Kong or
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Her work, "Taipei Arteries," a cut-out of a red bus road map that illustrates
the road arteries of the city and also symbolizes human veins, is particularly
interesting to viewers.</P>
      <P>"It is very special how the artist transformed the network of urbanites'
everyday life into some kind of artistic totem, " said Jenny Hsu, a student at
the Institute of Fashion and Communications Design at Shih Chien University.</P>
      <P>Stockwell said that she likes the idea of crossing over, from human anatomy to
streets, fusing maps of the body and maps of the city.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which is open to the general public free of charge from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. on weekdays, starts April 1 and ends on May 31.</P>

      <P>The Nantou County Police Bureau announced Tuesday that police arrested a man a
day earlier for making telephone threats last month to kill Buddhist Master Wei
Chueh, founding abbot of the Chung Tai Chan Monastery in the county's Puli
township.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-min, head of the police bureau, said his officers traced the suspect, 45
-year-old Wu Chien-hua, to the central city of Taichung and arrested him under
the direction of Taichung Public Prosecutor Huang Yung-fu.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the police officers searched Wu's residence and found a
Chunghua Telecom IC phone card with which the threatening call was made from a
public phone booth March 23. Wu admitted making the call.</P>
      <P>Wu, a construction worker, told police he made the threats against Master Wei
Chueh and his followers after learning from media reports that the Buddhist
master had urged the monks and nuns of the monastery and other followers to
boycott the two referendums held alongside the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The two referendums, related to Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations, were
defeated because only 26 percent of the electorate took part in the voting,
failing to pass the threshold of at least 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Expressing remorse, Wu said he made the threatening phone call "on the spur of
the moment" and that although he is a political enthusiast, he had no intention
of harming anyone.</P>
      <P>Wu will be referred to the Public Prosecutors' Office in Nantou County and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2008 Taiwan International Orchid Show held last month in southern Taiwan's
Tainan county has received more than NT$2.4 billion (US$78.69 million) in export
orders, a 65 percent increase from last year's show, the county's magistrate Su
Huan-chih announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Su said the show attracted more than 200,000 visitors from Taiwan and abroad as
well as 2,000-plus buyers from 24 countries. during its 10-day run which ended
on March 17.</P>
      <P>Some of the orders for several species or patent species were in the quantity of
millions, Su said.</P>
      <P>This year, the American Orchid Society (AOS), which was asked to send officials
to the show to serve as judges, broke a record in the number of orchid plants to
which it gave the highest honor, said Lee Chang-yu, president of the Taiwan
Orchid Growers' Association.</P>
      <P>Lee said that six orchid plants received the highest honor of first class
certificate from the American society, breaking the society's record. The
American group usually metes out around a dozen such certificates a year.</P>
      <P>This also marked the first year that the American judges gave out more than four
of the top certificates to a single show since its establishment in the 1920s.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that due to competition from such European flower producing giants as
the Netherlands, Taiwan orchid growers have continued to cultivate new orchid
species and upgrade its productivity to "maintain a certain competitive edge in
the international community."</P>
      <P>He said he was optimistic export orders for next year's orchid show will be even
higher.</P>
      <P>This was the fourth year the annual show had been held at the International
Flora Exhibition Center of the Taiwan Orchid Plantation. The exhibition was
organized by the Taiwan orchid association and jointly sponsored by the Tainan
County government and semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council.</P>
      <P>Orchids are one of Taiwan's major exports, accounting for over 50 percent of the
total value of Taiwan's horticultural exports, with the Taiwan Orchid Plantation
playing an important role in Taiwan's increasing orchid exports each year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported NT$1.84 billion worth of orchids in 2006, a year-on-year
increase of 24.1 percent, with butterfly orchids, or phalaenopsis, accounting
for NT$1.15 billion of the total, according to customs statistics.</P>
      <P>Known as the "Kingdom of the Butterfly Orchid", Taiwan is the world's largest
exporting country of the flower. About half the world's butterfly orchid
varieties are bred in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's orchid export orders secured at the Taiwan International Orchid Show
totaled NT$800 million in 2005, NT$1 billion in 2006 and NT$1.5 billion in 2007,

    <HEADLINE>CPC Corp. to continue fuel price freeze in April</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned CPC Corp., Taiwan, the country's biggest oil refiner, announced
Tuesday that the company will continue its freeze on gasoline and diesel prices
in line with government policy.</P>
      <P>CPC officials said that if calculated according to the floating oil price
system, the price of unleaded gasoline should be increased by NT$4 per liter,
while the price of diesel should be increased by NT$4.4 per liter.</P>
      <P>They noted that world crude oil prices have increased by 34.84 percent since
last September, far surpassing the 12 percent cap for a gasoline price freeze,
but added that the company will nevertheless continue the freeze.</P>
      <P>The officials said the company has absorbed all the losses incurred due to
surging world oil prices, losing NT$6.8 billion in January and NT$6.4 billion in
February. It is estimated that the losses will amount to more than NT$9 billion
in March, with the total losses in the first quarter surpassing NT$22.2 billion.</P>
      <P>They added that the company had increased its fuel supply by an average of 26
percent as of Monday, higher than its original estimate, after its rival,
Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (FPCC) -- Taiwan's biggest private refiner --
announced a price hike last week, leading to a run on CPC filling stations.</P>
      <P>The FPCC announced that its gasoline and diesel prices would be increased by
NT$2.8 and NT$3.1 per liter from March 29 in response to surging costs.</P>
      <P>The CPC officials said that with the continued freeze, the CPC will lose even
more if they sell more.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said the CPC's gasoline and diesel fuel
accounts for 78 percent of the domestic market share, but judging from the 26
percent increase in CPC fuel supplies, all FPCC customers have switched to the
CPC stations over the past few days.</P>
      <P>The officials said they still have enough production to meet the increased
market demand and that the company is also maintaining a 60-day stockpile.</P>
      <P>The MOEA ordered a freeze on the floating mechanism last November 2007 out of
concern that continuous hikes would fan inflationary pressure.</P>
      <P>The CPC adopted a floating pricing mechanism in January 2007 under which it
adjusted its fuel prices on a weekly basis in response to crude oil price
fluctuations. The system was then replaced by a monthly adjustment mechanism
last September.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reiterated Tuesday that his Cabinet will comply with
the relevant laws during the caretaker period to ensure a peaceful transition of
power to the new administration.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the conclusion of an interpellation session in the Legislative Yuan,
Chang said compared with 2000 and 2004 when the election outcome drew protests
among some people, the results of the March 22 presidential election were
readily accepted by the public, which, he said, demonstrated the maturity of
Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>Chang gave the assurance that while the Cabinet will make sure the government
continues to function normally, it will also comply with the legal restrictions
regarding personnel appointments and policy declarations in the period prior to
the new president's inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>Reviewing the achievements of the Democratic Progressive Party administration
over the past eight years, Chang noted that local workers, who had no retirement
coverage eight years ago, are now guaranteed pensions under a new retirement
program.</P>
      <P>Chang further noted that elderly farmers, who previously received an allowance
of only NT$3,000 per month, are now given NT$6,000 per month and that the
national pension program, which was still only on paper eight years ago, is set
to be implemented in October this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the improvement in the country's social security network,
Taiwan's technological development has also made major strides, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>He cited the fact that there were no 12-inch wafer foundries in Taiwan eight
years ago, and that today there are 17, with that number expected to increase to
20 next year. Also, the display panel industry had almost no presence in Taiwan
eight years ago, but now large display panels made in Taiwan are seizing the
biggest share of the global market, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Other accomplishments by the DPP administration include the completion of the
high-speed railway system and the Hsuehshan Tunnel as well as the launch of

      <P>The results of a recent survey show that 25 percent of the foreign mothers of
local children have difficulty understanding their children's homework and
parent-teacher contact sheets, and are thus unaware of their children's needs
and behavior at school.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between October and December of last year by Yeh Yu-
ching, an associate professor at National Chiayi University,  among  306
foreign  mothers  of elementary-  and kindergarten-aged children around Tainan
City in southern Taiwan, 207 of whom are from China and 99 of whom are from
Vietnam.</P>
      <P>The survey, commissioned by the city's Family Education Center, found that 48
percent of the foreign mothers are worried about their children's behavior at
school, while 54 percent of them are deeply concerned about their children's
future.</P>
      <P>Fifty percent do not want their families labeled as problem families, the survey
results show.</P>
      <P>Although more than 70 percent of the foreign mothers have their husbands'
support with regard to their children's education, 26 percent of them, mostly
Vietnamese, still have problems understanding their children's homework, due
largely to the language barrier.</P>
      <P>The results also show that more than 50 percent of the foreign mothers suffer
many annoyances in their day-to-day lives, with many of them feeling strong
pressure regarding the education of their children.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese medical leader called on the Japanese government Tuesday to help
Taiwan enter the World Health Organization (WHO) as soon as possible, saying
that the fate of both countries are closely linked in a regional health network.</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-min, chairman of the Foundation of Medical Professionals Alliance in
Taiwan, made the remarks at a seminar held in Tokyo at the invitation of Japan's
Asia Affairs Research Council.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, when severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out between
2002-2003, there were 1,706 SARS cases around the world, 774 of which were
fatal, including 13 people from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The epidemic caused much panic in Taiwan, with almost all economic activities
stopped due to fear that the disease might be spread further," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Using its experience in fighting SARS, the Taiwanese government later drew up a
series of measures to combat avian influenza, Wu added.</P>
      <P>"In addition to preparing the anti-avian flu medicine Tamiflu, 25 million masks
and 5 million sets of quarantine clothes, Taiwan has a National Health Command
Center that is in charge of controlling diseases efficiently," Wu said.</P>
      <P>"If Japan wants to prevent avian flu, it should cooperate with Taiwan, " he went
on.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are more than 300,000 foreign laborers working in Taiwan and
some 2 million visits made by tourists and traders between Taiwan and Japan a
year, Wu said the disease could spread in a very short time should an outbreak
occur.</P>
      <P>He urged the Japanese government to push the WHO to admit Taiwan. According to
Wu, Japan contributes 19.25 percent of the WHO's budget, just behind the 22
percent provided by the United States.</P>
      <P>He also pinpointed China as the biggest problem in epidemic prevention, citing
the example that some 15 percent of birds smuggled from China to Taiwan carry
the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus, while some 14 billion chickens
and pigs in China are raised in unsanitary conditions.</P>
      <P>In addition, he continued, the Chinese government habitually conceals the real
epidemic situation within its borders and its people seldom seek medical help
from hospitals. "All these are unfavorable factors for epidemic prevention
work," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He said there have already been 350 avian flu cases around the globe among
humans, with more than 20 fatalities.</P>
      <P>Experts have speculated that 20 percent of the world population would be
infected by avian flu in the event of an epidemic, with more than 100 million
deaths.</P>

      <P>Several environmental  associations announced Tuesday a series of activities to
mark Earth Day which falls on April 22, urging the public to take concrete
action in their daily lives to reduce carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>Earth Day was initiated in the United States in 1970s, the period during which
the consumption of leaded fuel was at its peak, with the aim of enhancing
people's awareness of environmental protection. It became an international event
in 1990 with the participation of 141 countries worldwide, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More than 500 million people from 184 countries, representing 17,000
organizations will participate in the international event this year, under the
theme of "climate change," the associations said.</P>
      <P>"We call on individuals to make an effort in their daily lives to help reduce
carbon emissions, " said Hong You-lun, director of an association  whose goal is
to promote  the welfare  of local communities.</P>
      <P>He further indicated that people can contribute to environmental protection on a
daily basis by avoiding "all-you-can-eat buffets," which he said usually lead to
over-eating and waste, and by choosing locally produced rather than imported
food, as the shipment of food is also a source of carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>Jiang Hui-yi, a member of an environmental education association, encouraged
people to plant gardens on their rooftops or balconies where they can grow

    <HEADLINE>Exhibition on Western medicine in Taiwan opens</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An exhibition showcasing the history of the development of Western medicine in
Taiwan through a presentation of photos, books and a reconstruction of a
hospital ward was officially opened to the public Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing  the opening ceremony,  Lin Huoy-fen,  executive secretary of the
Taipei City Archives, said that through the exhibition, titled The Story of
Doctors, "the public can get a better understanding of how Western medicine was
introduced to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the show, which recounts a number of stories about early
medical practitioners, is designed to take the audience on a voyage of discovery
through the history of Taiwan's medical development during three eras.</P>
      <P>The three eras -- the Presbyterian missionary period, the Japanese colonial
government period and the post-war period -- were suggested by the late Dr. Du
Tsung-min (1893-1986) , the first Taiwanese person to receive a degree in
Western medicine.</P>
      <P>Chen Yong-hsing,  executive director of the Taiwan Medical Humanitarian
Foundation (TMHF) -- one of the event organizers -- expressed hope that the
exhibition will help acquaint younger generations with the medical achievements
of their forefathers.</P>
      <P>Noting that the TMHF was founded in 1997 with the aim of promoting medical
humanitarianism and cultural development in Taiwan, Chen added that "we have to
learn about the history of Taiwan's development, as well as the spirit of our
ancestors."</P>
      <P>Chiang Chao-gen, executive director of the Chiang Wei-shui Cultural Foundation,
said that not only does the exhibition present apart of the country's history,
it also reflects the importance of humanitarianism in medicine.</P>
      <P>"We have to learn from our ancestors about selflessness, " said Chiang, a
descendent of the late Dr. Chiang Wei-shui (1891-1931) who was seen as a
political revolutionary during the period of Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>The Story of Doctors, organized by the TMHF and the Department of Cultural
Affairs of Taipei City Government, is being staged at the New Cultural Movement
Memorial Hall in Taipei City from April 1-May 18.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA promotes industrial strategies at APEC forum</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) expressed his concern
Tuesday for Taiwan's small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the face of an
increasingly competitive global market, citing capital and innovation as key
factors to their future development.</P>
      <P>The MOEA,  which is hosting a forum of Small and Medium Enterprises Working
Group (SMEWG) under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) , hopes to
promote its main industrial strategies in the panel discussions at the meeting.</P>
      <P>"The number one challenge for SMEs is the heavy capital required to start a
business," said Yun- Lung Yeh, Deputy Director General of the Small &amp; Medium
Enterprises Administration under the MOEA.</P>
      <P>Nothing that investment loans and production costs are the major burdens on
SMEs, Yeh said that while the gross profit margin for average small and medium
enterprises is usually bigger than for large enterprises, small businesses
record only one third or one fourth of the net profit margin of large
enterprises.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that it is not a matter of revenue, but a matter of making real
profit," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Another problem smaller companies face is insufficient capital to the fund
research and development (R&amp;D) that could enhance product innovation,  he
said,  adding  that there  were however  some alternatives.</P>
      <P>"Companies with smaller investments could instead adopt the business models of
acquisition &amp; development (A&amp;D) or connection and development (C&amp;D)
to increase their chances of staying in the market," Yeh advised.</P>
      <P>Smaller companies need to develop high-end, value-added products rather than
settle for being downstream manufacturers, he added.</P>
      <P>The MOEA has several plans in progress for SMEs to develop their operations,
including a proposal for enterprise  start-up and incubation and an SME Credit
Guarantee Fund.</P>
      <P>The SME Credit Guarantee Fund, which has a total budget of NT$5 billion this
year, makes its easier for SMEs' to secure credit guarantees in order to obtain
loans.</P>
      <P>Yeh also suggested that Taiwan's aging society and its low birth rate could mean
new business opportunities, as changing demographics can help boost "emerging
industries" such as the senior service industry.</P>
      <P>The forum, which is being held from March 30 to April 4 in the southern port
city of Kaohsiung, has attracted officials and business representatives from 21
APEC members and observer countries. Juan Carlos Capunay, Executive Director of
the APEC Secretariat and Teng Theng Dar, CEO of Singapore Business Federation
are among the resource persons at the forum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cap on oil prices to remain until May: Premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
04/01/08  21:49:45
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has decided to maintain the cap on the price of oil products
from Taiwan's state-run oil company in April, but whether it would continue
doing so in May will depend on world market conditions at that time, Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the Executive Yuan decided to ban state-owned CPC Corp., Taiwan
from raising its product prices owing to grave concerns over the country's
overall economic interests, despite a proposal by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) to remove the cap.</P>
      <P>Some people speculated that the current government was unwilling to raise the
price of gasoline and other fuel products, saving the unpleasant task for the
incoming presidential administration, but Chang rejected such claims.</P>
      <P>"I keenly hope that the public would not use a political viewpoint to judge the
issue, because it is not just an issue about the profitability of state-run
enterprises, " he explained, adding that state companies are not set up to just
make money.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks to reporters prior to a Legislative Yuan session. The
Apple Daily reported Tuesday that a recent poll has found that 47.55 percent of
the respondents said that they support price hikes by the CPC Corp., after its
private rival, Formosa Petrochemical Corp., increased the price of its gasoline
and diesel goods late last week.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang (KMT) beat the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) candidate Frank Hsieh with a broad margin of more than 2.21
million votes in the March 22 presidential election. The president-elect is
scheduled to be sworn in on May 20.</P>
      <P>Formosa  Petrochemical,  Taiwan's  biggest  private refiner, increased the price
of its gasoline and diesel products by NT$2.8 per liter and NT$3.1 per liter,
respectively, beginning Saturday, in response to rising costs. The price
increases will remain in effect until the end of April, the company said.</P>
      <P>The premier questioned how the entire society would respond if the government
raises fuel and oil prices at this critical time when an appreciating New Taiwan
dollar has slashed the competitiveness of local export businesses, although he
acknowledged that maintaining a freeze on product prices is not an effective
solution.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar has appreciated by about 8 percent against the U.S. dollar
in recent days.</P>
      <P>"The government's top priority at present is to heed the nation's overall
economic development and assist the underprivileged and the small and medium-
sized businesses to tackle rising product prices, " he asserted.</P>
      <P>Turning to the news that the MOEA would call a public hearing to explore public
opinion regarding the CPC Corp.'s price increases, Chang said that the MOEA is
welcome to do so.</P>
      <P>Since the March 22 presidential race, the MOEA has twice proposed that the
Executive Yuan lift the freeze on the state oil provider's product prices.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun said during the legislative
session the same day that the government's decision to keep gasoline and fuel
prices stable was made jointly by the Cabinet, not solely by Chang or Deputy
Premier Chiou I-yen.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chen's remarks, KMT Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang accused the current
caretaker DPP administration of using a political approach to deal with an issue
of grave concern to the people's everyday life.</P>
      <P>"Premier Chang should assume the responsibility to adequately address the issue
now, despite the fact that there is only more than one month to go before the
inauguration of the new government, " Hsieh argued.</P>
      <P>The MOEA ordered a freeze in November 2007 of a floating oil pricing mechanism
adopted by the CPC Corp. in an effort to curb inflationary pressures,
particularly as the presidential race was approaching.</P>
      <P>The state-owned  oil supplier adopted the floating pricing mechanism in January
2007 under which it adjusted its domestic fuel prices on a weekly basis in
response to crude oil price fluctuations. The system was replaced by a monthly
adjustment mechanism last September.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should take the biggest share of the blame for the
ruling Democratic Progressive party's (DPP's) defeat in the March 22
presidential election, a former DPP legislator said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tuan Yi-kang, former chief convener of the disbanded New Tide faction of the
DPP, told a press conference that as the individual wielding the greatest power
in both the DPP and Taiwan for the past eight years, Chen must shoulder the
biggest portion of the blame for the  defeat  of DPP presidential  candidate
Frank  Hsieh  by President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Tuan expressed hope that a review of why the DPP lost the election will not turn
into a "witch hunt."</P>
      <P>"I hope we are not setting up a straw man as a target for all the arrows and
have it burned," Tuan said, adding that other DPP members should also be held
responsible for the election loss, although it would be difficult to apportion
the blame in exact percentages.</P>
      <P>He said one of the reasons for the DPP's defeat is that the party's clean image
was tarnished because DPP members condoned the dubious integrity of a few
individuals and allowed the problem to become one of "collective moral
depravation."</P>
      <P>Tuan said he will not run for DPP chairman, a post Hsieh said he will not
relinquish until after May 20. He said the next DPP chairman does not have to be
chosen through direct election and that he is opposed to selecting the next DPP
chairman according to approval ratings measured by polls.</P>
      <P>"The new DPP chairman, who must have substantial support within the party, can
be elected by the DPP Central Executive Committee or the Central Standing
Committee," he noted.</P>

      <P>Contra Costa County, California, is hoping to strengthen sister county ties and
enhance bilateral cooperation with Taichung County in central Taiwan, according
to a visiting U.S. official Monday.</P>
      <P>Susan Bonilla, Contra Costa County's supervisor of District Four, expressed the
hope to Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng Monday during her visit to
Taichung.</P>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of Contra Costa County, Bonilla said the county, located in
the San francisco Bay Area of California, wants to enhance its cooperation with
Taichung County in a variety of aspects, such as economy, education, art, and
culture, based on a resolution made by the five-member Contra Costa Board of
Supervisors.</P>
      <P>Contra Costa County is governed by five supervisors. Each of whom is elected on
a non-partisan basis from a separate district where he or she lives.</P>
      <P>Bonilla received a warm welcome from Huang, who told Bonilla that Taichung
County is also willing to strengthen bilateral relations through more frequent
exchanges and interactions.</P>
      <P>Huang told Bonilla that Taichung County enjoys abundant natural and cultural
resources. Its thorough traffic facilities, including a highway network, a sea
port and an airport, as well as the high speed rail system, will benefit future
development, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Taichung's complete infrastructure and development potential has made the county
a preferred investment destination, Huang said, adding that investment amount of
the Central Taiwan Science Park which covers the county has reached NT$1.7
trillion (US$55 billion) within five years.</P>
      <P>Bonilla told Huang that Taiwan gives her a homey feeling because she was born in
Taiwan and studied at the Morrison Academy--an international Christian school--
in Taichung City, which borders Taichung County in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She also invited Huang to visit suburban Contra Costa which has a population of
about 1 million to gain a better understanding of the sister county.</P>
      <P>The two counties forged sisterhood ties in 1983, and since then has enjoyed a
solid friendship and started many cooperation and exchanges. In 2004, the two
sides exchanged views on promoting policies on environmental protection,
including water resources, processing of waste, green architecture, and urban
development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Beijing will not make major changes in Taiwan policy: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is not expected to make any major shift in its policy toward Taiwan in
the near future, even though the Kuomintang (KMT), which has vowed to improves
ties with China, will return to power May 20, according to a statement issued
Monday by the Taipei-based Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Although it is widely hoped that the KMT's presidential election victory last
month will bring about a breakthrough in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Taiwan
should not be too optimistic because many uncertainties still exist between the
two sides, the statement said.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou will assume office May 20, ending eight years in
office for the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The statement came after the council called an advisory meeting on the
development of Taiwan-China relations after the presidential election.</P>
      <P>The statement quoted meeting participants as saying that China has a consistent
stance on Taiwan and that it is unlikely China will make a massive policy
adjustment in the short term.</P>
      <P>At the moment, China is believed to be adopting a "wait-and-see" attitude toward
the new KMT government, the statement went on.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, advisory experts said the two sides are likely to resume talks and
suggested that government agencies start to enhance the abilities of their
negotiating  teams,  prioritize  future negotiation agendas and conduct
political risk assessments.</P>
      <P>They added, however, that no timetable should be set for each agenda.</P>
      <P>Some experts also said that China is generally expected to ease its diplomatic
suppression of Taiwan after the elections, but in fact, it had begun blocking
Taiwan's participation in the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the highest
decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO) -- prior to the
elections.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that in early March, China asked other
countries to cooperate with Beijing to block Taiwan's attempts to join the WHA
at the annual meeting slated for May 19-24.</P>
      <P>In addition, the experts went on, it was also reported that Chinese President Hu
Jintao might sign a communique during a visit to Japan in May to further limit
Taiwan's international space.</P>
      <P>Precautionary measures must be taken soon, they suggested.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, other experts said Beijing had yet to finalize its interpretation of
the results of the election and two accompanying referendums on Taiwan's U.N.
membership bid, neither of which cleared the threshold required for them to be
considered valid.</P>
      <P>As a result, it is not clear whether Beijing will shift its Taiwan policy from
opposing  Taiwan independence  to promoting unification between Taiwan and
China, they said.</P>

      <P>Weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China that, according to President-
elect Ma Ying-jeou, will begin July 1, will require some key accompanying
measures to ensure that they are profitable, Taipei Airlines Association (TAA)
Chairman Su Hung-i said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Su, who was elected March 24 as the new head of the TAA, made the comments
during an unofficial meeting with reporters.</P>
      <P>The TAA was commissioned by the government in 2005 to conduct bilateral
aviation  talks with its Chinese  counterpart,  the Cross-Strait Shipping
Exchange Association, in a bid to set up direct transport links between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>The two organizations succeeded in making direct cross-strait charter flights a
reality for four major festivals -- Lunar New Year, Tomb-Sweeping Day, Dragon
Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>Regular direct air travel and shipping services are not available across the
strait due to the political stalemate between the two sides since 1949.</P>
      <P>However, Su voiced concern that custom from China-based Taiwanese businessmen
alone will not be sufficient to sustain weekend charter flights, despite the
fact that there are no technical difficulties in offering such flights based on
the current platform for direct holiday charter flights.</P>
      <P>This means, Su said, that Chinese tourists must also be allowed to visit Taiwan
using the planned weekend charter flights in order to boost passenger loads and
ensure at least 60 percent capacity, he explained.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the TAA will call a meeting of Taipei-based aviation companies
to explore their demands in anticipation of the establishment of the weekend
flights and relay their needs and expectations to the relevant government
authorities.</P>
      <P>Ma repeatedly promised before his March 22 election victory that direct weekend
cross-strait charter flights will kick off July 1, to eventually pave the way
for regularly scheduled flights between the two sides. He also pledged that
Chinese tourists will be allowed to visit Taiwan from that same day.</P>
      <P>The  president-elect  has  promised  that  Taiwan  Taoyuan International Airport
in northern Taiwan and Kaohsiung International Airport in southern Taiwan will
handle direct flights to and from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xiamen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government urged to subsidize cervical cancer vaccine</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Medical professionals in Taiwan would like to see the government subsidizing the
cost of cervical cancer vaccines,  and are suggesting  that there  is room for
price negotiations as there are two types of approved vaccines on the market, an
obstetrics and gynecology doctor said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-fang, a gynecologist at National Taiwan University Hospital, said the
government should encourage the use of the two vaccines to help lower the risk
of cervical cancer and to reduce medical costs.</P>
      <P>Neither of the two vaccines is included on the list of treatments covered by
National Health Insurance and a complete set costs over NT$10,000 (US$330),
Cheng said, adding that the price is too high for disadvantaged women.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) on Monday approved a second cervical cancer
vaccine, which is delivered in the form of three injections and is recommended
for females between the ages of 10 and 25 to offer protection against the virus
that causes most cases of cervical cancer.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng,  the vaccine spurs the development of antibodies against
human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 and these antibodies are still 100
percent viable in the system five and a half years following vaccination. In
Western advanced countries, 70 percent of cervical cancer victims are found to
have been infected with these two strains of HPV.</P>
      <P>However, the efficacy of the vaccine varies depending on the age of the
recipient, Cheng said, adding that it is two to five times more effective in
females aged 10-15 than in the age group of 16-25.</P>
      <P>It will require more than five years of further research to determine whether
the newly approved vaccine can also provide long-term protection for women over
25, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>In October 2006, the DOH approved the first type of cervical cancer vaccine,
which is delivered in three doses and is recommended for females aged 9 to 26.</P>
      <P>The two vaccines are designed to block the most common strains of human
papillomavirus (HPV) -- types 16 and 18 -- which cause 70 percent of cervical
cancer cases in Europe and the U.S., Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The two vaccines also provide cross-protection against HPV types 52 and 58 which
are associated with cervical cancer, and are also effective against HPV types 6
and 11 which cause genital warts, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the common HPV strains in Taiwan are slightly different from those
usually found in Europe and the U.S. Research carried out by foreign experts on
virus samples collected in Taiwan last year showed that 62-63 percent of
cervical cancer was caused by HPV types 16 and 18, 8-9 percent by type 58, 7
percent by type 52, 4percent by type 45, and 3-4 percent by type 31.</P>
      <P>Some 17 of the more than 200 types of HPV are associated with cervical cancer.
Most infections caused by HPV disappear within seven to eight months, while some
persist and escalate,  eventually developing into cancer.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, about 5,700 women are diagnosed every year with cervical cancer and
about 900 die of the disease on average, annually, according to Department of
Health statistics.</P>
      <P>Women 30 years old and over in Taiwan are allowed free Pap smear tests for
cervical cancer once a year. The chances of recovery from the disease is said to
be close to 100 percent, if it is discovered early.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government urged to subsidize cervical cancer vaccine</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
04/02/08  10:45:56
(By Ruth Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Medical professionals in Taiwan would like to see the government subsidizing the
cost of cervical cancer vaccines,  and are suggesting  that there  is room for
price negotiations as there are two types of approved vaccines on the market, an
obstetrics and gynecology doctor said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-fang, a gynecologist at National Taiwan University Hospital, said the
government should encourage the use of the two vaccines to help lower the risk
of cervical cancer and to reduce medical costs.</P>
      <P>Neither of the two vaccines is included on the list of treatments covered by
National Health Insurance and a complete set costs over NT$10,000 (US$330),
Cheng said, adding that the price is too high for disadvantaged women.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) on Monday approved a second cervical cancer
vaccine, which is delivered in the form of three injections and is recommended
for females between the ages of 10 and 25 to offer protection against the virus
that causes most cases of cervical cancer.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng,  the vaccine spurs the development of antibodies against
human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 and these antibodies are still 100
percent viable in the system five and a half years following vaccination. In
Western advanced countries, 70 percent of cervical cancer victims are found to
have been infected with these two strains of HPV.</P>
      <P>However, the efficacy of the vaccine varies depending on the age of the
recipient, Cheng said, adding that it is two to five times more effective in
females aged 10-15 than in the age group of 16-25.</P>
      <P>It will require more than five years of further research to determine whether
the newly approved vaccine can also provide long-term protection for women over
25, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>In October 2006, the DOH approved the first type of cervical cancer vaccine,
which is delivered in three doses and is recommended for females aged 9 to 26.</P>
      <P>The two vaccines are designed to block the most common strains of human
papillomavirus (HPV) -- types 16 and 18 -- which cause 70 percent of cervical
cancer cases in Europe and the U.S., Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The two vaccines also provide cross-protection against HPV types 52 and 58 which
are associated with cervical cancer, and are also effective against HPV types 6
and 11 which cause genital warts, Cheng said.</P>

      <P>The office of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou is still negotiating with the U.S.
government over his request to visit the United States before his May 20
inauguration, one of Ma's aides said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the negotiations will be made public as soon as the sides come to
a decision, said Ma's spokesman, Lo Chih-chiang.</P>
      <P>Lo was responding to a report that Ma has withdrawn his request, which has
created a dilemma for Washington because it would like to see better relations
with Taipei but may worry about irritating China by allowing a visit by Taiwan's
president-elect.</P>
      <P>Douglas Paal, former director of the American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT's)
Taipei Office, told the Central News Agency Tuesday in Washington D.C. that it
would be very difficult for Ma to have his wish fulfilled because the
administration of President George W. Bush has its own concerns.</P>
      <P>Paal said he heard that Ma had retracted his visit request, but added that the
information had not been verified.</P>
      <P>Ma raised the possibility of visiting the United States before he is sworn in
during a meeting with incumbent AIT Taipei Office Director Stephen Young last
week.</P>
      <P>Over the past few days, there have been reports that Washington has rejected
Ma's request.</P>
      <P>During his visit to Taiwan last week, AIT Chairman Raymond Burghardt reportedly

(By Lin Yu-li and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of a pro-Taiwan group in the Hungarian Parliament proposed new
initiatives Tuesday to enhance business and trade ties between Hungary and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jozsef Ekes, chairman of the parliamentarian Hungary-Taiwan Friendship
Association, said that with bilateral exchanges between Hungary and Taiwan
continuing to grow, a Taiwan-Hungary business and trade association should be
established to help deepen trade, technology exchanges and investment between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Ekes said his group is more than willing to help Hungary-based Taiwan companies
make inroads into the vast European Union market, using Hungary as a
springboard.</P>
      <P>Hungary joined the EU as a member in 2004, and its total bilateral trade with
Taiwan has more than doubled since then, growing from US$354.98 million in 2004
to US$873.88 million in 2007. Exports from Taiwan to Hungary accounted for 92
percent of that trade last year.</P>
      <P>Ekes made the remarks in a speech at a luncheon in Budapest Tuesday hosted by
Kao Shuo-tai, Taiwan's representative to Hungary, in honor of members of the
Hungary-Taiwan Friendship Association.</P>
      <P>Ekes, who visited Taiwan last month to obverse the presidential election,  said
he was impressed  by what he saw in Taiwan, specifically praising the fast and
accurate counting of the vote and the high level of participation of Taiwan's
young voters.</P>
      <P>He said he believes that after the presidential election -- won by opposition
Kuomintang candidate Ma Ying-jeou with more than 58 percent of the vote --
cross-Taiwan Strait relations are expected to be less tense in the years to
come.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's democratic election has established an exceptionally good example for
China to emulate," he added.</P>
      <P>Kao said he appreciated the support Ekes' group has given Taiwan. He also
promised that his office will make every effort to help strengthen bilateral
exchanges between the two countries' business sectors so as to create a positive
investment climate for both countries.</P>

      <P>A 27-year-old British English teacher kicked off an around-the-island run in
Keelung, northern Taiwan, Wednesday aimed at raising funds to help patients of
rare disorders in Taiwan and cancer patients in Britain.</P>
      <P>Neil O'Maonaigh-Lennon, who has taught English in Taiwan for just over a year,
launched his month-long run from Keelung's Chungcheng Park accompanied by
Keelung Mayor Chang Tung-jung and a group of foreign nationals and Taiwanese
marathoners.</P>
      <P>Mayor Chang presented O'Maonaigh-Lennon with a "thank you" certificate and a
donation as tokens of appreciation for the compassion the marathoner has shown
to Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>O'Maonaigh-Lennon, who tells people to call him "O'Neil" because his name is
long and difficult to pronounce, said he will attempt to run 42 kilometers --
the length of a marathon -- every day in his bid to raise funds for the Taiwan
Foundation for Rare Disorders and Cancer Research UK.</P>
      <P>From Keelung, O'Maonaigh-Lennon headed to Jioufen -- a hilly town located near
an abandoned gold mine that has become a popular tourist destination -- and
Pingsi -- a sleepy mountainous village -- in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>He will then run to the northeastern city of Yilan and the eastern counties of
Hualien and Taitung before arriving in the southernmost county of Pingtung.</P>
      <P>From Pingtung's  National Kenting Park --  located at the southernmost tip of
Taiwan proper -- the runners plan to turn north to the west-coast counties of
Kaohsiung, Tainan, Chiayi and Yunlin, in that order.</P>
      <P>After arriving in Taichung City, central Taiwan, they will continue to head
north, eventually arriving in Taipei City on April 29 and wrapping up the 30-day
around-the-island run in Guandu -- a wild bird santuary town from where the
Danshuei River flows out to the Taiwan Strait -- on April 30.</P>
      <P>There are an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people in Taiwan suffering from rare
disorders, with only about 15 doctors trained in the special diseases, according

the chance to visit Singapore later this month thanks to the kindness of local
councilors and their own efforts over the past year in raising funds to make
their dream come true.</P>
      <P>The 37 students from Sing Nan Primary School in the eastern county will depart
for Singapore on April 14 for a five-day visit to engage in exchanges with
elementary students in the city-state and show off their unique unicycling
skills.</P>
      <P>In recent years, elementary students from Hong Kong, Singapore and other foreign
places have visited the school in Jhuangwei on exchange programs, helping local
students broaden their perspectives.</P>
      <P>However, according to Sing Nan's principal Liu Hsi-hsin, many of the students at
the school often asked him when it would be their turn to travel abroad for
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Liu said he responded to the students' questions by pointing out that the
foreign students received support from their governments in traveling to Taiwan
but that if the students at Sing Nan wanted to travel abroad, they would have to
pay for the trips themselves.</P>
      <P>The strong desire of the students touched the hearts of faculty as well as the
students' parents, who together came up with a "making dreams come true" plan
last year to raise funds for the students' travel abroad.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the parents, staff and students set up stands at major events at
the school or other locations around the township to sell handicrafts and local
delicacies,  such as peanut candy, cucumbers pickled in soya sauce and roselle
preserves, that they had made themselves.</P>
      <P>The students' efforts attracted the attention of several Yilan County councilors
and other county residents and moved them to help the students achieve their
dream.</P>
      <P>Through their hard work and the kindness of the councilors and members of the
local community, the students were able to raise about NT$500,000 (US$16,500)
over the course of the year.</P>
      <P>The figure is enough to cover over half the cost of the Singapore trip, with
each student only having to pay NT$8,000, and poor students only having to pay
NT$4,000.</P>
      <P>During their trip, the students will visit the Binhai Art Centre, the Singapore
Underwater World, the Science Centre, and many other sites, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Liu said that in addition to sightseeing, the students will also put on a
unicycle performance at Hong Wen Elementary School and donate four unicycles to
schools in the city-state to spread this unique form of exercise abroad.</P>

      <P>The government will continue to negotiate with Washington on ways to tackle
trade barriers that the United States says are preventing it from gaining full
access to Taiwan's market, a Bureau of Foreign Trade official said recently.</P>
      <P>The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) on March 28 released its 2008
National Trade Estimate Report (NTE) on the status of 62 trading partners,
noting significant barriers to U.S. trade and investment and the USTR's response
to those barriers.</P>
      <P>The report said the U.S.' access to Taiwan's market continued to suffer from
business software piracy, counterfeit pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical  pricing,
restrictions on U.S.  beef and other restrictions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Bilateral negotiations with the U.S. have been held on these trading concerns,
showing Taiwan' s sincerity in dealing with the U.S., " Hsu Chun-fang, deputy
director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu stressed that the bureau has responded to U.S. concerns through the Economic
Division under the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the
U.S.</P>
      <P>Although the NTE report raised a number of concerns over barriers to Taiwan's
market, it presented a generally positive view of Taiwan's trade policies,
including  measures on standards and inspection and export subsidies, she said.</P>
      <P>"The report has also made reference to the positive outcomes of the meeting on
Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) held last July in Washington
D.C., in aspects of agriculture, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), and
government procurement," she noted.</P>
      <P>In its report, the USTR said it would give its highest priority to eradicating
trade barriers by pushing for congressional approval of free trade agreements
that had already being signed with Colombia, Panama and South Korea, and
expediting the Doha round of negotiations under the World Trade Organization
(WTO) framework.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The office of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou requested the state postal company
Wednesday to postpone the issuance of stamps marking his May 20 inauguration,
calling the "Taiwan" marking on local postage stamps "controversial."</P>
      <P>Ma's office said in a statement that the matter should only be dealt with after
Ma's inauguration because there are other more important issues on the
president-elect's agenda.</P>
      <P>Sources close to Ma said, however, that he believes the country's official title
should be used on stamps because they are symbolic of a country's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's post office has issued stamps to mark the inauguration of the country's
president since 1996, when Lee Teng-hui became Taiwan's first directly elected
president.</P>
      <P>The state-owned post office has printed "Taiwan" in Chinese and English on its
postage stamps rather than "Republic of China" since changing its name from
"Chunghwa Post Co." to "Taiwan Post Co." in February 2007.</P>
      <P>The change was made as part of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration's efforts to change the names of state-owned enterprises that
contain references to China. "Chunghwa" means "Chinese" or "China" in the
Chinese language.</P>
      <P>The DPP argued that the name rectification campaign would help avoid confusion
resulting from Taiwan-based organizations carrying names that were similar to
those used by organizations in China.</P>
      <P>However, during a recent interview with the media after his March 22 election,
Ma argued Chunghwa Post Co.'s name change was "unlawful" because it has yet to
complete the required legal procedures.</P>
      <P>The statement released by Ma's office referred to the company as "Chunghwa Post
Co." rather than "Taiwan Post Co."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hualien County promotes non-toxic farming with restaurant chain</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 2 (CNA)
04/02/08  16:29:39
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hualien county government's Agriculture Bureau formed an alliance with the
Su Hang restaurant chain in Taipei Wednesday to promote non-toxic farming and
the idea of sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-shuei, director of the Kuang Feng Farmers' Association, said that by
forming the alliance, the Hualien county government hopes that people will
become more aware about agricultural products from the county and will be able
to identify with the idea of non-toxic farming.</P>
      <P>The Su Hang restaurant is famous for its Jiangsu-Zhejiang cuisine, which is
normally considered salty, oily and unhealthy.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the general public will associate products of non-toxic farming
with `health and quality,' " he added. "We expect this kind of cooperation will
create a win-win situation for consumers, restaurants and farmers."</P>
      <P>Non-toxic farming in Taiwan was launched by Hualien Magistrate Hsieh Shen-shan
in 2004 to provide agricultural products that are grown organically without
synthetic fertilizers,  pesticides or livestock feed additives. The
certification process is in accordance with legal standards to maintain soil
productivity and control pests.</P>
      <P>There are several differences  between organic farming and non-toxic farming --
regular tests are carried out by 15 qualified inspectors on the farms rather
than having samples submitted by farmers themselves as is the case with organic
farming testing.</P>
      <P>In addition, all products must pass an examination 10 days before going to
market. Non-toxic farming includes agriculture, fish and livestock,  while
organic farming focuses more on agricultural products.</P>
      <P>"There are three goals of promoting non-toxic farming -- to let consumers eat
healthy food, to protect the environment and to help agricultural
transformation, " said Chen Hsiou-ching, spokeswoman of the non-toxic farming
group.</P>
      <P>She said non-toxic agriculture is high-quality agriculture that not only
guarantees an income for farmers but also pushes the economic development of
Hualien County.</P>
      <P>"It is also a concept of sustainable development, " she said, adding that "with
the increased incomes, more and more farmers will want to become involved in
non-toxic farming and therefore our environment will improve."</P>
      <P>Besides "green" agricultural methods, all products of non-toxic farming use
environmentally friendly packaging materials such as polylactic acid (PLA), a
biodegradable resin derived from cornstarch.</P>
      <P>Chen said that every product has an agricultural practice certificate in the
form of a sticker that shows the traceability of the product -- who grew it, and
when and how it was made.</P>
      <P>"By knowing where the product comes from, consumers feel safer and many of them
have become regular customers," she went on.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the non-toxic farming project has also generated a surprising
windfall, in that "many farmers gain an enormous sense of accomplishment after
switching to non-toxic farming because they are playing the role of a `food
doctor, ' providing healthy food to customers," she said.</P>
      <P>Exhibitions for non-toxic farming products were organized by the Hualien county
government in Macau and Toronto in 2006 and 2007, respectively, with great
success. At present, the project includes 368 farmers in Hualien County, as well
as five logistical centers. Consumers can also order non-toxic products through
the Internet.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) is planning to offer scholarships to allow
outstanding students from Latin America to pursue master's or doctorates or
learn mandarin Chinese in Taiwan, ministry officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Under a recently reached agreement with 17 leading universities in Central and
South America, the MOE is set to offer 20 scholarships for students from the
region, according to officials from the ministry's  Bureau  of International
Cultural  and Educational Relations.</P>
      <P>The bureau made the decision to offer the scholarships after faculty members
from National Chiao Tung University traveled to Latin America Feb. 28-March 7
for a meeting with superintendents from the 17 national universities named in
the agreement that was struck during the meeting.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau's plan, 10 scholarships, amounting to NT$25,000 (US$828)
per student per month, will be made available for three years in the case of
doctoral students and two years in the case of master's students.</P>
      <P>Another 10 scholarships, amounting to NT$20,000 per student per month, will be
offered for mandarin Chinese study in Taiwan for periods ranging from three
months to a year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The first batch of scholarship winners are expected to arrive in Taiwan in
September at the earliest, they noted.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the students, after pursuing their advanced studies in Taiwan,
will eventually become members of the elite in their home countries and will be
able to contribute to further consolidating bilateral business or diplomatic
exchanges with Taiwan, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Most of the scholarship winners will study at National Chiao Tung University in
Hsinchu City, northern Taiwan, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that most of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies are in Central and
South America, the number of students from that part of the world who study in
Taiwan accounts for less than 1 percent of all foreign students studying here,
they added.</P>

      <P>The Watoto Children's Choir, which continues its tour of Taiwan with a
performance in Hsinchu City Wednesday night, has called attention in Taiwan to
the devastating impact of AIDS in Africa and around the world.</P>
      <P>Composed today of 18 orphans aged between 7 and 13 whose parents died of AIDS,
the Watoto Children's Choir has staged many fundraising concerts around the

the devastation the continent has suffered from war.</P>
      <P>Watoto, the name of the village in Uganda where the choir got its start, means
"children" in Swahili, one of the most widely spoken languages in East Africa.</P>
      <P>The choir is touring Taiwan at the invitation of World Vision Taiwan and is

      <P>According to a statement issued by the university, Professor Liou</P>
      <P>Yuei-an was  notified of the honor by the academy in mid-February and has
accepted an invitation to attend the award ceremony in the Russian capital of
Moscow in May.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chen-shui, an Academia Sinica member and a professor at National Taiwan
University, in 2001 became the first Taiwanese member of the 900-member Russian
academy.</P>
      <P>Liou said in a press interview that he was "surprised" at the news of the award,
and he thanked the Cabinet-level National Science Council and the government-
funded National Space Organization for their support over the years.</P>
      <P>Liou, the sitting director of NCU's Center for Space and Remote Sensing
Research, specialized in the areas of remote sensing and atmospheric science
research, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Liou, aged 45, earned two master's degrees and two doctorates from the
University of Michigan in six years. After graduation, he joined the NCU faculty
and participated  in various satellite observation projects, including France's
SPOT, Germany's CHAMP, LANDSAT and GPS/ Met of the United States, and Taiwan's
FORMOSAT-2 and FORMOSAT-3.</P>
      <P>Liu and his team at NCU developed an innovative technique in the process --
radio occultation observation -- in which the researchers first record the
signals sent by a global positioning system (GPS) and the signals received by
low Earth orbit satellites, and then compare the variances in two sets of data
to reconstruct the atmospheric conditions and gravitational waves in the
transmission pathway.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Presidential Office dismisses allegations over CAL's aircraft deal</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office on Tuesday rebutted reports that the office had tried to
orchestrate a major aircraft purchase deal by China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's
largest air carrier, before the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"The reports were by no means true," the office said in a statement, adding that
the deal was "strictly CAL's business considerations, which had nothing to do
with the Presidential Office."</P>
      <P>The office said it regretted the "groundless" and "irresponsible" reports,
especially because the reporters had not checked with the Presidential Office
first.</P>
      <P>The office was responding to reports by "Next," a weekly magazine which said CAL
Chairman Ringo Chao hastily inked a NT$120 billion (US$3.97 billion) agreement
on Jan. 25 to buy 20 A350-900 aircrafts from European manufacturer Airbus,
although the aircraft is still under development and will not be delivered until
2015.</P>
      <P>CAL has confirmed it has signed a deal to buy that many of the aircrafts from
Airbus at the price reported.</P>
      <P>Several opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers in the Legislative Yuan's
transportation committee on Wednesday criticized the deal.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chen Keng-teh asked why the CAL paid a down payment of 20
percent, or around NT$27 billion, instead of the usual 3 percent, adding that
"it is a reasonable doubt that the money is a form of kickback."</P>
      <P>Another KMT legislator Huang Chao-hsun questioned why the final deal inked was
NT$16 billion more expensive than the highest price CAL would pay, according to
guidelines set by former CAL Chairman Philip Wei.</P>
      <P>Oliver Yu, Transportation and Communications vice minister who concurrently
serves as a board director of China Aviation Development Foundation, CAL's
largest shareholder, said at the committee meeting that CAL submitted the
proposed deal last December to be considered at a foundation board meeting,
which was presided by Tsai Duei, who is Transportation and Communications
minister and chairman of the foundation.</P>
      <P>The meeting, after affirming CAL's need to upgrade its fleet and maintenance
capacity, "respected the airline's professional decision and approved the deal,"
Yu said.</P>
      <P>Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General Billy Chang also said
the administration agreed to CAL's plan to phase out its aging fleet.</P>
      <P>But both of them said that they "were not aware of the financial arrangement in
the deal."</P>
      <P>The United Daily News, a mass-circulation local paper, quoted CAL Chairman Chao
as saying Tuesday that the company's decision to buy from Airbus is because it
offered better terms than Boeing, the U.S. aircraft manufacturer.</P>
      <P>Chao said that Airbus could deliver the aircrafts in 2015, while Boeing's 787
planes will only be delivered in 2018.</P>
      <P>Chao denied that the deal was more expensive than originally estimated, saying
that the company has estimated that buying one A350 aircraft will save around
US$5 million in fuel costs and loans a year.</P>
      <P>The deal includes 14 firm orders with a further six on option for aircrafts with
a capacity of approximately 366 seats.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet reports on achievements in transportation, infrastructure</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 2 (CNA)
04/02/08  18:22:36
(Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet on Wednesday issued a report on the achievements  of the Democratic
Progressive  Party  (DPP) administration's ministries and agencies in charge of
transportation and public infrastructure during the past eight years of DPP
rule.</P>
      <P>It was the first  of a series  of such reports  on the accomplishments of the
various ministries and agencies under the Executive Yuan to be issued over the
coming weeks before the May 20 inauguration of Ma Ying-jeou from the opposition
Kuomintang. Ma was elected in a decisive victory on March 22 as the next
president.</P>
      <P>Speaking with reporters, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said the Executive Yuan will
issue reports on its administrative record in the areas of economics, finance,
public security, education and culture, and governance during its final weeks.</P>
      <P>Chang said the reports are being issued for three reasons -- to let the public
know about the administration's achievements while in power, to provide a last
chance for reflection before the transfer of power in May, and to reflect on
whether the administration has come through on its promises, and if it hasn't
done so in some instances, to examine the reasons for this.</P>
      <P>Ministries and agencies in charge of transportation and public infrastructure,
including the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the Construction
and Planning Agency under the Ministry of the Interior and the Water Resources
Agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, all have done an outstanding job
in implementing President Chen Shui-bian's policies in these areas, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that during the DPP administration's eight years in power, the total
length of Taiwan's freeways has increased by 127.3 percent, while the total
miles of expressways that have been widened has increased by 427.57 percent.</P>
      <P>He further said that following delays in its construction due to factors,
including flooding, the Hsueshan Tunnel was finally opened in June 2006,
becoming Southeast Asia's longest tunnel at 12. 9 kilometers.</P>
      <P>The premier also noted that all sections of Taiwan's High Speed Railway came
into operation on March 2, 2007, with the total number of passengers surpassing
19.6 million since its inauguration. He added that the railway has become one of
Taiwan's main modes of long-distance travel and has provided a stimulus to the
nation's overall economy.</P>
      <P>On the tourism industry front, Chang said the government has invested a lot of
resources over the past eight years to upgrade its quality. He added that the
efforts have borne fruit, with the number of tourist arrivals jumping by 50
percent since 2000 when the DPP administration came to power.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the administration has done a lot to improve the nation's
water conservation, including establishing a Water Resource Agency as well as a
committee to deal with related problems.</P>
      <P>The administration has also carried out several flood-control projects,
including a major project on the Keelung River, Chang noted. He added that the
Keelung River project proved effective when Typhoon Nali hit the island, with
over 1,000 hectares of land being spared from flooding because of the project.</P>
      <P>Chang also pointed to the various "green area" projects launched by the
administration over the years, which have helped improve the quality of life in
communities around the nation.</P>
      <P>He added that the administration allocated NT$16.18 billion on renewal  projects
in central and southern  Taiwan to upgrade residential communities in those
areas.</P>
      <P>As part of efforts to improve the environment in townships and villages, the
administration effectively utilized private investment to increase the water
treatment facilities in these areas, noting that the ratio of households
connected to sewage treatment systems increased from just 7.1 percent when the
DPP came to power to 17.5 percent at present.</P>
      <P>Chang also noted that rising construction material prices over the past year
have presented the agencies in charge of public infrastructure development with
a major challenge. In response, the Executive Yuan set up a task force on
stabilizing prices as well as a construction material price adjustment mechanism
to keep the impact of inflation to a minimum so that public infrastructure
development projects could continue unimpeded.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the premier thanked the staff of the various ministries and
agencies in charge of transportation and public infrastructure for their efforts
and strong performance over the past eight years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Group calls for focus on safety, happiness of children in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan ranked 12th but did poorly in categories that assessed "happiness" and
"safety, " compared to 21 advanced countries in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), a local child welfare promotion organization
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Child Welfare  League  Foundation  (CWLF)  called  for President-elect Ma
Ying-jeou and his incoming administration to fulfill their campaign promises of
promoting child welfare afer they take office on May 20 as the non-governmental
organization released a report on the state of local children.</P>
      <P>"Children are the future of our country. Only by promoting the welfare of our
children can we create a harmonious society with a brighter future," said CWLF
Chairwoman Feng Yien.</P>
      <P>The report, which was based on UNICEF's 2007 report on the welfare of children
and a survey conducted in Taiwan last year, reviewed the state of Taiwan's
children under five indices, namely economy, health, education, happiness and
safety.</P>
      <P>The results show that Taiwan, calculated along with the figures from the 21 OECD
countries, ranked 12th overall, while Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, in
that order, topped the list.</P>
      <P>Taiwan lagged behind in the categories of "happiness" and "safety, "ranking 19th
and 16th, respectively, an indication that much more could be done to make
children in the country feel safer and more satisfied with their lives.</P>
      <P>Only around 60 percent of the children in the survey said that they often have
dinner with the whole family, which was lower than the average 78.5 percent
among other countries and far below Italy's 93.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Also, 21.7 percent of the children in Taiwan said that they often feel lonely --
a figure that shows the need for greater parental attention and companionship.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan ranked well in the "health" index, placing 3rd behind Sweden and
Spain. The report indicated that most of the children in Taiwan eat fruits and
have breakfast every day.</P>
      <P>Chairwoman Feng offered six proposals under which the government could improve
child welfare, including increasing the education budget, establishing a
community care system for pregnant women and infants, and amending the
Children's and Juvenile's Welfare Law every two or three years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors have begun a probe into suspected irregularities in a major aircraft
purchase deal by China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's largest air carrier, the
director of the Special Investigation Unit of the Supreme Prosecutors Office
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan said that after recent reports about possible irregularities
involved in CAL's NT$120 billion (US$3.97 billion) deal with European aircraft
manufacturer Airbus to buy 20 A350-900s, the unit has taken the initiative to
conduct a probe.</P>
      <P>"The prosecutors have questioned related personnel of CAL and China Aviation
Development Foundation on the matter, " Chen said. The foundation is the largest
shareholder of CAL.</P>
      <P>His remarks came as the weekly magazine "Next" reported Wednesday that CAL
Chairman Ringo Chao hastily signed a NT$120 billion agreement to buy the
aircraft from European aircraft manufacturer Airbus although the aircraft is
still under development and will not be delivered until 2015.</P>
      <P>The deal was NT$16 billion more expensive than the highest price CAL would pay
according to guidelines set by Philip Wei, former CAL chairman, the reports also
said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the prosecutors understand that 14 of the 20 aircrafts will be
delivered starting 2015, which will phase out CAL's present six A340-300
passenger aircrafts. The deal also includes an option to buy a further six
aircrafts.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have looked into related information provided by CAL and its
foundations, and summoned personnel for questioning to see if the deal has run
counter to normal practice, and are looking into whether the down payment is
unusually high, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"The prosecutors are looking along the line of breach of trust, dereliction of
duty as well as embezzlement," Chen added.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislators on Wednesday questioned the
Transportation and Communications Vice Minister Oliver Yu and Civil Aeronautics
Administration Director-General Billy Chang over the matter, but both of them
said they "were not aware of the financial arrangement in the purchase deal."</P>
      <P>Yu, a board director of China Aviation Development Foundation, said CAL

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan qualified to be WHO observer: Cabinet spokesman</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
04/02/08  19:24:40
(By Howard Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey reaffirmed Wednesday that Taiwan is qualified
to join the World Health Organization (WHO) as an observer, adding that the
issue of what name the country should use in its membership bid "is open to
discussion."</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks prior to the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly
(WHA) , the WHO's governing body, scheduled to open May 19 in Geneva, one day
before President-elect Ma Ying-jeou takes office.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, Taiwan has been trying unsuccessfully to obtain observer status at
the WHA. Last year, the government changed its policy and applied for formal
membership of the WHO, a move that was opposed by the United States, the
European Union and Japan.</P>
      <P>Raymond Burghardt, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, reiterated last
week during a visit to Taiwan that the U.S supports WHA observer status for
Taiwan but opposes its application for WHO membership.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was forced to leave the United Nations and subsequently all
U.N.-affiliated organizations such as the WHO when the People's Republic of
China was admitted to the U.N. in 1971.</P>
      <P>Commending Taiwan on its contributions to world health and describing them as
important and remarkable, Shieh said that "without Taiwan's participation in the
WHO, the network of epidemic prevention and control around the world will be
inadequate."</P>
      <P>He said the casualties caused by the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) could have been reduced if Taiwan had been part of the
international health network, as it would have enabled the country to receive
more medical aid and get better and quicker access to the most up-to-date
information on the disease.</P>
      <P>According to the Department of Health under the Executive Yuan, 664 SARS cases
were reported, 73 of which proved fatal, in the 2003 outbreak.</P>
      <P>Shieh continued that this year, work on Taiwan's attempt to join the WHO is
already under way and added that "our goal will not be changed" despite the new
administration set to take the reins of power May 20.</P>
      <P>The government will continue preparatory work for Taiwan's participation in the
WHO, regardless of the Cabinet resignation that will take place in mid-May,
Shieh said.</P>
      <P>As for the name Taiwan intends to use for the WHO membership application, Shieh
said it will depend on the decision of President Chen Shui-bian and the relevant
government organizations, including the Presidential Office, the National
Security Council, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Government Information
Office.</P>

      <P>A stalwart supporter of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) allegedly
committed suicide Wednesday by setting himself afire in an apparent expression
of grief and indignation over the party's loss in two major elections this year,
sources close to the DPP said.</P>
      <P>Liao Shu-hsin, 45, director of the Taipei operation of Voice of the Ocean  --
an underground  pro-independence  radio station headquartered in Taichung,
central Taiwan -- was found dead in a fire at his office in Hsinchuang, Taipei
County around 1 a.m. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taipei County police said they have launched an investigation into the case to
find out why and how Liao died.</P>
      <P>Chang Chih-mei, CEO of Voice of the Ocean, said the radio station is opposed to
Liao's extreme means of expressing his anger and indignation, but added that the
station will do whatever it can to help Liao's family in the wake of the tragic
incident.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Liao had been in low spirits ever since the DPP presidential
candidate  Frank Hsieh lost the election to his Kuomintang (KMT) rival Ma Ying-
jeou on March 22 on the heels of the DPP's crushing defeat in the Jan. 12
legislative polls.</P>
      <P>"Liao also made a will after the elections, anticipating that the dream of
building a 'Republic of Taiwan' had become even more distant," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He added that many supporters of and listeners to Voice of the Ocean have shaved
their heads in an expression of their grief and anger over the DPP election
losses.</P>
      <P>At a news conference Wednesday, DPP caucus whip William conveyed condolences to
Liao's family over his supposed self-immolation, and urged the party's
supporters to "look forward" and to view the results and process of the just-
concluded presidential election as a victory for Taiwan's democratization,
rather than a failure on the part of any individual.</P>
      <P>Lai promised that "the DPP will rise again and return to power and will build
Taiwan into a normal, independent nation."</P>
      <P>He urged all friends of the DPP to join the party's "comeback" efforts, and to
definitely avoid any extreme actions to hurt themselves.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Wednesday, the DPP caucus attributed Liao's alleged
suicide to three possible reasons -- worry that the incoming KMT government will
suppress "freedom of speech" in Taiwan, indignation over governmental efforts to
crack down on underground broadcasting  stations,  and the DPP's bruising defeat
in the presidential election.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang Ching-sen, the vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) , surprised a confirmation meeting on the construction plan
of the Suao-Hualien expressway held Wednesday by abruptly suggesting that the
controversial plan should be left to the new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"The caretaker government should not deprive the new government that will take
office in May of its decision-making right, " said Chang during the meeting.</P>
      <P>The construction of a Suao-Hualien expressway was a campaign promise of
President Chen Shui-bian in 2000.</P>
      <P>Despite also being one of the proposed expressway's environmental impact
assessment (EIA) subcommittee members, Chang has very seldom attended any EIA
meetings.</P>
      <P>He added that the National Expressway Engineering Bureau (NEEB) should amend its
construction plan and hand it over to the new Cabinet after May 20, when the new
administration takes office.</P>
      <P>He also questioned the transport-handling  capacity of the expressway and the
budget for the plan, which has been increased to about NT$12.95 billion instead
of the original NT$9.3 billion due to the rising price of raw materials. This,
he noted, will result in a drop in the benefit-cost ratio.</P>
      <P>Leaving in the middle of the meeting, Chang told reporters that his remarks,
which left the expressway plan in an uncertain situation,  were his personal
opinions and do not necessarily represent the government's position.</P>
      <P>Describing Chang's remarks as "moral and conscientious, " Lin Su-zhen, another
subcommittee member, said however that the CEPD should have shown its position
earlier.</P>
      <P>Asked if the government intends to leave the controversial issue to the new
Cabinet, Lin said there is "reasonable doubt" that this is the case.</P>
      <P>After two-and-a-half hours of discussion, the EIA subcommittee, judging the
documents and data insufficient, demanded that the NEEB complete its report on
the construction plan.</P>
      <P>It was unclear whether the EIA subcommittee will be convened before or after May
20.</P>
      <P>Some subcommittee members also challenged the necessity of the expressway,
saying  that  the NEEB  did not make  sufficient investigations and assessments
of the site, such as geological conditions, security systems and potential for
traffic jams, as well as the impact on the lives of the people in the area, many
of whom are aborigines.</P>
      <P>The 86-km expressway connecting Suao and Hualien along the eastern coast of
Taiwan, is designed to boost the economy of the poorest region of the island.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists say the construction, estimated to take eight to 10 years to
complete, might have a negative impact on the ecology of the region and that the
expressway, with 40 km of tunnels, might be dangerous because of its proximity
to fault lines.</P>

      <P>Some 60.7 percent of local children who responded to a recent survey said their
happiest moments are when they are in their parents' company, according to the
survey results released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey on children's attitudes toward happiness and money was conducted by
international financial conglomerate Citigroup and the If children's theater
company among students at 32 elementary school in Taipei, Hsinchu and Kaohsiung
cities and counties, plus Taichung City, with 2,437 valid samples collected.</P>
      <P>Good health was named by 52.1 percent of the respondents as the thing that makes
them happiest, while 10.7 percent cited travel overseas and just 8.3 percent
cited wealth, according to the survey results.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu County had the highest percentage -- 66.7 percent of the respondents --
who said they feel happiest when they are with their parents, while nobody in
the county said that having a lot of money would make them happier.</P>
      <P>The results also show that 58.5 percent of the respondents receive an allowance

      <P>Hsinchu County had the highest ratio of respondents who said they manage their
finances, with 38.9 percent doing book-keeping, compared with 21 percent -- the
lowest percentage of the regions covered -- in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, most of the Hsinchu respondents said they spend less than 30 percent
of their allowance on eating and entertainment, and save the rest or use it to
buy stationery and books. In comparison, more than 50 percent of the respondents
in Taipei County said they spend most of their allowance on entertainment.</P>

      <P>The International Quit and Win 2008 campaign will start May 2, with a top prize
of NT$600,000 (US$19,750) waiting for smokers who kick the habit, officials of
the Bureau of Health Promotion (BHP) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The biennial International Quit and Win competition was initiated in 1994 by the
National Public Health Institute of Finland and is supported by the World Health
Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Taiwan first joined the competition in 2002, with each contest receiving a warm
response from the public over the years.</P>
      <P>The event in Taiwan is organized by the John Tung Organization, a local non-
profit organization for tobacco control, and the BHP under the Cabinet-level
Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The officials said at a press conference that participants who succeed in
stopping smoking for the four weeks from May 2 will have the chance to win
prizes through a lucky draw.</P>
      <P>The campaign is open to adults older than 18 who have smoked for more than a
year, with each participant requiring one person to serve as his or her witness.</P>
      <P>Actor Ho Hao-chieh and his entertainer wife He Jia Xin attended the press
conference with their son, becoming the first couple to register their
participation in the contest.</P>
      <P>Ho said he wanted to quit smoking for the health of their son, who has allergy
problems.</P>
      <P>"Besides, smoking is quite money-consuming, " Ho said, admitting that the
NT$600,000 prize is very attractive.</P>
      <P>Sun Yueh, a famous entertainer and a permanent volunteer of the John Tung
Foundation who was once a heavy smoker, noted that there are some 4 million
smokers in Taiwan and that he believes their families all hope they will quit
smoking.</P>
      <P>Sun urged all smokers to quit the habit "for the people they love."</P>
      <P>Anyone interested in taking part in the contest should register before  May 1
and can visit  the competition's  Web site at www.e-quit.org for more
information, the organizer said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first Israeli drama to be presented in Taiwan -- a contemporary version of
Sophocles' Antigone -- will be staged at the National Theater in Taipei April 3,
April 5 and April 6, Hsieh Tsui-yu, deputy director of the National Chiang Kai-
shek Cultural Center, announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Antigone is a joint production of Habimah National Theatre of Israel and
Cameri Theatre of Tel Aviv, and is adapted from a Greek tragedy by Sophocles
written in 422 BC. It is directed by Hanan Snir, one of Israel's most prominent
directors who uses a mixture of modern and ancient techniques in the
presentation.</P>
      <P>Noting that the show is the first cooperation project between the National
Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Center, which manages the National Theater and the
National Concert Hall, and Israel in 21 years, Hsieh said he hopes it "will
bring a new experience to all our audiences."</P>
      <P>"Those who deeply love drama cannot miss it, " Hsieh said at a rehearsal press
conference at the National Theater.</P>
      <P>Referring to the program as the fruits of a visit to Israel by Ping Heng, a
former artistic director of the center, Israeli representative to Taiwan,
Raphael Gamzou, said he hoped "there will be more fruits in Taiwan in the
future."</P>
      <P>Because the Antigone underlines the consequences of the deed of a leader on
other people's lives, Gamzou said, "this is a very good example of cultural
exchanges in our (Israeli) democracy and in your (Taiwanese)
democracyKespecially in this fascinatingly political season in your democracy."</P>
      <P>He added that it also reflects the need for the leader of a nation to be
accountable.</P>
      <P>The presentation of the Hebrew version of Antigone with Chinese subtitles is
part of the National Theater's International Theater Festival.</P>

      <P>The government approved an amendment Wednesday to a World Trade Organization
(WTO) agreement that would waive property rights and thus allow underdeveloped
countries access to cheaper generic drugs for fatal diseases such as AIDS.</P>
      <P>The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Council under
the WTO had a proposed compulsory licensing system to authorize pharmaceutical
companies in eligible WTO member states to manufacture and export cheaper
generic drugs to less developed nations, without having to pay the patent
holders.</P>
      <P>The WTO's General Council has asked all its members nations to obtain approval
by their own lawmakers and to notify the WTO no later than December 31, 2009, in
order to make the pharmaceutical products available to less developed countries
that have inadequate funds and medical capacity to deal with fatal diseases.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and some other countries have decided not to take
advantage of the concession, except in cases of national emergency.</P>
      <P>Citing the need to play a responsible role in the international community, the
Cabinet urged that the Legislative Yuan to pass the amendment, following the
Cabinet's approval of the plan Wednesday at its weekly meeting.</P>
      <P>"With its capability to assist other WTO members, Taiwan should serve the
international community by passing the amendment, a gesture that could also
boost the country's status, " said Premier Chang Chun-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The Legislature will first have to approve the amendment, then Taiwan's patent
regulations will also have to be revised to waive the intellectual property
rights on certain drugs, before Taiwan can notify the WTO of its formal adoption
of the measure.</P>
      <P>In 2007, Canada became the first member state to notify the WTO of its
compulsory license to export generic drugs to Rwanda for AIDS treatment.</P>
      <P>The WTO decided to implement paragraph 6 of the 2001 Doha Declaration on the
TRIPS agreement and Public Health in 2003, with the aim of helping to provide
treatment in less developed countries for life threatening diseases.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 1 million students attending 100 local universities will be able to use
copying machines free of charge by the end of this year under the sponsorship of
various local companies, a spokesman for a local advertising company said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At present, Impress Technology Ltd. Corp. has installed copying machines at 40
colleges in northern and central Taiwan to provide free services to students,
said Luis Lu,  president  of the Taipei-based company.</P>
      <P>Describing the free copying machines as a mutually beneficial marketing strategy
between consumers, advertisers and the company, Lu said that each sheet of
copying paper provided in the machines carries a full-color advertisement on one
side from the company's advertisers, whose target customers are aged 18-24.</P>
      <P>Lu said the company copied the new marketing strategy from Japan, where the
strategy has become very popular since 2005 when some Japanese college students
came up with the idea.</P>
      <P>Lu said that in Japan, some vending machines provide free coffee or other
beverages to consumers after an infrared scanner confirms that they have watched
a 30-second commercial played on a screen mounted in the machines.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that in just the past two weeks, 200,000 sheets of the free copying
paper have been used by local college students.</P>
      <P>Tsai Wen-bin, head of a student association at National Taiwan Normal
University, told local newspapers that he and his peers have found the marketing
idea "very attractive."</P>
      <P>"The only downside is that these free sheets cannot be used to print official
documents or reports because of the advertisements on the back," Tsai pointed
out.</P>
      <P>The copying cost for an A4-sized sheet of blank paper is NT$0.7 at schools, NT$1
at copying stores and NT$2 at convenience stores.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has an estimated 164 universities with a combined 1.32 million students.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic minister not to resign over fuel price hike controversy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 2 (CNA)
04/02/08  20:42:50
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L. Chen said Wednesday that he would not
resign over a controversy about whether a price freeze on the state oil company
should be removed to allow it to hike the price of its products after its
private rival did so last week.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement while fielding reporters' questions after a weekly
meeting at the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that he will serve in his post until May 19, the day before
Taiwan's new president will be inaugurated, because he wanted to avoid further
complications in a matter that has turned into a political issue after the March
22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"I have not offered to resign as a way to settle the issue. Besides,
communications between the Executive Yuan and the MOEA remain smooth," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) had, prior to the
election, suggested the Executive Yuan allow CPC Corp., Taiwan to raise its
product prices to reflect its costs due to skyrocketing crude oil prices in
international market.</P>
      <P>But all the political parties asked for a freeze on the company's prices at that
time, and "that's the reason why the MOEA ordered a freeze late last year on the
company's pricing," he explained.</P>
      <P>The MOEA in November 2007 ordered the price freeze in an effort to curb
inflationary pressures, particularly as the legislative and presidential
elections were approaching.</P>
      <P>The state-owned oil supplier adopted a floating pricing mechanism in January
2007 under which it adjusted its domestic fuel prices on a weekly  basis  in
response  to international  crude oil price fluctuations. The system was
replaced by a monthly adjustment mechanism last September.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the MOEA has after the presidential race twice suggested
the Executive Yuan remove the cap on the company, Chen said his ministry has to
respect the decision made by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung to maintain the cap.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang said a day earlier that the Executive Yuan decided to maintain the
state oil provider's product prices at their current levels in April, but
whether it will continue doing so in May will depend on market conditions at
that time.</P>
      <P>Earlier Wednesday, a group of the KMT's legislative caucus members called a news
conference at the Legislative Yuan urging the MOEA to re-impose the floating oil
pricing system by working out complementary measures, including subsidies for
public transportation systems, within two days.</P>
      <P>As a result of the freeze on CPC Corp.'s product prices, the state oil company
is set to incur a loss of about NT$7.5 billion (US$227 million) per month,
acting KMT legislative caucus whip Hsieh Kuo-liang said.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao contended that the company must not continue with
the price caps, arguing that there is no reason why the whole society should
suffer to spare vehicle drivers of price hikes.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the reason why the lawmakers made a resolution late last year
demanding that CPC Corp. not further hike its product prices was because the
state company had hit its government-set target of earnings. The company earned
NT$11.4 billion for the whole of last year, he noted.</P>
      <P>Formosa Petrochemical Corp., Taiwan's biggest private refiner, increased the
price of its gasoline and diesel products by NT$2.8 per liter and NT$3.1 per
liter, respectively, beginning March 29, in response to rising costs. The price
increases will remain in effect until the end of April, the company said.</P>
      <P>The price hike by Formosa Petrochemical has driven many car drivers to purchase
oil at CPC Corp. gasoline stations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>National Palace Museum to display paintings by Chang Da-chien</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Palace Museum has put on display 10 selected paintings of
internationally acclaimed modern Chinese artist Chang Da-chien (1899-1983) from
April 2 to June 25 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his passing.</P>
      <P>Visitors can see Chang's works on the second floor in the west wing of the
museum. The paintings include a self-portrait of Chang, which he painted on his
75th birthday.</P>
      <P>Also on display is a colossal work, "Panorama of Mount Lu," which Chang began to
paint three years before he died but left unfinished. The ambitious work,
measuring nearly two meters high and 10 meters long, incorporates a range of
styles that Chang had mastered in his lifetime. Although one-fifth of the
painting was left undone, it is still considered one of his finest works.</P>
      <P>The museum also opened Chang's former residence in Waishuanghsi, a northern
suburb of Taipei, to the public. The place has been named the Chang Da-chien
Memorial Hall, with the adjoining garden being Chang's final resting place.</P>
      <P>Chang, who wore a long beard and carried a walking stick wherever he went,
created an image of himself as "an ancient figure in a modern time." He has been
hailed as one of the greatest Chinese artists in modern times.</P>
      <P>Chang was born into a wealthy family on May 10, 1899 in Szechuan province,
China. He briefly entered a Buddhist monastery before beginning serious study of
Chinese calligraphy and painting at the age of 19.</P>
      <P>After a three-year stay in Japan with his brother to learn commercial weaving
and textile dyeing, Chang settled in Shanghai in 1919 to study under prominent
artists Tseng Hsi (1861-1930) and Li Jui-ching (1867-1920) . He not only learned
painting techniques from the two teachers, but also developed his talent in
calligraphy and poetry.</P>
      <P>In his early years as an artist, he trained himself by copying the works of
renowned masters before he was able to develop his own style and bring fresh,
innovative elements into traditional Chinese painting.</P>
      <P>His first exhibition of 100 paintings in 1926 was a great success. In 1939,
while China was waging a war against Japanese aggression, he went to the remote
desert outpost of Tunhuang in Gansu province, where he spent more than two years
copying the legendary murals in the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.</P>
      <P>At the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, Chang traveled between Hong Kong,
Taiwan, India and Argentina before he and his family settled down on a farm
outside Sao Paolo, Brazil in 1954. From there, he traveled frequently to major
cities in the United States Europe and Asia to exhibit his paintings.</P>
      <P>He moved from Brazil to California in 1967 and lived there for eight years
before relocating to Taiwan in 1977 and lived in Taipei until his passing at 84.</P>
      <P>In his later years, he combined a unique splashed-ink technique with the
masterly texture strokes of his early years in his works. The prolific artist
left behind some 5,000 paintings, with the motifs ranging from figures, birds
and flowers to landscapes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei to celebrate ICFD, provide better facilities for cyclists</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Department of Transportation (DOT) of the Taipei city government opened a
workshop Wednesday that focused on preparations for International Car Free Day
(ICFD), and vowed to build a friendlier environment for cyclists in the Taiwan
capital.</P>
      <P>In preparation for ICFD, which will be observed on September 22, DOT officials
reported at the workshop on a series of projects linked to the international
event.</P>
      <P>"We don't want to limit ICFD as a one-day activity -- it should be a day when
people try to take more environmentally friendly actions in general, " said DOT
Director Luo Shiaw-shyan, who presided over the workshop. He also suggested that
it should be a day when people vow to better protect the environment.</P>
      <P>On ICFD, the use of private vehicles will be limited to some busy areas and
everyone will be allowed to take public transportation for free, so as to
encourage people to help reduce air pollution, a DOT official said.</P>
      <P>The DOT also announced a series of projects, such as the construction of
additional bike paths in Taipei, to encourage more cycling.</P>
      <P>The DOT said it is undertaking a "rent-a-bike" program similar to that in Paris,
where there are more than 20,600 bicycles available for rent around the clock at
1,451 stations.</P>
      <P>Luo said the DOT plans to build more bicycle lanes in the city, and he called
for more people to choose bicycles over fuel-consuming vehicles as their means
of travel. An exclusive bicycle path will be built along Dunhua North and South
Roads in the downtown area in 2008, he said.</P>
      <P>In Taipei city, 39.9 km of bike-pedestrian paths and 18.6 km of exclusive bike
paths were in service at the end of 2007, the DOT noted.</P>
      <P>The department hopes to build 40.5 km of bike-pedestrian paths and 9.5 km of
exclusive bike paths in 2008, and in three years time to have a total of 150 km
of bike paths in service, Luo said.</P>
      <P>He added that international  visitors  to the 2009 Summer Deaflympics and the
2010 International Flower Exposition, which are both to be held in Taipei, will
be able to utilize the rent-a-bike program and ride along the new paths.</P>
      <P>ICFD, initiated in the 1990s in Europe, was adopted by the Taipei City
government in 2002, with the participation of 3,000 people. Its objective is to
raise awareness of air pollution, reduce greenhouse gas effects and promote the
use of public transportation.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the number of participants in ICFD rose to 65,000, and the utility rate
of public transportation in Taipei City for that year rose to 48.3 percent from
37.8 percent in 2002, according to the DOT.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the ICFD will become a movement in Taipei in the future," said
Luo.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung ordered relevant government  agencies Wednesday to
submit an assessment to the Executive Yuan next week of feasible measures to
help low-income families tackle rising product prices.</P>
      <P>Chang issued the order while presiding over a meeting of a product price
stabilization task force under the Executive Yuan. Officials from the Ministry
of Economic Affairs and Fair Trade Commission reported on the rising costs of
raw materials and their efforts to prevent hoarding and price manipulations in
the local market.</P>
      <P>As global research has found that consumer product prices will continue to climb
this year at a faster pace than last year, the relevant government authorities
must keep a close watch and come up with effective measures to help the
underprivileged combat increasing product prices, although those prices have
remained relatively stable in Taiwan, Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, the authorities concerned were asked to present the
key report following a similar program launched last week by the South Korean
government which banned price hikes on 52 basic items, including eggs, cooking
oil and bread.</P>
      <P>According to a foreign wire service report, fighting inflationary pressure is
the top priority of the South Korean government led by President Lee Myung-bak,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Wednesday that the incoming
administration of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou  will face four crises,
including a dire financial situation.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while addressing a seminar for CEOs in Kaohsiung, southern
Taiwan, at the invitation of the Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission.</P>
      <P>In addition to the present ethnic divisions, tense cross-strait relations,
bipartisan squabbling and slow economic development, the nation also faces
several crises that pose potential threats to its development, Wang said.</P>
      <P>He said that since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took office in 2000,
Taiwan's economic development has stalled.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has slipped to last place among the "four dragons," he said, referring to
Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea as the other three dragons.</P>
      <P>But at a time of stalled economic development and drastic decreases in tax
revenues, the government's debts have continued to climb, he said.</P>
      <P>"Each citizen had to shoulder nearly NT$200,000 (US$5,520) in government debts,
" Wang said, adding that the nation is in dire financial straits.</P>
      <P>With slower economic development, local investors have become more guarded,
unemployment remains high, and the gap between rich and poor has widened, he
said, adding that Taiwan is becoming an "M-shaped society."</P>
      <P>The jobless rate remains between 3 and 4 percent, and consumers are becoming
more cautious in their spending, an attitude that he said will impact on
domestic demand as people become poorer.</P>
      <P>The last factor is that the nation risks being marginalized in international
community, Wang said, noting that since 2000, politics has taken precedence in
public life.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration has promoted crafting a new constitution, renamed state-
own enterprises to drop "China" from their titles, removed statues of the late
President Chiang Kai-shek and other legacies of his rule, and promoted
referendums for U.N. membership under the name Taiwan, he stated.</P>
      <P>"These acts have more or less resulted in shrinking international support for
Taiwan," he said.</P>

      <P>Thanks to the concerted efforts of local and U.S. animal rights activists, 15
disabled stray dogs left Taiwan for the United States Wednesday aboard a China
Airlines (CAL) plane to find new homes and build new lives.</P>
      <P>"It marked the largest single shipment of stray dogs from Taiwan to the United

Taiwan (ARTT) volunteer who is in charge of the team's cross-border stray-dog
adoption affairs.</P>

      <P>According to Ni, the 15 dogs will first stay at shelters run by animal rights
groups in Los Angeles and Seattle, on arrival in the United States. After they
get accustomed to the new living environment, animal rights groups will arrange
for them to be adopted by pet-loving American families.</P>
      <P>The ARTT mobilized more than 50 volunteers to help prepare for the delivery and
China Airlines offered a 50 percent discount on the freight fares.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau announced Tuesday that police have busted a
car theft ring and arrested 17 suspects after storming 12 automotive service
shops and junkyards in central and southern Taiwan in the past few days.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the bureau said various police units joined the operation to
raid the crime syndicate's establishments in Taichung City, and in the counties
of Tainan, Yunlin and Chiayi. Police officers seized 11 stolen cars, 50 car
computers, two car engines and a range of automotive parts from stripped cars.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the car theft ring was led by a man identified as
Weng Hung-jung. The members of the ring would only steal expensive models valued
at over NT$3 million, such as Porche, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.</P>
      <P>The criminals would contact the owners of the stolen cars and ask them to pay
large sums of money to have their vehicles back. If the owners refused to
comply, the thieves would strip the cars, sell the usable parts and get rid of
the rest as scrap metal.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation showed that the car theft ring stole hundreds of
expensive cars in the past year and made an illegal profit of more than NT$10
million (US$330,085).</P>
      <P>The 17 suspects, some of whom are used car dealers and owners of auto parts
stores, will be referred to the Public Prosecutors Office in Tainan and charged
with theft.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Frank Hsieh suggested Wednesday that
the election of new party head be moved up one week to avoid a leadership vacuum
when his term expires on May 20.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, the defeated DPP candidate in the March 22 presidential poll, suggested
at a regular meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee that the DPP
chairmanship election be held on May 18 instead of May 25 as previously
scheduled.</P>
      <P>He said that this will allow for a "seamless transition" and will avoid a
situation of the party being without a leader in the period between May 20 and
May 25.</P>
      <P>Hsieh reiterated that he will not stand for election, and he advised other party
officials, including DPP Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan, not to compete for the
post.</P>
      <P>"If incumbent party officials want to run, they should quit their posts
immediately," Hsieh said, noting that "these same officials are the ones who
have to deal with election matters and it would therefore be hard for them to
remain strictly impartial."</P>
      <P>"It is not my duty to persuade or dissuade anyone from running for the
position," Hsieh said, noting that he is now a "caretaker" chairman.</P>
      <P>He made the comment in response to a suggestion  by DPP</P>
      <P>legislative caucus whip Ker Chien-ming that the party should</P>
      <P>nominate a candidate through consultations.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also suggested that more people be allowed to vote in the chairmanship
election, saying that members aged 18-35 should be allowed to take part in the
poll even if they have not been in the party for a year. The DPP charter
stipulates that members are eligible to vote only if they have been in the party
for at least one year. enditem/ pc</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman John Kuan denied Wednesday a media
report that his upcoming visit to China is aimed at exploring the bottom line of
Beijing's Taiwan policy when the KMT returns to power in May.</P>
      <P>"The report carried in the latest issue of Next weekly magazine was not true and
has caused me some confusion," Kuan said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>Kuan said he is indeed scheduled to head an academic delegation to visit
Shanghai in mid-April for scholastic exchanges, but he stressed  that  he has
not been  authorized  by the  party's president-elect Ma Ying-jeou to contact
any Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>"I have received no authorization from Ma to hold talks with China on any issues
on his behalf," Kuan said in the press statement, adding that his China visit
has nothing to do with Ma.</P>
      <P>Noting that he serves as president of an academic association dedicated to U.S.
study which has maintained regular exchanges with Fadan University in Shanghai,
Kuan said his upcoming visit is simply for the purpose of sharing views and
ideas on academic topics. He also denied the Next magazine report that he will
receive an honorary doctoral degree from Fudan University during his visit.</P>
      <P>Ma scored a decisive victory in his race with Frank Hsieh of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party in the March 22 presidential poll, paving the way
for the KMT to return to power after having been in opposition for eight years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't ready for partial opening of yuan conversion: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 2 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has completed preparations for a partial opening of cross-strait
currency conversion, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chen Ming-tong said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The nation's top China policy maker said a currency clearing and settlement
mechanism agreement will have to be signed between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait before Taiwan can fully open up the exchange of yuan, the Chinese
currency.</P>
      <P>Given the political factors involved, "it will be difficult, although the
government has made preparations," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came after President-elect Ma Ying-jeou pledged in an interview
with Reuters earlier in the day to push for direct cross-strait charter flights
on weekends and to open up Taiwan to Chinese tourists as soon as possible after
he takes office on May 20.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists, Ma said, he would
promote a full conversion between the yuan and New Taiwan dollar before the end
of this year.</P>
      <P>When asked if Taiwan  can unilaterally  open for currency conversion before
Taipei and Beijing sign a currency clearance and settlement mechanism agreement,
Chen said currently overseas business units (OBUs) or distribution business
units (DBUs) of foreign currency designated banks can accept yuan, but as the
yuan is not a strong currency internationally, there is no reason to ask
financial institutions to take possible currency exchange risks.</P>
      <P>More importantly, Chen said, a full opening of yuan conversion in Taiwan will
mean the exchange of huge sums of money, therefore "a currency clearance and
settlement mechanism is essential."</P>
      <P>But he said preparations for partial opening have been completed. If China is
ready to allow its nationals to come to Taiwan for tourism, the government will
have only to amend a cross-strait law, the Statute Governing the Relations
Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, to start the
currency exchange in Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Taiwan opened for yuan conversion in the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu on
a trial basis in October 2005.</P>
      <P>Chen estimated that if Taiwan allowed up to 1,000 Chinese tourists per day and
each of them converted up to 20,000 yuans, that would be "within the range of
control."</P>
      <P>In the future, there will be yuan conversion counters at the airports,
international hotels, major scenic spots and foreign currency exchange
designated banks, he said.</P>

      <P>Thanks to the concerted efforts of local and U.S. animal rights activists, 15
disabled stray dogs left Taiwan for the United States Wednesday aboard a China
Airlines (CAL) plane to find new homes and build new lives.</P>
      <P>"It marked the largest single shipment of stray dogs from Taiwan to the United
states for adoption in recent memory," said Ni Ching-tai, an Animal Rescue Team
Taiwan (ARTT) volunteer who is in charge of the team's cross-border stray-dog
adoption affairs.</P>
      <P>All of the dogs were physically disabled strays that were rescued by ARTT
volunteers from around the country, Ni said, adding that each of them had a
miserable past and needed good care.</P>
      <P>According to Ni, the 15 dogs will first stay at shelters run by animal rights
groups in Los Angeles and Seattle, on arrival in the United States. After they
get accustomed to the new living environment, animal rights groups will arrange
for them to be adopted by pet-loving American families.</P>
      <P>The ARTT mobilized more than 50 volunteers to help prepare for the delivery and
China Airlines offered a 50 percent discount on the freight fares.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, Ni said, the ARTT and its American counterparts have
jointly arranged for 600-plus stray dogs rescued from around Taiwan to find new
homes on the U.S. West Coast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Scrapping Chiang-related holidays step to end personality cult: Chen</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
04/03/08  13:18:01
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday his administration's decision last year
to abolish official observation of the birth and death of the late President
Chiang Kai-shek was a step toward ending the personality cult that was prevalent
during the authoritarian period of Taiwan's past.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement in an article published in the latest issue of his
online  newsletter,  in which  he commented  on Tomb-Sweeping Day, which falls
on April 4 this year and for the first time in more than 30 years has been
separated from the commemoration of Chiang's death on April 5, 1975.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Tomb-Sweeping Day, which is one the 24 seasonal spells in
the lunar year, is actually marked on the 105th day after the winter solstice on
the lunar calendar and may therefore fall on April 4, April 5 or April 6 on the
regular calendar.</P>
      <P>However, Chen noted, in the 32 years since Chiang's death, Tomb-Sweeping Day in
Taiwan has been observed on April 5 so as to coincide with the commemoration of
Chiang's passing, a situation which the president said had "misled the public
into thinking that the two events were concurrent."</P>
      <P>"The practice of combining the authoritarian personality cult with a cultural
holiday was not only diametric to our goal of ending single-party state and
authoritarianism, but also triggered many controversies," Chen said.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the Ministry of the Interior last year abolished the official
commemoration of Chiang's birth on Oct. 31 and his death on April 5, the
president stated. The decision helped to restore Tomb-Sweeping Day as a purely
civic festival during which the people remember their ancestors and family
members who have passed on, he added.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) warned the general public Thursday to
beware of a man who is claiming to be "a consul of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo based in Taipei," stressing that Taiwan does not have diplomatic
relations with the African country.</P>
      <P>Liu Bang-zyh, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of African Affairs
said at a regular press briefing that the ministry had received several calls
asking whether there was a Congolese embassy or consulate in Taiwan, as a man in
Taipei had been professing to be a diplomat of the Western African country.</P>
      <P>However, to date, there have been no reports of attempts by the man to defraud
or swindle anyone.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo do not have diplomatic
relations,  nor  is there  any official  reciprocal representation, such as
consulates, in either of the two countries," Liu noted.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the Congolese government never sought the Taiwan government's
approval to appoint anyone as an honorary consul in Taiwan, therefore the public
should beware of an imposter.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has 23 diplomatic allies, four of which are on the African
continent. They are Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe,
Kingdom of Swaziland and Republic of The Gambia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP raps president-elect for rejecting 'Taiwan'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers lambasted
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou Thursday over his reservations regarding the
"Taiwan" mark on local postage stamps, and accused Ma of discarding the name
"Taiwan" like "toilet paper" after using it to win the March 22 election.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers were referring to a request by Ma of the Kuomintang (KMT) that the
state postal company postpone the issuance of stamps to commemorate his May 20
inauguration on grounds that the "Taiwan" mark on the stamps is "controversial"
and that "Taiwan" is not the country's official name. The DPP legislators noted
that Ma had no such reservations when he used the slogan "Taiwan marches
forward" in his election campaign.</P>
      <P>The state-owned post office has been printing "Taiwan" in Chinese and English,
instead of the country's official name, "Republic of China, " on its postage
stamps since February 2007 when its name was changed from "Chunghwa Post Co." to
"Taiwan Post Co."</P>
      <P>The change was made as part of the DPP administration's efforts to revise the
names of state-owned enterprises that contained references  to China to avoid
confusion  with similarly named organizations in China. "Chunghwa" means
"Chinese" or "China" in the Chinese language.</P>
      <P>Expressing  regret and surprise  at Ma's decision  on the commemorative stamps,
the DPP lawmakers asked whether he would rename everything that included the
word "Taiwan" in its title, after his inauguration.</P>
      <P>"Does the word 'Taiwan' sound so unpleasant to the ears? How is it that Ma,
before the election, claimed he would do anything for Taiwan but is taking a
different stance now that the election is over?" asked DPP Legislator Chen Ting-
fei.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, a DPP legislative caucus whip, argued that the the DPP
administration's decision to rename "Chunghwa Post Co." was aimed at protecting
national interests, although the move was criticized by the KMT as catering to
the DPP's pro-Taiwan independence ideology.</P>
      <P>If the incoming KMT administration led by Ma were to restore the company's
original name to uphold the party's "great China" ideology, the KMT would be
making the very mistake it attributed to the DPP, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>"We urge the KMT to be consistent," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>During a recent interview with the media after his election, Ma argued that
Chunghwa Post Co.'s name change was "unlawful" because it had not been processed
though the required legal channels, a statement that gave rise to speculations
that the new government might restore the company's original name.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Thursday warned passengers bound for
South Africa to be extra vigilant regarding their personal safety as public
security in the African country has been deteriorating.</P>
      <P>There have been recent reports of several diplomats and tourists being tailed
and robbed upon arrival in South Africa, said Liu Bang-zyh, deputy director-
general of MOFA's Department of African Affairs.</P>
      <P>"Because the South African government still has not initiated any measures to
efficiently counter the escalation of crime,  the government of the United
States has also been considering issuing a travel advisory to its citizens," he
said.</P>
      <P>"Although a yellow-level travel advisory has not yet been issued for travelers
going to South Africa, Taiwanese visitors to the country should pay attention to
personal safety," he advised.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that the deterioration of public security in South Africa has resulted
in part from an influx of Zimbabwean refugees, millions of whom fled to the
country over the past three decades due to the disastrous economic situation in
their homeland.</P>
      <P>In addition, the economy of South Africa is also suffering, and along with the
global economic slowdown, has spurred an increase in the unemployment and crimes
rates, he said.</P>
      <P>He urged travelers to avoid South Africa unless absolutely necessary.</P>

      <P>The National Science Council (NSC) and representatives of the Australian
government have jointly announced the continuation of two scholarship programs
to encourage Taiwanese scholars, professionals and students to study in
Australia.</P>
      <P>The programs  are part of a bilateral  effort to enhance educational exchanges
and cooperation between the two countries, NSC Minister Chen Chien-jen said at
an announcement ceremony held at the NSC building Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Australian government has provided a total of NT$25.5 million (US$838,816)
to 22 Taiwanese students in the past two years, Chen said, noting that it was
the biggest sum compared to the scholarships offered by the other 36 countries
that have similar agreements with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Australian government will gradually increase the amount, which will be
doubled by 2011, he added.</P>
      <P>The application period for the scholarships this year is from April 9 to July
31.</P>
      <P>The NSC will also provide 10 openings in its annual scholarship program this
year for local doctoral students in the field of nanotechnology or biotechnology
research, with each student eligible to receive a maximum of NT$900,000, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Describing Australia as one of the top choices for Taiwanese students who wish
to study abroad, Chen said that in 2007 there were approximately 10,000
Taiwanese students enrolled in postgraduate programs there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Screening of CAL airplane deal 'legal': CAA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's largest air carrier, did not violate any
screening requirements in its recent airplane purchase deal, a top aviation
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The statement came one day after Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers questioned whether
CAL had signed a deal with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus to buy 20
A350-900 aircraft for over NT$130 billion (US$4.3 billion) before obtaining
official approval to do so.</P>
      <P>However,  Billy  Chang,  head  of  the  Civil  Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, said at a news
conference that the proposal had been properly processed.</P>
      <P>Chang explained that last December CAL submitted the procurement plan to the CAA
detailing the air carrier's intention to place an order for 14 of the 20 new
aircraft, to phase out the six A340-300 passenger jets it was operating, and to
maintain an option to buy an additional six new Airbus aircraft.</P>
      <P>The CAL plan also explained the method of payment, sources of funds and
financial forecast, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Before approving the plan, the CAA was also apprised of how CAL would maintain
the planes and whether the use of the new aircraft would be in line with Taiwan
Taoyuan  International  Airport regulations, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang said that on Jan. 21, a vice president of CAL told the CAA that the deal
was an emergency case, which prompted the CAA to step up the screening process
and to approve the plan the following day.</P>
      <P>Chang did not elaborate on the nature of the emergency. CAL signed the contract
with Airbus the same day it received approval from the CAA.</P>
      <P>In response to speculations that the deal had cost CAL an extra NT$10 billion
and an excessive 3 percent licensing fee, Chang said local airlines are not
required to include the price and the licensing fee in any aircraft procurement
proposals submitted to the CAA.</P>
      <P>Such amounts are regarded as commercial secrets and are therefore not subject to
CAA screening, Chang pointed out.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is up to airlines to decide on the type of planes they want to
buy, Chang said that the CAA screening focuses mainly on whether maintenance of
the aircraft is in line with existing rules.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The president of the electronics giant Sony Corporation promised during a
meeting with President-elect  Ma Ying-jeou Thursday to increase procurement in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ryoji Chubachi, president and electronics CEO of Sony Corp., said that Sony
plans not only to increase procurement and expand its investment in Taiwan, but
also to engage in research and development of advanced products with its
counterparts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chubachi, who is in Taipei to officiate at the opening of a promotion function
dubbed "Sony Fair, " related to the media that during his meeting with Ma he had
referred to the close cooperative links between electronic manufacturers in
Japan and Taiwan, and had expressed the hope that these ties would expand.</P>
      <P>Chubachi,  who holds a Ph. D. in Engineering from Tohoku University, was named
president of Sony Corp. and CEO of Sony's Global Electronics Business in June
2005. This is his second visit to Taiwan since then.</P>
      <P>Speaking to members of the local media, Chubachi said Sony Corp.'s revenues
usually shrink by 6 billion yen (US$58.377 million) whenever the Japanese
currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar by one yen.</P>
      <P>Chubachi said the global economic slowdown has already affected the world's
manufacturing sector. He quoted leading world economic forecast organizations as
predicting that economies in industrially advanced countries will grow about 3-4
percent for 2008, while rising economies like Brazil, Russia, India and China,
will record growth ranging from 6 to 9 percent for the year.</P>
      <P>He predicted that there will be no major impact on Sony Corp. should the U.S.
economy start to bottom out at the end of 2008. However, if the U.S. slowdown
continues, he said, the global economy will take a turn for the worse.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the news conference, vice president of Sony Corp. Naofumi Hara
said that in the face of the slowdown, Sony will increase incoming orders as a
short-term remedy, but its long-term strategy is to cut production overheads and
choose its production bases more carefully.</P>
      <P>Headquartered  in  Tokyo,  Sony  Corporation  is a leading manufacturer of
audio,  video,  communications  and information technology products for the
consumer and professional markets. Its music, motion pictures, computer
entertainment operations, and online businesses make Sony one of the most
comprehensive entertainment companies in the world.</P>
      <P>Sony recorded consolidated annual sales of approximately US$70.3 billion for the
fiscal year that ended March 31, 2007, and it employs 163,000 people worldwide.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) downplayed Thursday reports that
diplomatic relations with several of Taiwan's allies are fragile as the ministry
has not yet received official congratulatory telegrams from two of the country's
23 diplomatic allies following its recent presidential election, blaming the
silence on administrative delay.</P>
      <P>"Congratulatory messages of two allies are delayed due to administrational
procedures but shall be arriving in the next few days, " said MOFA's spokeswoman
Phoebe Yeh, without elaborating on the issue.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the two countries are Burkina Faso in western Africa and the
Caribbean country Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. However, the ministry
refused to confirm this.</P>
      <P>Yeh said "sending congratulatory telegrams is a good gesture which has no direct
link to diplomatic relations, " stressing that relations between Taiwan and its
diplomatic allies remain stable.</P>
      <P>She specifically dismissed reports that diplomatic ties with Saint Kitts and
Nevis are shaky, describing bilateral relations as "friendly and normal."</P>
      <P>Prime Minister Denzil Douglas of the Caribbean country paid a visit to Taiwan in
February to attend the opening ceremony of its first embassy in Asia, and
bilateral cooperative projects are under steady progress, which all indicate
that diplomatic links between the two countries remain unchanged, the diplomat
said.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's Vice President Annette Lu said in an interview with the Apple
Daily Wednesday that the delay was a "diplomatic warning" for the incoming
government as several allies have not yet sent out official congratulatory
telegrams.</P>
      <P>Lu explained Thursday that she made the remarks out of "good intention" to
caution President-elect Ma Ying-jeou and his incoming administration.</P>
      <P>The embassies of the two countries in question, on the other hand, declined to
make any comment Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ma's decisive victory on March 22 was so welcomed by the international community
that many countries, even without diplomatic relations with Taiwan,
congratulated Ma because many expected and welcomed the prospect of improvement
in cross-Taiwan Strait relations between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush also sent a statement right after the election to
congratulate Ma, praising Taiwan as a beacon of democracy in Asia, a contrast
from the letter sent by his secretary to President Chen Shui-bian, a week after
his election in 2004.</P>
      <P>However, Yeh noted that the ministry is paying close attention to China for any
maneuver to sway Taiwan's allies before the new government takes office on May
20.</P>
      <P>China has been trying to shrink Taiwan's international space by using financial
and political clout to lure Taiwan's diplomatic allies to switch their
allegiance to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry  warned there would be no diplomatic honeymoon for the new
government as there were signs that China was not easing its campaign to
suppress Taiwan's diplomatic ties with other countries.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Central Executive Committee will
decide next Monday whether it would move up the date of the party's chairmanship
election and whether the poll should be held alongside two other DPP elections,
party sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh suggested Wednesday that the election of the new party
head be moved up one week to avoid a leadership vacuum when his term expires on
May 20, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who stayed on at the post after he was defeated by Ma Ying-jeou of the
opposition Kuomintang in the March 22 presidential election, suggested that the
DPP chairmanship election be held on May 18 instead of May 25 as previously
scheduled.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that this will allow for a "seamless transition" and will avoid a
situation of the party being without a leader in the period between May 20 and
May 25.</P>
      <P>Under the DPP charter, the party chairman, delegates and local chapter chiefs
may serve two-year terms and elections are due on the fourth Sunday of May, or
May 25 this year.</P>
      <P>Party sources said that given the party's dire financial situation, it will face
difficulties if it does not combine the elections. The three-in-one election
will save money and help boost turnout rates, they said.</P>

      <P>High-tech companies in Taiwan and Japan could forge strategic alliances to
jointly tap the Chinese market, President-elect Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese  and Japanese  companies  have  maintained  close cooperation over
recent decades and such strategic alliances could further bilateral cooperation
in the field, Ma said after a 30-minute meeting with Ryoji Chubachi, president
of Sony Corp.</P>
      <P>Chubachi, head of the world's second-largest maker of consumer electronics, is
the first foreign business executive of a leading global company to visit Ma
after his election victory on March 22.</P>
      <P>Ma said the meeting focused on Sony's future procurement in Taiwan. Sony is the
third largest foreign buyer of Taiwan's high-tech products after Hewlett-Packard
Co. and Dell Inc., with the annual procurement amount reaching US$10 billion,
said Ma.  Chubachi said that Sony has plans to increase its procurement in
Taiwan, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Ma said he told Chubachi that he hoped Sony could also
increase investment in its research and development in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition,  Ma said that they discussed investment  and procurement on thin
film transistor (TFT) panels, something of which Taiwan is a leading maker.</P>
      <P>Ma added that Chubachi assured him Sony's cooperation with South Korean
companies or Sharp Corp. -- Japan's largest maker of liquid-crystal display
televisions -- will not affect its investment in Taiwan in this field.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chubachi also learned about Ma's promise to push for the
opening of direct air links between Taiwan and China soon after Ma assumes
office on May 20, information that could help Sony in deciding whether to expand
the size of its logistics center in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In another development, Ma said at a ceremony marking the 63rd anniversary of
Taipei Fuhsing Private School that he will "value morals over talent" in
appointing public agency heads in his administration.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday that she thinks the upward swing of rice
prices is more critical than gasoline price hikes.</P>
      <P>Lu said the country should pay closer attention to fluctuations in rice prices,
given that people could drive less when petroleum prices surge but cannot avoid
feeding themselves when the price of the important and popular staple, rice,
soars.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks during her speech at a ceremony held at National Chia Tung
Vocational School in the southernmost county of Pingtung to mark the school's
71st founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>The vice president encouraged students to devote their energy and time to
agricultural development after graduation, saying that agriculture is by no
means a low status industry.</P>
      <P>Rather, she said, agriculture is a strategic industry during war time and an
important driving force of a nation's economy during peace time.</P>
      <P>The vice president made a whirlwind trip to Pingtung County Thursday. In
addition to visiting the vocational school, Lu also toured the famous Known-You
Seed Co. and an aluminum processing company as well as a nursing home.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is very willing to help President-elect
Ma Ying-jeou arrange a visit to the United States prior to his May 20
inauguration if Ma's office raises such a request, Minister of Foreign Affairs
James Huang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the comments during a legislative committee meeting while fielding
questions from Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator John Chiang, who questioned whether
MOFA was sitting idle and not helping Ma.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside Chiang's concern on the grounds that MOFA has not received any
such request from Ma's office, Huang stressed that his ministry would definitely
do its best to help the president-elect arrange a visit to the United States if
he needs assistance in this regard.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, communications channels between Ma's office and MOFA have
been set up after Ma's election victory on March 22 to prepare for and arrange
the May 20 presidential  inauguration ceremony, but Ma's team has not mentioned
his hopes for a U.S. visit.</P>
      <P>"MOFA is not in a position to make any move regarding the issue without
permission from Ma, " Huang said, adding that "it would be good if Ma could
realize a U. S. visit to boost two-way relations before his inauguration on May
20."</P>
      <P>The minister, however, said that he could not judge whether or not Ma could make
a visit to the United States, because the U.S. side has to weigh several
factors.</P>
      <P>During a meeting last week with visiting American Institute in Taiwan Chairman
Raymond Burghardt, Huang said that they did not touch on Ma's plan to visit the
United States.</P>
      <P>Ma's aides said Wednesday that the president-elect's office is still negotiating
with the U.S. side over his U.S. visit request.</P>
      <P>Ma, of the main opposition KMT, beat his ruling Democratic Progressive Party
rival, Frank Hiseh, in the presidential race by a wide margin of more than 2.21
million votes, taking a record high of 7.65 million votes.</P>

      <P>A legislature monitoring group called the public's attention Thursday to the
poor attendance at the new legislature, noting that even the best-performing
lawmakers were absent from 50 percent of the meetings held over the past two
months.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by Citizen Congress Watch (CCW) based on the
attendances at 34 floor or committee meetings held between Feb. 1 and March 26,
the legislators with the lowest attendance rate were absent from 27 meetings,
while those with the highest attendance rate were absent from 17.</P>
      <P>The survey revealed that the lowest attendance were recorded for opposition
Kuomintang Legislators Liu Chuan-chung and Yang Jen-fu, both of whom were absent
from 27 meetings.</P>
      <P>Coming in second were KMT Legislator Fu Kun-chi and Non-Partisan Solidarity
Union (NPSU) Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei, who were both absent from 24 meetings.</P>
      <P>The third-lowest attendance were jointly recorded by seven legislators who were
absent from 22 meetings: Chen Chieh, Hsu Yao-chang, Tsao Erh-chung and Chung
Shao-ho of the KMT; Yen Chin-piao and Lin Pin-kun of the NPSU; and Ker Chien-
ming of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Lin Feng-cheng, a leading member of the legislative watchdog CCW, pointed out
that with each legislator receiving NT$184,960 in salary per month, the
legislators mentioned above each wasted between NT$160,000 and NT$130,000 in
taxpayers' money during the period.</P>
      <P>The legislators with the highest attendance -- attending 17 of the 34 meetings
-- were Liu Shen-liang, Lin Yu-fang, Shuai Hua-ming, John Chiang, Chang Hsien-

      <P>Children living in orphanages and shelters in Taiwan are generally in good
material condition but have an urgent need of professional psychological
counseling to increase their sense of security, social workers and orphanage
directors said Thursday, citing the results of a recent survey.</P>
      <P>In order to understand the daily lives and needs of these disadvantaged
children,  the Chinese Childrenhome  and Shelter Association (CCSA) conducted
the survey in February and March, based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, among
children aged between 10 and 15 in children's shelters nationwide.</P>
      <P>They survey results show that more than half of the children questioned are
satisfied with their physiological needs such as food, clothes and living
environment.</P>
      <P>However, in the area of psychological safety, about 50 percent described
themselves as victims of verbal or physical violence, said they sometimes feel
crowded out by other children and do not know how to turn to social workers or
shelter staff for help.</P>
      <P>"The need for psychological counselors in children's shelters is urgent, " said
Wu Xiao-ping, the CCSA's office manager, adding that only five shelters  out of
the country's  44 have  full-time psychological counselors.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the CCSA raised funds to hire part-time counselors who serve four hours
a week in 11 shelters and this year, they plan to hire more professionals who
will work in another 4.</P>
      <P>"But this leaves half of the children's homes still in need, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>As to the need for love and a sense of belonging, about 40 percent of the
children surveyed said they consider the staff and social workers as their
families but still have a strong desire to be reunited with their real parents,
the CCSA said, urging the parents to stay in close contact with their children.</P>
      <P>In the field of self-actualization, the CCSA expects children's shelters to
provide more opportunities to help them manage their finances and plan their
futures, by encouraging them to express themselves and participate in group
activities.</P>
      <P>The sheltered children include not only orphans (representing only 5 percent of
all sheltered children) as most people believe, but also children who have been
abandoned, maltreated by their parents or sexually abused (38 percent), or who
come from single-parent families unable to care for them (33 percent), the CCSA
noted.</P>
      <P>Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a psychological theory according to which five
levels of basic human needs -- physiological needs, safety,  love  and  a sense
of  belonging,  self-esteem  and self-actualization -- are ranked.</P>

      <P>The captain  and four crew of a Keelung-registered fishing boat that sank in
waters off Hong Kong last month returned to Taiwan Thursday,  the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) announced later that day.</P>
      <P>SEF officials said the vessel, the Man Chin Shun No. 6, sank March 31 about 45
nautical miles east of Hong Kong after being hit by another ship.</P>
      <P>The captain, Chang Cheng-shan, and crewmen Lin chin-li, Lee Ah-chou, Cheng Wan-

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Coalition Against Violence announced Thursday that it has set up a
hotline to help victims of domestic violence obtain timely assistance.</P>
      <P>Kao Feng-hsien, chairwoman of the coalition, told reporters that last year more
than 70,000 domestic violence cases were reported in Taiwan, but law enforcement
agencies investigated only half of them.</P>
      <P>There were also 7,000 sexual violence cases reported in 2007, but less than 20
percent of the cases were investigated, she said.</P>
      <P>The figures show that many victims of domestic and sexual violence did not get
appropriate assistance, Kao said.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, although Taiwan passed the Sexual Assault Crime Prevention Act
in 1997, followed by the implementation of the Domestic Violence Prevention Act
in 1998 and the Sexual Harassment Prevention Act in 2006, there is insufficient
coordination among different parts of government or society that can help
victims -- including law enforcement agencies,  hospitals,  the judiciary,
educational and social welfare institutions.</P>
      <P>Doctors and nurses, for example, often fail to report injuries from victims to
the police. Social welfare groups, wanting to protect the privacy of victims,
also are sometimes reluctant to notify the police when victims come to them for
help. Even when police officers investigate cases they know about, they often do
not arrest the perpetrators, thus many cases are not prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Kao said that with the new toll-free hotline (0800-434-434, ) her coalition will
"act like the government's eyes and arms" to help domestic violence victims find
protection against their abusers.</P>
      <P>In addition to setting up the hotline, Kao said, her coalition has formed an
advisory committee to supervise the government's domestic violence prevention
network and help refer domestic violence cases and appeals for help from victims
to related government agencies or private organizations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew, former Premier Hau Pei-tsun, retired
government officials and soldiers, as well as friends and family of the late
president Chiang Kai-shek on Thursday showed their profound respect and
appreciation of Chiang by commemorating the 33rd anniversary of his death.</P>
      <P>Chiang died at the age of 87 from kidney failure and advanced cardiac
malfunction in Taipei on April 5, 1975, 26 years after he withdrew from mainland
China to Taiwan, after losing a civil war with the Communists.</P>
      <P>Expressing respect for Chiang's achievement in fighting against the Japanese
invasion and occupation of China during World War II and reclaiming Taiwan from
Japanese control, Tsai Kong Ming-ru, executive director of the National Women's
League of the Republic of China (NWL), which organized the event, said "he
(Chiang) is a good example for us to learn from."</P>
      <P>Tsai said that Chiang and his wife Soong May-ling, also known as Madame Chiang,
were devoted to the implementation of the "New Life Movement," a campaign to
educate people with the right attitude toward life.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully the spirit of the New Life Movement can last and bring our nation a
bright future," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Discounting recent actions by the current administration of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party to downplay the legacy of Chiang, Reverend Chou
Lian-hua, the Chiangs' family-priest, said "we, the younger generation, cannot
deny the contributions of our forefather (Chiang) to the country."</P>
      <P>Naming Chiang as "the grandfather of everyone," Chou said that "Chiang's efforts
indeed helped Taiwan to be stabilized socially and economically after the war."</P>
      <P>In defense of criticism over Chiang's dictatorship, Chou said "his (Chiang's)
personality as well as moral quality is what people have to take as an example
which is undeniable."</P>
      <P>From 1928 until his death, Chiang served as Generalissimo of the national
government of the Republic of China (ROC). In 1925, he took control of the
Kuomintang (KMT) after the death of Sun Yat-sen and led the KMT until his death
in 1975.</P>
      <P>Critics, including current President Chen Shui-bian have blamed Chiang for the
228 Incident in Taiwan in 1947 and the subsequent period of "White Terror" in
which thousands of people were killed or arrested for opposing or for suspicions
of being opposed to the KMT's authoritarian rule.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's stock brokers could begin trading in the Abu Dhabi Securities Market
(ADSM) in June and capitalize on the new market, Wu Rong-I, chairman of the
Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSEC), said Thursday following a roundtable discussion
with the ADSM's CEO, Tom Healy and other ADSM officials.</P>
      <P>The TSEC, which signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the ADSM last
December, discussed with the Mideast partner the future of the global stock
market and the details of bilateral cooperation in areas such as reciprocal
stock market listings of Exchange Traded Funds (ETF).</P>
      <P>Local brokers, securities investment trust enterprises and financial officials
also joined the roundtable talks held at Taipei 101.</P>
      <P>"Following  the signing  of the MOU that regulates  stock investment, Taiwan's
public companies will be able to capitalize on the new Abu Dhabi market in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE)," said Wu, adding that the oil-rich Islamic country
has shown interest in Taiwan's world-leading electronic sectors.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that under the MOU framework, the three key areas of cooperation  are
bilateral investment,  strategic alliances  -- including information sharing --
and the development of financial products.</P>
      <P>Wu said that in order to accommodate the MOU, the UAE is working on legislation
to allow foreign stock trading of ETFs, and that the process is expected to be
completed by June.</P>
      <P>Taiwan brokers are also ready to enter the new market, he indicated.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's Polaris Securities has shown interest in trading in Abu Dhabi with
stocks that would not violate Islamic taboos such as the ban on pork trading,"
Wu said.</P>
      <P>Touching on global trends in stock exchange alliances, Wu said some of the
world's largest stock exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) , are
seeking partners in the Asian stock market, with Taiwan among the top choices.</P>
      <P>The TSEC is also scheduled to sign an MOU with Poland's Warsaw Stock Exchange
(WSE) on April 7.</P>
      <P>"Eastern Europe is a virgin market waiting to be explored by Taiwan brokers and
investors," Wu said, referring to it as an "emerging market" in what was known
as the Iron Curtain region in the post-World War II period.</P>
      <P>He added that the WSE had already indicated its willingness to deal with some
Taiwanese companies that have established scores of businesses in Poland's
market, and that further discussions will be held at the MOU signing.</P>
      <P>An ETF is an investment vehicle traded on primary exchanges, similar to major
stocks or bonds but with the advantages of low exchange costs and a more diverse
stock portfolio that could minimize investment risks. ETFs provide an easier
access for foreign investors to evaluate the local stocks, facilitating the
foregin capital to flow into local bourse and companies.</P>
      <P>Michael Lin, TSEC's senior executive vice president, said that according to a
report by the management consulting firm McKinsey's, global investors see stocks
in Taiwan and Singapore as hot cakes in the Asian market.</P>
      <P>"Many foreign stock exchanges are attracted by the diversity of the industry
sector listings on Taiwan's stock market," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's stock market is a fully-developed market, " he said, drawing a
comparison with the Abu Dhabi exchange which lists mostly real estate and
financial stocks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT raises question of Ma serving as party chairman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The question of whether President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang (KMT)
should serve concurrently as the chairman of his party is one that can be put up
for discussion, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The secretary-general's remarks came one day after KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung
raised the issue in a KMT Central Standing Committee meeting. The chairman said
Wednesday that the possibility of amending the party's charter prior to the next
chairmanship election in August 2009 to allow for the president to serve
concurrently as party head can be further contemplated.</P>
      <P>Wu Den-yih, on the sidelines of a memorial service to mark the 33rd anniversary
of the death of President Chiang Kai-shek, said Thursday that the KMT chairman
had discussed the matter with him previously.</P>
      <P>Noting that a party's charter "has to progress with time," and that the KMT had
recently added "Taiwan-centric advocacy" to its charter, Wu Den-yih said "this
issue can indeed be put up for discussion without a pre-determined stance."</P>
      <P>The current KMT charter stipulates that the chairman of the party should be
chosen by its members by means of direct election, Wu noted. However when the
popularly elected president is from the KMT, the question arises of whether the
party should be headed by a national leader who has a broader support base, Wu
Den-yih added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, noting that Wu Poh-hsiung had led
the party to victory in the Jan. 12 legislative election and the March 22
presidential election, said that if the incumbent chairman decides to serve
another term after August 2009, he is sure to "lead the KMT to another win in
the city and county chief elections late that year."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the question of whether the president should also hold the party
chairmanship, Wang said that "this will largely depend on Ma's wishes."</P>
      <P>There are advantages and disadvantages to such an arrangement, he added.</P>
      <P>The advantages are that the president will find it easier to promote his
policies or ideals via the party as the KMT has a firm grip on both the
executive and legislative branches of government, he said. However, one of he
disadvantages will be a retrogression to the government being led by the party,
he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) officials expressed warm welcome Thursday at
Sony's commitment to expand its investment and procurement in Taiwan, and said
the ministry will offer its assistance to facilitate Sony's plans.</P>
      <P>Ryoji Chubachi, president of Japanese electronics giant Sony Corp., promised
during a meeting with President-elect Ma Ying- jeou that same day to increase
procurement and expand investment in Taiwan, casting a vote of confidence in the
new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>He also committed Sony to engaging in research and development of advanced
products with Taiwanese companies.</P>
      <P>"The ministry has been making efforts to attract more foreign investors,
especially from Japan, whose manufacturing is among the world's top, " said
Berton B.C. Chiu, director-general of the Department of Investment Services
under the MOEA.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the department will do everything possible to assist Sony in its
investment and procurement plans, including help with land acquisition and
customs regulations.</P>
      <P>"In addition to investment in local manufacturers,  Sony's procurement of local
electronic parts could also help Taiwan's export business, " he added, citing
Sony as an important partner in the development of Taiwan's electronic sector.</P>
      <P>Touching on the outlook for foreign investment, Chiu said the most likely
industry sectors to set up in Taiwan in the future are wireless broadband,
digital life, healthcare and green industries, "because the MOEA has been
improving manufacturing in those areas."</P>
      <P>Sony has already been working with the MOEA on scores of projects involving
local industries.</P>
      <P>"Sony has transferred technology to Taiwanese electronics makers to help develop
products such as game software for PlayStation 3, Sony's 2006 hit in the gaming
market," said Leu Jang-Hwa, director of the Information Technology Industries
Division of the Industrial Development Bureau under the MOEA.</P>
      <P>Leu also referred to another Sony-assisted project -- Taiwan Green Environmental
Partner (TGEP) -- which pushed local electronic component makers to reach the
Sony Green Partner Standard (GP) a high-quality eco-friendly identification
among global makers.</P>
      <P>"Once a company is qualified to GP standards, it can obtain business orders from
Sony to expand its clients around the world, " Leu said.</P>
      <P>The increasing amount of procurement in Taiwan from Sony -- US$6.5 billion
(NT$195 billion) last year -- Leu noted, shows the company's ambition to further
base its business in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Following a logistics center Sony launched in Taichung in 2007, the company is
planning to open another one in southern Taiwan, " he added.</P>
      <P>Sony recorded consolidated annual sales of approximately US$70.3 billion for the
fiscal year that ended March 31, 2007. The company employs 163,000 people
worldwide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA urges public to turn out lights for one hour on Earth Day</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) urged the public
Thursday to make an effort to observe Earth Day on April 22, to help reduce
carbon emission.</P>
      <P>Wearing a necktie of tissue made from recycled plastic bottles, Winston Dang
called for people to turn off their lights and elevators for one hour on Earth
Day to show Taiwan's ambition to participate in the international event.</P>
      <P>For every person who does so, 0.25 kg of CO2 emission can be reduced, so that if
1 million people do so, the CO2 emission reduction would reach 250,000 kg, which
is the quantity of CO2 absorbed by more than 20,000 trees in one year, according
to Dang.</P>
      <P>"We hope to make the one-day activity more frequent in the future," he said.</P>
      <P>"It is necessary to begin the movement with public institutions, " he went on,
adding that the EPA has already begun to save natural resources by turning out
its lights for an hour each day, banning the use of paper cups and limiting the
use of elevators.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged people to buy food produced locally instead of imported
produce, to open the window rather than turn on the air conditioner,  to stop
using disposable tableware and to avoid purchasing goods with too much
packaging.</P>
      <P>Displaying a pedometer he was wearing, Dang also promoted walking and using
public transportation rather than driving private vehicles.</P>
      <P>The minister went on foot from the EPA building to the press conference, which
took place in an elementary school 500 meters away, while some EPA officials
went by car.</P>
      <P>Also that day, the EPA launched a Web site on Earth Day, providing information
and activities about the event, as well as suggestions on saving energy.</P>
      <P>"Although Taiwan is not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, we can still do our
best to reduce the effects of global warming, " said Dang, adding that Taiwan
"might be the first country to enact regulations concerning the reduction of
greenhouse gases."</P>
      <P>A draft of greenhouse gas reduction regulations, approved by the Cabinet in
2006, is still being revised by legislators.</P>
      <P>Earth Day was initiated in the United States in the 1970s, the period during
which the consumption of leaded fuel was at its peak, with the aim of enhancing
awareness of environmental protection. It became an international event in 1990
with the participation of 141 countries worldwide, including Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>20,000 light bulbs and tubes to light up remote schools</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 20,000 light bulbs and tubes will be sent to 100 elementary schools
in rural Taiwan, in a campaign to improve underprivileged students' study
environment, the campaign organizers announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The lights will change the lives of those underprivileged children," said
Gordon Yeh, chairman of Fubon Securities who is also a member of Fubon Charity
Foundation(Fubon), one of the event organizers.</P>
      <P>People living in cities or developed areas can not understand how basic
resources, such as light bulbs, can be so scarce in rural Taiwan, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>"I hope this campaign -- Light Up Hope, Sketching Future, Delivering Love --
will generate more love and concern from the public for the children," Yeh said
at the launching ceremony.</P>
      <P>Under the program, 20,000 light bulbs and tubes will be donated by Royal Philips
Electronics of the Netherlands, Taiwan (Philips Taiwan) and be delivered by
FedEx Corp. (FedEx) to 100 poor schools in remote areas of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The program is cosponsored by Fubon, Philips Taiwan, and FedEx.</P>
      <P>The bulbs and tubes are energy saving and are expected to help the schools
reduce their electricity usage by 10 percent, resulting in a savings of NT$
190,000 (US$ 12,459) on energy costs a year for 100 schools, Edward Po, general
manager of the Philips Taiwan's Lighting Division, said.</P>
      <P>Chin Bin-cheng, principal of Wan-fu Elementary School located in the northeast
county of Yilan said that a small school like hers needs to pay NT$160, 000 (US$
5,245) on electricity and water bills each year, but the local government only
allocates a budget of NT$ 80,000 (US$2,623) for those utilities.</P>
      <P>"This has forced us to turn off some lights in the classrooms, and the optical
health of the children are also hampered," Chin said.</P>
      <P>She added that the donations "indeed helps solve our budget shortfall problem to
pay electricity bills in many remote schools."</P>
      <P>Edward Po also expressed a willingness to continue helping the schools in the
future.</P>
      <P>"We hope to use our resources to promote sustainability and give back to
society," said Po.</P>
      <P>Michael Chu, managing director of FedEx, Taiwan, said: "the campaign allows us
to use our extensive logistic network and expertise to make a real difference in
the lives of thousands of underprivileged children."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fubon Holding approved to invest in Xiamen Bank</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government gave a green light to Taipei-based Fubon Financial Holding Co.
Thursday, allowing it to invest in a bank in Xiamen City, in China's
southeastern province of Fujian.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) granted approval to a
proposal submitted by Fubon Hong Kong to invest US$34 million to acquire a
reported 20 percent stake in Xiamen City Commercial Bank.</P>
      <P>The approval makes Fubon Financial Holding the first Taiwanese banking group to
obtain governmental permission to invest in a bank in China via an overseas
subsidiary.</P>
      <P>Susan Chang, an FSC vice chairwoman and spokeswoman, said Fubon Financial
Holding's total assets amounted to US$7.78 billion as of the end of 2007, with a
BIS (bank of international settlement ratio) of 14.42 percent.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chang said,  Fubon Financial Holding has not committed any major
irregularities in its business operations over the last three years.</P>
      <P>With the approval, Fubon Financial Holding can now apply to the Investment
Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs for formal permission to start
the investment plan.</P>
      <P>The investment plan is poised to increase Taiwanese banks' cooperation with
their Chinese counterparts and most importantly, it could serve as a platform
for Taiwanese banking institutions to improve their services to China-based
Taiwanese businessmen and companies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Gong Tien-hsing, president of Fubon Financial Holding, said the
company is expected to forge a contract with Xiamen City Commercial Bank in the
middle of the year if everything goes smoothly.</P>
      <P>However, Gong declined to say any more about the investment plan, pointing out
that it would be inappropriate for him to express an opinion before an agreement
is inked.</P>
      <P>Xiamen City Commercial Bank was established  in 1996 with investment by the
Xiamen local government, as well as by several private companies and
individuals.</P>
      <P>Now with 31 branches around the city, the bank touts itself as "the Xiamenese'
own bank." Its total assets totaled 15.05 billion yuan and net assets stood at
440 million yuan as of the end of 2006.</P>
      <P>Xiamen, the Chinese city located closest to Taiwan, has been designated as one
of the two Chinese coastal cities allowed to engage in the "mini three links"
with the Taiwan-held outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu since 2001.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves at US$286.86 billion</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves amounted to US$286.86 billion as of the end
of March, an increase of US$9.022 billion from the month-earlier level, the
Taiwan-based Central Bank of China (CBC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The figure represented the second-highest monthly increase after an increase of
US$9.877 billion in February 2004, CBC officials said.</P>
      <P>They attributed the dramatic increase to the appreciation of the euro and other
major currencies against the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange reserves denominated
in these currencies were thus worth more in terms of the base currency -- the
greenback -- they added.</P>
      <P>Net foreign capital inflow and returns from foreign exchange reserve management
also contributed to the increase, they continued.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  foreign exchange  reserves  remained  the world's fifth-largest after
those of China (US$1.52 trillion as of last December, the latest figure
available), Japan (US$979.2 billion as of February) , Russia (US$383.6 billion
as of February) and India (US$294.6 billion).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) is to begin clinical testing of a
target drug for head and neck cancers,  providing  17-week courses of free
treatment for 20 volunteers, hospital sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Cetuximab -- marketed under the brand name Erbitux -- is a target drug developed
by U.S.-based pharmaceutical company ImClone Systems and approved for use in
colon cancer by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2004.</P>
      <P>Lin Jin-ching, an oncologist at the hospital, explained that the reason for the
testing program is because the drug might also be helpful for treating patients
with head and neck cancer.</P>
      <P>TVGH physicians said that a 56-year-old male patient came to the hospital two
years ago and was diagnosed with tongue and neck cancer. The patient, who
underwent various therapies for a long period, finally settled on cetuximab and
was cured in only four months.</P>
      <P>However, they went on, a single dose of cetuximab costs NT$10,000 (approximately
US$329), while a full course of three months would cost up to NT$300,000 --
which put many patients who are in financial difficulties off the idea of the
testing.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we asked Merck KGaA for financial assistance to carry out the
project, " Lin said, adding that Merck KGaA, the global distributor of
cetuximab, decided to provide some NT$10 million for the program.</P>
      <P>According to the hospital, the project will begin as soon as 20 suitable
volunteers are recruited.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must engage in cash settlement talks with China before it gives a go-
ahead for allowing Chinese yuan exchange services on Taiwan proper,  the
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>FSC officials said that if the signing of a formal agreement on free currency
exchanges between the Chinese yuan and the new Taiwan dollar is not possible in
the near future, the government should at least seek to build a mechanism to
facilitate the cross-strait currency exchange business.</P>
      <P>The FSC will listen to advice from the Taiwan-based Central Bank of China (CBC)
for any moves in this regard, they said.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwanese citizens are only allowed to take up to 20,000 yuan in or
out of the country when they travel via the Taiwan-held outlying islands of
Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>However, in an exclusive interview with the British news agency Reuters the day
before, President-elect Ma Ying-jeou reportedly said he will see to it that
Chinese yuan-NT dollar exchanges will be opened at the end of this year at the
latest.</P>
      <P>FSC officials said the CBC could borrow from the experiences in conducting
exchanges between the NT dollar and other foreign currencies to work out a
pragmatic mechanism for regulating the opening, even in the absence of a formal
cross-strait cash settlement agreement.</P>
      <P>In March 2004, the central bank began to allow local citizens to bring in up to
6,000 yuan per homecoming visit and increased the limit to 20,000 yuan in
October 2005.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed reports have said that Taiwanese people might have amassed a total
of more than 100 billion Chinese yuan (US$14.25 billion) over the past several
years.</P>
      <P>The accumulation of Chinese currency in Taiwan can be attributed to a
combination of factors, including China's chronic trade deficit with Taiwan and
the inclination of Taiwanese businessmen operating in China to bring home
Chinese yuan.</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, local
people have made a total of more than 12 million visits to China over the past
three years.</P>

      <P>A drunken driver who killed two coeds of Toko University in Puzih City in the
southern county of Chiayi late Wednesday has been identified as the university's
director of general affairs, local police said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to police officers and public prosecutors investigating the incident,
Lin Chi-cheng, 35, admitted that he had dozed off at the wheel when the sport
utility vehicle he was driving hit the two female students, who were riding
bicycles.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-chen, 20, and Wu Hao-shu, 21, were pronounced dead after they were
rushed to a hospital.</P>
      <P>Police found Lin still in his immobilized car 300 meters from the scene of the
accident. The car had hit a wall and a tree, busting a tire before coming to a
halt.</P>
      <P>Officers who gave Lin a breathalyzer test found that his blood alcohol
concentration measured 0.99 percent, almost four times the maximum allowed limit
of 0.25 percent.</P>
      <P>At a meeting Thursday, the teachers' advisory committee of Toko University
decided to suspend Lin from his duties pending completion of the due process of
law.</P>
      <P>The university authorities said faculty members and students are not allowed to
consume alcohol on campus and that they will be expelled from the university if
they commit drunken driving offenses off campus.</P>
      <P>Toko University  President  Huang  Shao-yen  expressed  his condolences to the
families of the two students and presented NT$100,000 to each family as a token
gesture of solace.</P>
      <P>Lin also apologized to the two families and promised to shoulder all the
responsibility. He was released by the Chiayi District Public Prosecutors Office
on bail of NT$100,000.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin announced Thursday that he will travel to China to
sign an agreement on showcasing the city's achievements in wireless broadband
development and resource recycling at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo.</P>
      <P>"It is a major honor that Taipei will be able to show off its progress in these
two advanced  fields along with such world metropolises as Geneva, London, Paris
and Osaka at the Shanghai World Expo's `best practice' area," a jubilant Hau
told a news conference.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, it will mark the first time that Taiwan has been offered an
opportunity to operate a pavilion at a world exposition since the country was
forced out of the United Nations in 1971.</P>
      <P>Noting that the city government has received confirmation that its application
has been successful, Hau said he will travel to Shanghai to strike a final deal
on the event and inspect the exhibition site.</P>
      <P>"The itinerary will be worked out after we receive the event organizers' formal
invitation letter, " Hau said, adding that it was too early to give an exact
date for his visit.</P>
      <P>If his travel plans come to fruition, Hau will be the first mayor of Taiwan's
capital city ever to visit China.</P>
      <P>Hau said the city government will need to seek financial aid from the central
government and the private sector to realize its plan to showcase its wireless
broadband and resource recycling models at the Shanghai World Expo, which will
be held in an area between the Nanpu and Lupu bridges on both banks of the
Huangpu River in Shanghai from May 1-Oct. 31, 2010.</P>
      <P>The exposition  will be divided  into four main areas to accommodate national
pavilions, city pavilions, thematic pavilions and the "Best Practice" area.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taipei will be downgraded to a city under China and incorporated
into China's national pavilion, Hau said Taipei will only be showcased in the
"Best Practice" area. Even if China opens a Taiwan pavilion at the exhibition,
it will have nothing to do with the Taipei city government, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting  that  more  than  200 countries  and international organizations are
expected to take part in the Shanghai World Expo, Hau said he believes Taipei's
participation in the event will be conducive to its city-to-city diplomacy and
its international image and profile.</P>
      <P>Taipei has won worldwide recognition for its wireless Internet infrastructure,
including receiving the 2006 Intelligent Community Award conferred by the
Intelligent Community Forum, which is an affiliated organization of the World

"Best Practice" area. Even if China opens a Taiwan pavilion at the exhibition,
it will have nothing to do with the Taipei city government, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting  that  more  than  200 countries  and international organizations are
expected to take part in the Shanghai World Expo, Hau said he believes Taipei's
participation in the event will be conducive to its city-to-city diplomacy and
its international image and profile.</P>
      <P>Taipei has won worldwide recognition for its wireless Internet infrastructure,
including receiving the 2006 Intelligent Community Award conferred by the
Intelligent Community Forum, which is an affiliated organization of the World
Teleport Association.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A warehouse built with funds from Taiwan's government that will be used to store
disaster relief supplies opened Thursday in Pasay City in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan donated US$300,000 to the Philippines at the end of 2006 to purchase
supplies and help rebuild areas devastated by Typhoon Durian. The National
Resource Operations Center Warehouse was also built with the funds to leave the
Philippines in better position to cope with natural disasters in the future.</P>
      <P>The warehouse, featuring two temperature-controlled rooms for storing perishable
goods and a heat-insulating roof, is located near Manila International Airport
and was completed after two years of construction.</P>
      <P>Before the establishment of the new warehouse, all donations and goods were
stored in an old warehouse at the Department of Social Welfare and Development
(DSWD), department officials said.</P>
      <P>Space often ran out in the warehouse, and the department had to set up a
temporary enclosure nearby to store goods that were vulnerable to exposure to
the sun and rain.</P>
      <P>The DSWD plans to establish a second warehouse and peripheral facilities with
the remainder of the funds provided by Taiwan, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>To mark the inauguration of the 800-square-meter warehouse, Taiwan's
representative  to the Philippines  Wu Hsin-hsing and Philippine Social Welfare
and Development Secretary Esperanza I. Cabral presided over a ribbon-cutting
ceremony on Thursday.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, Wu said Taiwan, with its close geographical proximity to the
Philippines and its solid friendship with its southern neighbor,  has always
felt Filipino's  suffering when disasters hit and the donation of the warehouse
was an expression of that compassion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cabral expressed her country's gratitude for Taiwan's humanitarian
aid and expressed her hope that the governments of the two countries could push
forward further cooperative relations in every field between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Cabral later presented Wu with a plaque as a gesture of thanks to Taiwan's
government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislative Yuan to hold public hearing Monday on gasoline prices</HEADLINE>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislative committee will hold a public hearing Monday to debate a
controversial freeze on local gasoline prices that has temporarily reduced
inflationary pressures but led to huge losses at state-owned oil refiner CPC
Corp., Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Legislature's Economics and Energy Committee has invited representatives
from academia, the government and industry to offer their views on increasing
domestic fuel and electricity prices, resuming a price adjustment mechanism, and
providing subsidies for disadvantaged groups if gas prices are raised.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Wong Chung-chun urged the Executive Yuan
to keep politics out of its handling of the fuel price issue and focus instead
on economic considerations.</P>
      <P>The questions that needed to be addressed, Wong said, were whether or not gas
prices should be increased, and, if so, when and by how much.</P>
      <P>Wong said officials from CPC Corp., Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (FPCC) --
Taiwan's only private refinery, the state-owned Taiwan Power Company, and other
related government bodies such as the Council for Economic Planning and
Development and the Fair Trade Commission would attend the hearing.</P>
      <P>CPC, Taiwan's biggest oil refiner, said Tuesday it would maintain its freeze on
gasoline and diesel prices in April in line with government policy, after
Formosa Petrochemical hiked its prices at the pump by just under 10 percent in
late March.</P>
      <P>CPC has suffered substantial losses since the freeze was first imposed in
November and is expected to post a deficit of NT$30 billion (US$984.25 million)
in the first four months of 2008, said KMT Legislator Lu Shiow-yen.</P>
      <P>Warning of a possible loss of more than NT$100 billion from national coffers
from CPC deficits this year if the price cap is maintained, Lu urged the
Executive Yuan to resume its use of the floating oil price mechanism that set
gasoline prices based on international crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>CPC adopted a floating pricing mechanism in January 2007 under which it adjusted
its fuel prices on a weekly basis in response to crude oil price fluctuations.
The system was then replaced by a monthly adjustment mechanism last September.</P>

      <P>The convener of the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) ad hoc presidential handover

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reflected on his family history as well as his
presidency Friday at a ceremony in his home county of Tainan marking the
unveiling of the complete geneology of the Chen clan in the county's Hsichuang
Village.</P>
      <P>Prior to the ceremony, Chen visited the tomb of the first member of his clan to
arrive in Taiwan from China centuries ago to pay homage in a traditional
ceremony of ancestral and religious worship.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Chen said his ancestors came to Taiwan from Shaoan
County in the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian 300 years ago in search of
peace and stability. Although following generations of the clan always
remembered where they originally came from, they also knew that Taiwan was their
home country, he stressed.</P>
      <P>"They knew Taiwan was their country and that it was their duty and mission to
protect it," he said.</P>
      <P>During his eight years as president,  Chen said,  he has continuously striven to
uphold this principle by working to protect Taiwan's interests, and he willfully
accepted the responsibility of insisting on Taiwan-centric values and upholding
Taiwan's sovereignty in the face of external pressure.</P>
      <P>He added that history will judge him as a protector of Taiwan and that his
compatriots  will eventually  come to understand his motivations and principles
in this regard.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen's updated geneology records clarified a misperception that he
was of Hakka ancestry.</P>
      <P>"According to the Chen clan geneology, my ancestors came from Shaoan County's
Ciyao Village, which is a Hoklo community, not a Hakka community," he explained.</P>

      <P>Children in Taiwan will once again have a chance to step into a magic world of
fun and creativity, with the opening of the third Taiwan International
Children's TV and Film Festival (TICTFF), the event organizers said Friday in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Educating children through television and film has always been one of our
important services and we sincerely hope that audiences of all ages will enjoy
an entertaining and educational feast of creativity at this year's film
festival,said Cheng Tung-liao, chairman of the Public Television Service (PTS),
one of the organizers of the TICTFF.</P>
      <P>The event was ceremoniously opened by official guests, including Government
Information Office Minister Shieh Jhy-wey and PTS Chairman Cheng, who were
dressed as magicians and waved their "wands" to unveil the mascot, in keeping
with TICTFF's "Magic Garden" theme this year.</P>
      <P>Eight-year-old Chiou Hsien-song, who has been playing the guitar for just one
year, gave a solo performance that won the hearts of the audience.</P>
      <P>Shieh, in his opening speech, explained to the overseas guests the significance
of the Chinese characterwhich stands for "children."</P>
      <P>He said the character is constructed of two parts -- a big head and two small
feet -- which he said is similar to the appearance of an infant. The top part of
the character signifies that a child's head is open to the world and that
everything is possible, he added.</P>
      <P>Shieh also pointed to the unlimited scope of the imagination as one of
humanity's greatest assets.</P>
      <P>"The biggest nation in the world is not the United States, nor is it China or
India, but rather the imagination, which is the children's and our domain,"
Shieh said, drawing laughter and a big round of applause.</P>
      <P>The third TICTFF, launched on April 4 Childrens Day in Taiwan, is organized by
the PTS and Fubon Cultural &amp; Educational Foundation, under the supervision
of the Government Information Office. It brings film and TV productions, with
their colorful dreams and lifestyles, from all over the world to children in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>We believe that the Taiwan International Children's TV and Film Festival
provides a new way for audiences to see the world," said Robert Chen, one of the
film festival jurors. "It also encourages us to open our hearts and to
experience the world."</P>
      <P>Nicole Elena Dreiske, founder and artistic director of the Chicago International
Children's Film Festival said that what is most valuable about the festival is
that it induces children to think about what they watch.</P>
      <P>"Media education is one of the most important common issues in global
culture,she said, adding that children will become "passive consumers and
uninformed voters" if they do not digest, discuss and and reflect on what they
are watching.</P>
      <P>Irene Chen, president of the Fubon Cultural &amp; Educational Foundation, said
that as a mother of four children, aged 13 to 19, she found the TICTFF very
educational.</P>
      <P>"Through the festival's marvelous efforts, its productions and films, our
children have a chance to grasp and embrace the true notion of a global village,
to become better, more broad-minded people with an appreciation for different
cultures,she said.</P>
      <P>This years TICTFF features four exhibitions and ten workshops at Eslite
Bookstores on Xinyi and Dunhua South roads, Taipei City. The biennial will also
screen 105 films from 31 countries, until it closes on April 8.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Mysterious side of Cihhu soon to be opened to public</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 4 (CNA)
04/04/08  19:55:34</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The temporary burial place of Taiwan's late President Chiang Kai-shek in Taoyuan
County, once a prime tourist attraction,  lost some of its luster  in recent
decades  as democratization gripped Taiwan and the authoritarian figure fell out
of favor.</P>
      <P>But interest in the Cihhu Presidential Burial Place was actually revived in the
past two years as it became embroiled in the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) campaign to remove public vestiges of the man many see as a
brutal dictator.</P>
      <P>Chiang statues from around Taiwan were relocated to the hillside park near the
mausoleum, and the DPP then further raised the site's profile when it closed
down access to Chiang's marble sarcophagus late last December by pulling funding
for the military detail guarding the grounds.</P>
      <P>With the election of Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Ma Ying-jeou in the March 22
presidential election, Taoyuan County officials hope the mausoleum will be
reopened and plan to give the public a glimpse of a previously restricted
section of the park.</P>
      <P>The forbidden area, which sits to the rear of Chiang's temporary burial place,
has been closely guarded by the military since the late president built a
residence on the grounds in 1962.</P>
      <P>Cihhu, also spelled Cihu or Tzuhu, refers to the lake located near the tomb
site. Originally called "Horn South Pond" because of its shape, " the lake was
renamed by Chiang in memory of his mother because the scenery in the area
reminded him of his hometown of Sikou in Zhejiang province's Fenghua County in
eastern China.</P>
      <P>Chiang's favorite residence was converted into his temporary resting site after
his death on April 5, 1975 and opened to visitors.</P>
      <P>But the mysterious grounds behind the mausoleum remained under the control of
the Ministry of National Defense (MND) , making it impossible for the public to
appreciate the beauty of the location or Chiang's security precautions.</P>
      <P>The trail into the lush woodlands of the restricted area is punctuated with
blockhouses, stone-walled sentry posts and bomb shelters, reflecting the
tensions between Chiang's government and its Chinese communist rival and his
concern for his own safety.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan county government plans to turn the scenic spot, with its hilly
woods and quiet pond, into a site for concerts or other public events. The few
buildings in the area dubbed "rear Cihhu" have been renovated into exhibition
halls, awaiting visitors to witness relics from the Chiang era.</P>
      <P>Su Wen-shen, the supervisor of Dasi Township where Cihhu is located, hopes that
after President-elect Ma takes office on May 20, areas closed to the public,
including "rear Cihhu, " will be open to everybody.</P>
      <P>The stakes for Dasi and the county are high. They hope Chiang's resting place
and the opening of the restricted area will boost local tourism and increase the
NT$400 million to NT$500 million (US$13.11 million to US$16.39 million) in an
annual revenues Cihhu tourism is estimated to have injected into the area in
recent years.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the new opening, the Taoyuan Tourism Marketing Department has
also created a Chiang Family Culture Park, which integrates period pieces and
buildings related to Chiang and his son Chiang Ching-kuo, who was entombed in
Dasi's Touliao in 1988.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County officials acknowledge that the area behind the elder Chiang's
mausoleum, which remains off-limits to visitors to this day, lacks any eye-

      <P>A group of foreign Christian missionaries drew attention Friday at a public
cemetery in Taichung City, central Taiwan, when they assisted locals in weeding
their family tombs and cleaning the cemetery.</P>
      <P>The missionaries were volunteering at the cemetery to mark Tomb-Sweeping Day, a
national holiday in Taiwan where families remember deceased relatives by
sprucing up their tombs.</P>
      <P>More than 50 missionaries of the U.S.-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints -- commonly called the Mormon Church -- appeared at the No. 32 cemetery
to help with the tomb-sweeping activities.</P>
      <P>The missionaries said they were happy to make the effort because it was a good
way to engage in cultural exchanges with local residents and an opportunity to
become more familiar with traditional Taiwanese culture.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of weekend charter flights will require consultations between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait and cannot be decided by Taiwan unilaterally, a
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-hsun was responding to media reports that president-elect Ma Ying-jeou
has met with his staff on the plan for direct cross-strait flights, one of his
key campaign promises.</P>
      <P>The reports indicated that if everything progresses as expected, the weekend
charter flight services will begin July 4.</P>
      <P>Liu noted, however, that according to an agreement reached between Taipei and
Beijing on cross-strait charter flights in 2006, there are only four kinds of
charter flight service -- special charter cargo flights, regular charter
passenger flights for special holidays and the operation of charter services for
emergency medical needs or humanitarian purposes.</P>
      <P>Regular charter flight services are available during the Chinese New Year,
Tombsweeping Day, Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays between
Taoyuan and Kaohsiung in Taiwan and Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Xiamen in
China.</P>
      <P>"Weekend charter flight service does not fall into the four categories," Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that the original agreement says any adjustment in the plan requires
consultations by related agencies, even if it just involves an increase in the
number of flights or flight destinations, "not to mention the addition of cross-
strait charters on weekends."</P>
      <P>"Even if the MAC looks forward to the realization of weekend cross-strait
charter flight service, consultations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
will be essential, " he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei  Stray Cats Protection Association (SCPA) held a parade in Taipei
Friday to celebrate Taiwan Cat Day and called on local residents to show more
compassion for stray cats.</P>
      <P>"We hope to raise awareness of the existence of Taiwan Cat Day on April 4, as it
is generally known as Women and Children's Day here in Taiwan, " said Hsiao
Chun, a member of the nonprofit organization.</P>
      <P>The goal of the event, which was the first of its kind in Taiwan, was to
familiarize those who do not have cats with the animals' behavior and compel cat
owners to act more responsibly, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>"We hope whoever decides to keep a cat will think twice before actually adopting
one because it is a lifetime responsibility, " she added.</P>
      <P>At the parade, some cat lovers dressed as catwomen while others brought their
cats to play with passers-by and promote the idea of adoption.</P>
      <P>Ren  Shan-shan,  who  adopted  a stray  cat  with  feline immunodeficiency virus
(FIV or feline AIDS) , said her two-year-old cat Morphine was no different from
normal healthy cats.</P>
      <P>"Cats with FIV will not pass it on to human beings or other kinds of animal. It
is just difficult for them to recover from the illness,"she said.</P>
      <P>She added that Morphine was her second cat with FIV, but she became fond of it
from the first moment she saw it.</P>
      <P>Many people prefer kittens because they are cuter but grown-up cats are more
independent and can take care of themselves,she said.</P>
      <P>SCPA was founded in 2006 by a group of volunteers and cat lovers and was
recognized by the Taipei City Government aiming to promote awareness and respect
of animal rights.</P>
      <P>Stray animals are a serious problem in Taiwan. Only 36 percent of the strays in
Taipei City are neutered, far less than the 70 percent in the United States,
according to the Taipei Municipal Institute for Animal Health.</P>
      <P>Due to the limited number of shelters available to hold stray cats, animal
protection groups have advocated more aggressively encouraging adoption and
urged the government to increase its budget for animal contraception and its
trap, neuter, release (TNR) project, while reducing the amount spent on
slaughtering unwanted animals.</P>

(By Howard Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Friday
that he will visit the mausoleums of two late presidents from his party --
Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo -- on April 5 to observe the 33rd
anniversary of Chiang Kai-shek's death, adding that he will continue to do so
each year after he takes office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Chiang Kai-shek's remains were entombed at the Cihhu presidential burial place
in the northern county of Taoyuan after his death on April 5, 1975. The body of
his elder son, Chiang Ching-kuo, who was president of Taiwan between 1978 and
1988, was laid to rest in Touliao, also in Taoyuan, after he passed away on
Jan.13, 1988.</P>
      <P>The Cihhu and Toulaio sites were closed to public access on Dec. 24, 2007 by the
current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration as part of its efforts
to downplay the legacy of the Chiangs.</P>
      <P>Noting that judgment on the Chiangs is open to discussion, Ma told CNA reporters
that the purpose of his visit to the mausoleums was to "commemorate the deaths
of the former Kuomintang (KMT) leaders," and should not be branded as an act of
"worship."</P>
      <P>Ma said that he was not very concerned about any controversy over his visit to
the tombs, stressing that "everyone can hold different views on history."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the DPP's renaming on May 19, 2007 of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall in downtown Taipei as the National Taiwan Democracy Hall, Ma said he was
concerned about the "legitimacy" of the change.</P>
      <P>"Your views may be different from mine, but you cannot coerce me into adhering
to your opinions," said Ma, adding that divergent opinions within the society
should be tolerated.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is already a mature democracy, " he said, citing as proof the recently
concluded presidential election in which he and his running mate Vincent Siew
won over 7.6 million votes, or 58.45 percent of the ballots cast.</P>

      <P>A sponsorship program launched in 2005 by the Government Information Office
(GIO) to support 10,000 children in Southeast Asian countries affected by a
devastating tsunami in late 2004 will come to an end on Sept. 30, GIO Minister
Shieh Jhy-wey said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The three-year program, which raised more than NT$407.5 million (US$13.4

    <HEADLINE>Ma: Taiwan to join international organizations under 'Chinese Taipei'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4 (CNA)
04/04/08  20:51:20

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's President-elect Ma Ying-jeou signaled his intention Friday to employ
pragmatism and flexibility in his foreign policy, stating that "Chinese Taipei"
is an acceptable name for Taiwan to use in international organizations, a
suggestion that represented a significant departure from the position of the
current administration.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency Friday, Ma, when asked
about the sensitive name issue, said, "Has there been any success (in joining
international organizations) by using any names other than 'Chinese Taipei'?
Except for the even worse 'Taipei, China,' is there a more acceptable name
than'Chinese Taipei?'"</P>
      <P>Following Ma's landslide victory in the March 22 presidential election,
Taiwan's  foreign policy is expected  to undergo a fundamental shift from a pro-
independence approach under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government to
a policy of what Ma called "modus vivendi," within which dignity, pragmatism and
flexibility are the fundamental principles.</P>
      <P>The upcoming World Health Assembly (WHA) , the WHO's governing body that is
scheduled to open May 19 in Geneva, one day before Ma's inauguration, is seen
likely to be the first crucial test of the relationship between China and Ma's
new administration.</P>
      <P>Ma indicated that Taiwan should continue to apply for WHO observer status, but
he strongly opposed the idea of application for full membership under the name
Taiwan, a strategy the DPP government adopted last year. Ma referred to the
DPP's approach as a "total embarrassment, " that resulted in a WHO delegate of
an allied country avoiding the vote on Taiwan's application under the pretext of
having diarrhea.</P>
      <P>Referring to the title Taiwan uses in the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
and the World Trade Organization (WTO) , Ma said he believes that "Chinese
Taipei" is workable, noting that even China has not objected to that name.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's expulsion from the United Nations and affiliated organizations in
1971, it has been isolated from major international activities, managing to
retain only 23 allies, to date. Taiwan's efforts to participate in international
organizations has met with strong opposition from China. One rare exception is
the WTO which allowed Taiwan to join under the name "Separate Customs Territory
of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matzu," and also refers to the country as "Chinese
Taipei."</P>
      <P>Emphasizing the principles of his policy of modus vivendi, Ma also called for
reconciliation in the international arena between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, saying that even China has gradually accepted Taiwan's de facto
existence, a situation that he said makes peaceful co-existence possible.</P>
      <P>The president-elect however warned Beijing that if it continues to suppress
Taiwan, the Taiwanese people, if stripped of dignity, would choose to fight
back, a consequence that would not serve the interests of either side, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma also strongly criticized President Chen Shui-bian for having already issued
order to apply for WHO membership using last year's formula, a move that Ma said
was "very unfair to us."</P>
      <P>"President Chen is about to step down, but the new government will bear the
consequences of possible failure (of the application)," Ma said. "President Chen
can certainly claim that he is consistent... but we object to the legacy he is
leaving us."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's president-elect Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Friday his "mutual non-denial"
position in dealing with Beijing and said China will continue to be defined as
the "mainland area" in the law governing relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency in which he outlined his
stance toward China, Ma indicated that at present, "mutual recognition (between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait) is not possible, while mutual denial is
unnecessary. Therefore only mutual non-denial can provide space for
interaction."</P>
      <P>He said that China once refused to face the reality of Taiwan's existence but
now only emphasized its objection to Taiwan's "de jure independence, " a clear
indication that Taiwan and China can find a way to co-exist peacefully.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, mutual non-denial implies that "we will not deny their
(China's) existence but we cannot recognize their sovereignty."</P>
      <P>With the Kuomintang-supported Ma emerging victorious in the March 22
presidential election, a sea change in Taiwan's China policy and cross-strait
relationship appears imminent.</P>
      <P>Ma publicly announced during and after the election campaign that he would
launch regular weekend charter flights, open Taiwan to Chinese tourists, relax
restrictions on investment in China, and negotiate the three direct links, a
more open approach to ties with Beijing that marks a reversal of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) policy over the past eight years.</P>
      <P>To cope with the new situation, Ma admitted that "the Act Governing Relations
between Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area" will have to be
amended, but stressed that under the framework of the Constitution of the
Republic of China, "China can not be addressed as the People's Republic of
China."</P>
      <P>Although critics have argued that Ma has oversimplified complex cross-strait
issues and made comments that were not well thought out, the president-elect
said he was fully aware that nothing could be accomplished in a single step.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed he would exert great caution in pursuing ties with China and favored
a gradual approach, but he also emphasized that issues like weekend charter
flights had been sufficiently discussed in past years but were simply not acted
on by the DPP government.</P>
      <P>Noting that China is only part of the KMT's "global-linkage" strategy, Ma
contended that the DPP totally ignored the importance of China and took a hands-
off position instead.</P>
      <P>"The fundamental difference between Ma and the current government will be to
face issues pragmatically, rather than putting them off or facing them blindly,
which is key," he said.</P>
      <P>To normalize economic relations with China, the optimistic Ma said he would look
to sign agreements on protecting investments by Taiwanese businesses in China
and avoiding double taxation, which he did not feel would encounter any
resistance.</P>
      <P>Ma also defended his support for recognizing diplomas issued by Chinese
universities in Taiwan, which critics have said would cost local residents job
opportunities at home.</P>
      <P>He said he supported the policy to facilitate exchanges of students and
professors rather than to enable them to acquire professional licenses in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked if he would mention the "1992 Consensus, " in which the KMT says Taiwan
and China acknowledged "one China" but with different interpretations, in his
May 20 inauguration address, Ma said only that the speech is being drafted and
would not elaborate.</P>
      <P>As for plans for him to visit the U.S. before May 20 and for the U.S. to send a
special envoy to his inauguration, Ma said no decision has been made on either
issue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chang Hsien-yao called on government
agencies Friday to apprise KMT President-elect Ma Ying-jeou early of the
nation's current security situation and the challenges it faces in that regard.</P>
      <P>Chang, a former official of the National Security Council (NSC), noted that Ma
will not take office until May 20, and expressed concern that Ma "might not have
firsthand information on national security or cross-strait issues."</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks came after former NSC secretary-general Ting Yu-chou criticized
Ma as "not being ready to take up his post."</P>
      <P>Ting said that Ma, since his election on March 22, has been talking a lot on
matters with which he's not very familiar, which could have created the
impression that he is "too complacent."</P>
      <P>Ting said that Ma's remarks on issues on which he is not well versed, showed a
"lack of prudence and careful consideration." In making the point, Ting cited
Ma's July timetable for implementing cross-strait charter flights, implying that
it was improper to give a definite date.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Ting's remarks should be seen as "a helpful suggestion, rather
than criticism." Ting served as the head of the National Security Bureau between
1999 and 2001 and the NSC secretary-general between 2001 and 2002 and has rich
experience in matters of "cross-strait relations and national security," Chang
added.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Ting probably thought that national security authorities had
failed to provide Ma with thorough and detailed briefings,  which  Chang  said
are crucial  in preparing  the president-elect for the job.</P>
      <P>Chang urged that the relevant government agencies, including the NSC, Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of National Defense, National Security Bureau and
Mainland Affairs Council arrange a briefing for Ma soon.</P>
      <P>"The briefing should be arranged immediately, instead of waiting until after May
20," he said.</P>

      <P>The eastern Caribbean nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis has sent a congratulatory
telegram on the election of Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Kuomintang as
Taiwan's next president, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>"St. Kitts and Nevis Prime Minister Denzil Douglas sent a congratulatory message
on behalf of his country earlier in the day, " MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said,
adding that the ministry will forward the telegram to Ma's office next Monday
when all public offices reopen after the tomb-sweeping holiday.</P>
      <P>In his message, Yeh said, Douglas also reassured the foreign ministry that the
25-year-old diplomatic relations between his country and Taiwan will remain
intact in the wake of transition of power between different political parties in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Douglas also expressed hopes that bilateral relations will be further deepened
and expanded during Ma's term of office," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Douglas' congratulatory message came after Vice President Annette Lu said in a
media interview earlier this week that the failure of three allies -- Guatemala,
Burkina Faso and St. Kitts -- to send congratulatory messages on Ma's victory in
the March 22 presidential poll was a warning that ties with those countries
could be tenuous.</P>
      <P>Yeh on Thursday acknowledged that the foreign ministry had yet to receive
congratulatory messages from Burkina Faso and St. Kitts, also known as Saint
Christopher and Nevis, but she said the oversight was due to administrative
delays in those two countries.</P>
      <P>She did not mention the situation with Guatemala, but Foreign Minister James
Huang indicated that the Central American country already said soon after Ma was
elected that it would send its vice president to Ma's inauguration ceremony,
signaling the strong ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh said Thursday that St. Kitts and Nevis Gov. Cuthbert Sebastian
will head a delegation to attend Ma's May 20 inauguration, which she said is
proof of stable ties bwteen the two countries. The Caribbean ally opened its
first embassy in Asia in Taipei in January this year.</P>

      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Friday
that he will not run for his party's chairmanship next year.</P>
      <P>"I resigned as the KMT chairman last year, and I feel that that way is fine, "
Ma said in an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>A debate over whether Ma should lead the party while serving as president
emerged after KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung suggested on Wednesday that he was open
to the idea of having Ma hold the two posts concurrently.</P>
      <P>Some party insiders believe such an arrangement would make it easier to
coordinate policy between the party and the government.</P>
      <P>Should Ma want to run for the post, however, the party's charter would have to
be amended prior to the chairmanship election slated for August 2009 to allow
the president to act as party chairman, Wu said at a KMT Central Standing
Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said that if Ma wanted to become party
chairman, whether he would still have to be directly elected by party members or
could become chairman by virtue of having been elected president by a broader
base of voters could also be discussed.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT member, said an advantage of
serving as both the president and the party chairman is that the president could
have his policies implemented by the legislature through the party.</P>
      <P>The KMT holds 80 seats, or nearly three-fourths, of the 113-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>Wang cautioned, however, that a downside to dual leadership would be that it
could lead to the KMT repeating its past mistake of having the government follow
the party line.</P>
      <P>Ma was elected KMT chairman on Aug. 19, 2005, but resigned from the post on Feb.

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to promote Matsu culture as intangible cultural heritage</HEADLINE>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Followers of the folk deity Matsu from both sides of the Taiwan Strait are
planning to seek United Nations approval to have the Matsu culture declared an
intangible world cultural heritage, a promoter said Friday.</P>
      <P>The idea was proposed Friday at a Taiwan Matsu cultural forum at the Jenn Lann
Temple in Dajia in the central county of Taichung, which is a historical site of
worship of Matsu, also known as Chinese goddess of sea. The event was part of
the 2008 Taichung County Matsu International Festival, which began Feb. 21 and
is scheduled to end April 28.</P>
      <P>During the forum, Matsu believers from Japan, South Korea, Australia and
Singapore shared their views on various ways of worshipping the goddess.</P>
      <P>Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng, who also attended the forum, said
that the Matsu culture, which is interwoven with a series of original worship
and pilgrimage ceremonies, is not just a traditional folk religion. According to
Huang, belief in Matsu and her power to bless believers has spread and gained
depth through an increasing number of religious and cultural activities,
including the annual round-the-island pilgrimage of the Dajia Matsu statue.</P>
      <P>For over 200 years, the Jenn Nann Temple in Dajia township has been a religious
mecca for Matsu worshipers in dozens of local villages, and has also drawn huge
numbers of followers from all over the island. The Dajia Matsu pilgrimage in
Spring is an internationally renowned event that draws hundreds of thousands of
pilgrims every year to worship and honor the goddess of the sea.</P>

      <P>Liberal intellectuals in China are highly impressed by the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) candidate Ma Ying-jeou's victory in Taiwan's March 22 presidential
election, a visiting Beijing scholar said Friday.</P>
      <P>"This election has reversed some of the long-held negative impressions of
Taiwan's democratic development," said Li Fan, who has promoted grassroots
elections in China for years and has visited Taiwan several times to observe its
elections.</P>
      <P>Li, in an interview with CNA before he left Taipei for home, said that even as
Taiwan is switching its attention from the poll to the possible lineup of Ma's
administration, intellectuals in China are still earnestly discussing the
election.</P>
      <P>He noted that, based on ideology, some liberal intellectuals in China have not
had good opinions regarding Taiwan's democratic development, and could even be
said to have been "rather negative."</P>
      <P>But the KMT's victory has changed all that, mainly because many intellectuals in
China have perceived that the difference between the "pan-blue" camp, headed by
the KMT, and the "pan-green" parties, led by the incumbent Democratic
Progressive Party administration, lies in one favoring cross-strait unification
and the other insisting on Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>But with Taiwan's second peaceful transition of power through democratic
election, "the liberal intellectuals in China have gone wild," Li said.</P>
      <P>The average Chinese citizen, on the subject of Taiwan's election, has also
expressed the view that "democracy on the other side has borne fruit, while ours
is still under the icy ground."</P>
      <P>Li said that Taiwan also has a high degree of freedom, which he described as "an
inspiration to China."</P>
      <P>He said that democracy needs gradual fermentation, but under Taiwan's influence,
"China's democracy is imminent and unstoppable."</P>

      <P>As of Friday, more than 8,200 people in Taiwan were still waiting for organ
transplants, more than 50 times as many people who have been given transplants
this year, the Taiwan Organ Registry Sharing Center said.</P>
      <P>Liu Chia-chi, deputy executive director of the center, said that only 148 people
have had their wishes fulfilled this year, based on the number of organs
donated.</P>
      <P>Liu said hospitals in Taiwan only register the number of organs donated by
people who had died and not live organ donations, so it was difficult for the
center to know if patients had already received organs from their relatives and
had already been excluded from the waiting list.</P>
      <P>She said that the Department of Health estimated two years ago that around 450
Taiwanese patients travel to China each year to have organ transplants, with
about 300 getting kidney transplants.</P>
      <P>But she said that now that China has banned the sale of organs, organ
transactions have moved to the black market. The impact of this change on
Taiwanese traveling to China to have their kidney and liver transplanted is
"unclear."</P>
      <P>Although organ transplant patients have to take anti-rejection drugs all their
lives, those who take the drug are not necessarily organ transplant patients,
Liu said, citing as an example lupus (SLE) patients.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, it is hard to determine the number of patients who received organ
transplants overseas and returned to Taiwan to take the anti-rejection drug
based simply on data on anti-rejection drugs given under the national health
insurance program," she said.</P>
      <P>The two blind spots in the present registry system are live organ transplants
and organ transplants overseas, she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who has pledged closer economic ties with China,
said Friday his government will first assess which technologies can be exported
to China before determining whether local high-tech firms can establish bigger
presences there.</P>
      <P>The new government will listen to experts' opinions on the matter, Ma told the
Central News Agency in an interview, promising that he will "respect
professionalism and there will not many political considerations."</P>
      <P>Supporting the removal of a restriction that limits Taiwanese companies'
investment in China to up to 40 percent of their net worth, Ma said that
government controls should focus only on technologies, not capital.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that if Taiwan is not the sole source of some technologies for
China, the government's restrictions will only hinder the development of
Taiwanese companies in that market.</P>
      <P>He explained that the U.S. government, which adheres to the Wassenaar
Arrangement on export controls of technologies, had allowed Intel Corp., the
world's biggest chipmaker, to invest in China.</P>
      <P>This obviously shows that 12-inch wafer manufacturing technology is no longer
considered as a key technology, he went on, referring to Intel's construction of
a 12-inch wafer fab in China.</P>
      <P>Ma added that although Taiwan is not a signatory of the Wassenaar Arrangement,
his government will still adopt the convention by 40 countries as a standard.</P>
      <P>The agreement -- which was first signed by 33 countries, including the United
States, in Wassenaar, the Netherlands, in mid-1996 -- is aimed at controlling
the exports of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies to
countries perceived as threats to peace.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan allows local firms to invest in 8-inch wafer plants in China,
which Ma said is no longer an advanced technology there.</P>
      <P>Executives of local semiconductor companies told him that if Taiwan had lifted
the ban on technology transfers two years ago, their market shares would have
grown substantially, Ma said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP-elect's possible attendance at Boao Forum attracts attention</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many observers will be watching closely to see if Vice President-elect Vincent
Siew attends next week's Boao Forum in Hainan, China, in what could be a sign of
the potential for closer ties between Taipei and Beijing under the incoming
Kuomintang (KMT) administration.</P>
      <P>Siew, a seed member of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) , has attended the Boao
Forum every year since its inception in 2001, but with Chinese President Hu
Jintao also scheduled to attend, whether Siew will be able to make the trip
remains uncertain.</P>
      <P>The BFA is a non-governmental, not-for-profit international organization
modelled after the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</P>
      <P>During an interview with CNA Friday, President-elect Ma Ying-jeou said he is
unaware whether Siew will attend this year's BFA meeting.</P>
      <P>"I need to ask Siew about his intention before answering your question in this
regard," Ma told CNA interviewers.</P>
      <P>Asked whether it would be strange if Siew is absent from this year's meeting
scheduled for April 10-13, Ma simply answered: "Yes."</P>
      <P>Sources familiar with the Boao Forum for Asia said Siew has consistently thrown
his full support to its activities over the past year, but following the March
22 presidential election, the situation may have changed.</P>
      <P>"With his election as Taiwan's next vice president, his status has changed and
it has become very sensitive as to whether he will attend the forum's upcoming
conference, " said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>It was said that former Council of Labor Affairs Minister Chan Hou-shen, a close
Siew friend, will attend the upcoming Boao Forum meeting.</P>
      <P>China frowns at the appearance of any high-ranking Taiwanese government official
at international conferences or forums, even in organizations such as the Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in which Taiwan is a full-fledged
member.</P>
      <P>Siew, a former premier and economics minister, has attended the annual Boao
Forum in his capacity as chairman of the Cross-Strait Common Market in the past
few years.</P>
      <P>During the 2007 forum, Siew met with Wu Bangguo, chairman of the National
People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, and asked Wu to help push
Beijing authorities to allow Chinese citizens to make sighseeing trips to Taiwan
as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Siew also proposed at that time that the two sides strengthen cooperation in
mutually beneficial financial, agricultural and energy resource development.</P>
      <P>The founding of the forum was driven by the People's Republic of China and
founded by 26 Australasian states on Feb.27, 2001. It has its fixed address in
Boao, Hainan, China, although the Secretariat is based in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The BFA holds a high-level annual forum for representatives from government,
business, and academia with the focus on economics, integration, cooperation,
social issues, and the environment.</P>
      <P>In addition to its annual meeting, the organization also sponsors other forums
and meetings related to Asian issues.</P>
      <P>Besides Hu, Australian Prime Minister Kein Rudd, Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf and top leaders of 10-plus other countries will also attend this
year's forum, acording to BFA sources.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The eastern Caribbean nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis has sent a congratulatory
telegram on the election of Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Kuomintang as
Taiwan's next president, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>"St. Kitts and Nevis Prime Minister Denzil Douglas sent a congratulatory message
on behalf of his country earlier in the day, " MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said,
adding that the ministry will forward the telegram to Ma's office next Monday
when all public offices reopen after the tomb-sweeping holiday.</P>
      <P>In his message, Yeh said, Douglas also reassured the foreign ministry that the
25-year-old diplomatic relations between his country and Taiwan will remain
intact in the wake of transition of power between different political parties in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Douglas also expressed hopes that bilateral relations will be further deepened
and expanded during Ma's term of office," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Douglas' congratulatory message came after Vice President Annette Lu said in a
media interview earlier this week that the failure of three allies -- Guatemala,
Burkina Faso and St. Kitts -- to send congratulatory messages on Ma's victory in
the March 22 presidential poll was a warning that ties with those countries
could be tenuous.</P>
      <P>Yeh on Thursday acknowledged that the foreign ministry had yet to receive
congratulatory messages from Burkina Faso and St. Kitts, also known as Saint
Christopher and Nevis, but she said the oversight was due to administrative
delays in those two countries.</P>
      <P>She did not mention the situation with Guatemala, but Foreign Minister James
Huang indicated that the Central American country already said soon after Ma was
elected that it would send its vice president to Ma's inauguration ceremony,
signaling the strong ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh said Thursday that St. Kitts and Nevis Gov. Cuthbert Sebastian
will head a delegation to attend Ma's May 20 inauguration, which she said is
proof of stable ties bwteen the two countries. The Caribbean ally opened its
first embassy in Asia in Taipei in January this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Followers of the folk deity Matsu from both sides of the Taiwan Strait are
planning to seek United Nations approval to have the Matsu culture declared an
intangible world cultural heritage, a promoter said Friday.</P>
      <P>The idea was proposed Friday at a Taiwan Matsu cultural forum at the Jenn Lann
Temple in Dajia in the central county of Taichung, which is a historical site of
worship of Matsu, also known as Chinese goddess of sea. The event was part of
the 2008 Taichung County Matsu International Festival, which began Feb. 21 and
is scheduled to end April 28.</P>
      <P>During the forum, Matsu believers from Japan, South Korea, Australia and
Singapore shared their views on various ways of worshipping the goddess.</P>
      <P>Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng, who also attended the forum, said
that the Matsu culture, which is interwoven with a series of original worship
and pilgrimage ceremonies, is not just a traditional folk religion. According to
Huang, belief in Matsu and her power to bless believers has spread and gained
depth through an increasing number of religious and cultural activities,
including the annual round-the-island pilgrimage of the Dajia Matsu statue.</P>
      <P>For over 200 years, the Jenn Nann Temple in Dajia township has been a religious
mecca for Matsu worshipers in dozens of local villages, and has also drawn huge
numbers of followers from all over the island. The Dajia Matsu pilgrimage in
Spring is an internationally renowned event that draws hundreds of thousands of
pilgrims every year to worship and honor the goddess of the sea.</P>
      <P>The complex and creative Matsu-worshipping  ceremonies  and activities have been
listed by the Discovery Channel as one of three major religious festivals in the

      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Friday
that he will not run for his party's chairmanship next year.</P>
      <P>"I resigned as the KMT chairman last year, and I feel that that way is fine, "
Ma said in an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>A debate over whether Ma should lead the party while serving as president
emerged after KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung suggested on Wednesday that he was open
to the idea of having Ma hold the two posts concurrently.</P>
      <P>Some party insiders believe such an arrangement would make it easier to
coordinate policy between the party and the government.</P>
      <P>Should Ma want to run for the post, however, the party's charter would have to
be amended prior to the chairmanship election slated for August 2009 to allow
the president to act as party chairman, Wu said at a KMT Central Standing
Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said that if Ma wanted to become party
chairman, whether he would still have to be directly elected by party members or
could become chairman by virtue of having been elected president by a broader
base of voters could also be discussed.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT member, said an advantage of
serving as both the president and the party chairman is that the president could
have his policies implemented by the legislature through the party.</P>
      <P>The KMT holds 80 seats, or nearly three-fourths, of the 113-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>Wang cautioned, however, that a downside to dual leadership would be that it
could lead to the KMT repeating its past mistake of having the government follow
the party line.</P>
      <P>Ma was elected KMT chairman on Aug. 19, 2005, but resigned from the post on Feb.
23, 2007 immediately after he was indicted for allegedly misusing his special
allowance funds during his eight-year term as mayor of Taipei City between 1998
and 2006.</P>

      <P>More than 50 members of the U.S. Congress have extended their congratulations to
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou on his March 22 election win, Taiwan's
representative to the United States said Friday.</P>
      <P>According  to Joseph Wu during an informal gathering with Taiwanese reporters in
Washington, D.C., the maturity and rationality demonstrated by the Taiwanese
people and the democratic manner in which the outcome of the election was
accepted by Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties have won the praise of
Congress leaders, including House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi
(D-Calif.) , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) , Senate Republican Whip
Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), and House Republican Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).</P>
      <P>They believe the Taiwanese people should be proud of their democratic system and
that Taiwan's experience in pursuing democracy can become a model for other
countries in the Asia-Pacific region and even around the world, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Other Congress leaders who have sent their congratulations to Ma include Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations Chairman Joseph Biden (D-Del.) and ranking
minority member Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), as well as House Committee  on Foreign
Affairs Chairman Howard Berman (D-Calif.) , according to data provided by
Taiwan's representative office in the United States.</P>
      <P>Members of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus and Senate Taiwan Caucus, who have
been working to promote U.S.-Taiwan relations, have also congratulated Ma.</P>
      <P>In their congratulatory messages, the Congress members emphasize the importance
of U.S.-Taiwan relations in light of the many common interests between the two
sides, including democracy, human rights, the rule of law, trade, and peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region, Wu said.</P>
      <P>They also express the wish to continue to cooperate with Taiwan to strengthen
bilateral ties, Wu went on.</P>
      <P>He expressed  appreciation  for the firm support and deep friendship displayed
by the Congress members for Taiwan, adding that he believes Taiwan's cooperation
and exchanges with Congress will grow even stronger in the future based on the
existing foundation.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, Wu said he wrote to Pelosi a day earlier to express Taiwan's
support for the attention paid by Congress to the Tibet issue in the wake of
China's recent crackdown on Tibetan protesters.</P>
      <P>In addition to offering firm support for the Tibetans and people in other
regions of China, Wu also said in the letter that Taiwan must resist the threats
posed by China against the country's democracy and freedom, which include the
more-than 1,400 missiles deployed by China targeting Taiwan and Beijing's
continued efforts to isolate Taiwan in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Noting that the long-standing support provided by the United States for Taiwan
has been a major reason why Taiwan has been able to establish a democratic and
prosperous society, Wu said China's recent crackdown in Tibet demonstrates that
it is very important for the United States to continue to support Taiwan as a
beacon of democracy and freedom in East Asia.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan looks forward to continuing a strong partnership with the United
States to face the numerous challenges that are threatening security, freedom
and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A decision on whether salaries for military personnel, civil servants and public
school teachers should be raised in 2009  will  be left  for the incoming
administration  of president-elect  Ma Ying-jeou to make,  Directorate General
of Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)  Minister Hsu Chang-yao said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsu said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on "whether salaries
should be raised or not and what the adjustment level should be."</P>
      <P>He made the remarks one day after Ma said that in the face of import-induced
inflation, Taiwan's short-term strategy will be to expand domestic demand, while
the middle- and long-term strategies will be to increase incomes, with salary
hikes for military personnel, civil servants and public school teachers one of
the options in an overall review.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that when Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's Cabinet mulled raising salaries
for military personnel, civil servants and teachers last year, it considered
consumer prices and the financial situation, as well as the two major elections
of 2008.</P>
      <P>"To avoid giving the impression that the salary hikes were aimed at wooing
ballots from those groups,  Chang's Cabinet decided against them, " he said,
adding that "the Cabinet also thought that 2009 would be a suitable time to make
the adjustment."</P>
      <P>Hsu said that if the salaries were raised by 3 percent, the central government
would have to shoulder the additional costs of around NT$18.5 billion (US$612.17
million).</P>
      <P>Central Personnel Administration Director Chou Hung-hsien also noted that the
Executive Yuan usually decides in July or August whether to raise salaries prior
to working out its general budget for the following year.</P>
      <P>Chou said the Executive Yuan's decision against salary hikes in 2008 took into
consideration the relatively stable consumer prices and the government's
financial situation, as well as the fact that salaries in the private sector had
not seen any dramatic increases.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party administration raised salaries for military
personnel, civil servants and school teachers in 2001 and 2005 during its eight-
year rule, each time by 3 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that he does not advocate "directly
exporting democracy" to China, adding that through greater cross-Taiwan Strait
interaction, the merits of Taiwan's democracy will "naturally" lead to positive
change in China over time.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with CNA, Ma said that because of ideology, Taiwan in
the past only looked at China as a threat, ignoring the opportunities it
presented.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should adjust its policies and use its own "soft strengths" to
influence China by engaging in greater cross-strait interaction.</P>
      <P>During and after the election campaign, Ma announced that he would launch
regular direct cross-strait weekend charter flights, open Taiwan to Chinese
tourists, relax restrictions on investment in China, and negotiate the "three
direct links" -- a more open approach to ties with Beijing that marks a reversal
of the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party administration's policy over its
past eight years in power.</P>
      <P>Ma told CNA that through greater non-political exchanges between the two sides,
the attraction of Taiwan's democratic values will inevitably exert their
influence on China, with the resulting benefits to Taiwan's national defense
being greater than by simply increasing defense spending.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Taiwan's democratic process on display for Chinese people in
countries around the world to see in the recent presidential election, in which
the losing candidate gracefully accepted defeat after the hotly contested race
and the winner declared victory in a humble manner, "shook China like nothing
else could."</P>
      <P>On whether Taiwan should try to export democracy to China, the president-elect
said this is not necessary, as the development of modern  communications,
including  the Internet  and satellite television, means that many people have
access to information and can see the merits of Taiwan's democracy directly.</P>
      <P>To back up his point, Ma recalled a message he read on the China-based People's
Daily Web site following Taiwan's "three in one" elections in 2005.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the citizen who posted the message asked: "Why can the
Taiwanese people go to their neighborhood elementary school and cast ballots in
an election and we cannot? Is it possible that we really are second-class
citizens?"</P>
      <P>Ma said that he was greatly moved by the message and felt that this sort of
reflection -- spurred by Taiwan's democratic process -- demonstrates the immense
power and usefulness of Taiwan's "soft strengths."</P>
      <P>Ma pointed to his support for Taiwanese recognition of diplomas issued by
Chinese universities as an example of how his policies will help utilize
Taiwan's "soft strengths." He said it is hoped that recognizing Chinese degrees
will lead to a greater number of Chinese students opting to study in Taiwan, who
will in turn learn more about Taiwan's lifestyle.</P>
      <P>"When these young people who receive their education in Taiwan return home, they
will become some of Taiwan's best friends, " he said.</P>
      <P>"Allowing more young Chinese to understand that Taiwan is a model worth learning
from instead of a place that should be attacked is probably a better way of
ensuring Taiwan's security than boosting the nation's defense spending," he
said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's agro-tourism in the form of leisure farms is attracting increasing
numbers of foreign visitors, especially from Singapore, and has won much praise
in the area of service, an official of the Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>To help transform the farming sector into a service industry, the government is
trying to develop agro-tourism, which gives tourists a taste of life in the
Taiwanese countryside and its produce, along with human interest in the form of
the farmers themselves, the official said.</P>
      <P>The COA began promoting Taiwan's agro-tourism in Singapore in 2005,
participating  in travel exhibitions,  organizing  press conferences and
collaborating with local tour operators.</P>
      <P>The official said Southeast Asia and Hong Kong are the target areas for the
promotion plan as they have in general similar languages, diet preferences and
cultural backgrounds to Taiwan. He added that Singapore, with a population that
is 75 percent of Chinese descent, is one of the countries from which Taiwanese
leisure farm operators are particularly keen to attract tourists.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the Singapore promotion led to a growth rate of 50.68
percent in the number of Singaporean tourists visiting leisure farms in Taiwan,
representing an increase from 10,139 people in 2006 to 15,278 in 2007.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the success of agro-tourism in attracting Singaporeans, the official
said it might be because the city state lacks its own land, agricultural
production, rural ecosystem and rural culture.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Taiwan Leisure Farming Development Association show
that there are more than 100 establishments involved in the leisure agricultural
industry around the country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official reaffirmed Saturday that Taiwan's
diplomatic relations with Guatemala remain stable in the wake of a report that
the recent formation  of a China-Guatemala  chamber of commerce signifies
increased uncertainty in Taiwan-Guatemala ties.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said the ministry is aware of the growing economic
and trade relations between Guatemala and China, but pointed out that the
chamber of commerce is a private organization promoted by a group of Guatemalan
businessmen to support their economic interests in China.</P>
      <P>Yeh said similar organizations also exist in other allies of Taiwan in Central
America and that the ministry will keep close watch on the situation.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, despite a decrease in trade volume between Taiwan and
Guatemala, bilateral relations have continued to grow stably.</P>
      <P>For  example,  Taiwan  has  continued  to support  various infrastructure
construction projects in Guatemala, while agricultural and information
technology cooperation between the two countries is also underway, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>During a summit of business leaders from Taiwan and its Central American allies
held last month,  Taiwanese  businessmen  were encouraged to set up operations
in Central America to promote economic and trade ties with the region, she
noted.</P>
      <P>According to a China Times report, following the inauguration of the China-
Guatemala chamber of commerce earlier this week, a large Chinese investment
delegation will visit Guatemala in June and the first Guatemalan trade show will
take place September in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The report said that in light of Guatemala's economic interests in China,
Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom has turned down Taiwan's invitation  for  him
to attend  the May 20 inauguration  of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>The report also said Colom and two other leaders of Taiwan's diplomatic allies
in Central America will take part in the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing
Olympic Games in August.</P>
      <P>On Colom's expected absence from Ma's inaugural ceremony, Yeh noted that during
a visit by President Chen Shui-bian to Guatemala in January to attend Colom's
inauguration, Colom told Chen he would not be able to attend the inauguration of
Taiwan's new president and would instead assign his deputy to come on his behalf
because operations of the new administration were expected to keep him occupied.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh said the ministry had not received any information indicating
that leaders of Taiwan's Central American allies have any plans to take part in
the Olympics opening ceremony.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has not yet come to a conclusion on how
to handle Taiwan's bid for its access to the World Health Organization (WHO)
this year, Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks after President-elect Ma Ying-jeou said in an exclusive
interview with CNA a day earlier that he thinks Taiwan should continue to apply
for the observer status in the World Health Assembly (WHA), the WHO's decision-
making body.</P>
      <P>As to the proper designation for the bid, Ma said he thinks that there is no
more acceptable name than "Chinese Taipei" for Taiwan to use in international
organizations at present.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Ma said it was learned that President Chen Shui-bian has
instructed the MOFA to follow the 2007 formula in applying for the country's WHO
membership under the name "Taiwan" during this year's WHA conference, scheduled
to open in Geneva May 19, one day before Ma's inauguration. Should that be the
case, Ma said, the application could end up a failure again just like last
year's bid.</P>
      <P>Responding to Ma's remarks, Huang said the MOFA is still pondering the strategy
and the country's designation for this year's WHO bid. "Before May 20, the MOFA
will still follow the incumbent government's policy in addressing the issue," he
explained.</P>
      <P>"Up until now, no definite proposal has been outlined, " Huang said, noting that
the issue is pending discussions among relevant authorities and that the MOFA
will communicate with Ma's office on any possible proposal through proper
channels.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh also stated that the ministry is still working on
strategies and designation for the WHO bid and that relevant government agencies
are scheduled to discuss the issue in the coming week.  Ma won the March 22
presidential election by a decisive margin, a victory that means Taiwan's
foreign policy under the Kuomintang is expected to undergo a fundamental shift
from the pro-independence approach of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government to a policy of what Ma called "modus vivendi" within which dignity,
pragmatism and flexibility are the fundamental principles.</P>
      <P>Speaking of Ma's plans for seeking membership of the WHO -- an organization
that has rejected Taiwan's  application  for its membership for over 10 years
due to China's opposition -- a foreign affairs official well versed in
international organization operations said diplomatic circles were surprised by
Ma's disclosure of his strategies when there is still more than a month to go
before the May 19 opening of the World Health Assembly in Geneva.</P>
      <P>They expect the disclosure to have a mixed effect, said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. On the positive side, he said, Ma's goodwill signals
toward China and the international community shows his intention of employing
pragmatism in his foreign policy, which is different from that of the DPP
administration.</P>
      <P>Ma has also revealed that he will attempt to persuade Beijing to relax its
suppression of Taiwan and will seek support from the United States, Japan and
the European Union in the country's bids for membership in international
organizations.</P>
      <P>The president-elect is being seen as trying to handle diplomatic issues within
the framework of general exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
the official analyzed.</P>
      <P>On the possible negative side, the official went on, local diplomats regard the
name "Chinese Taipei" as more of a step backward than other possible names such
as "the Republic of China (Taiwan) " and "Taiwan (the Republic of China) , " and
more of a backward step, even, than the idea of using the term "health entity"
to designate Taiwan in its WHO bid.</P>
      <P>If "Chinese Taipei" is accepted,  there might be no more acceptable name than
that for Taiwan's other international membership applications in the future, he
said.</P>

      <P>The Chinese tradition of Chingming, or Tomb Sweeping, a time for people to pay
their respects to their ancestors and clean their graves, began in the Chou
Dynasty some 2,500 years ago and was later set as a festival during the Sui and
Tang Dynasties</P>
      <P>Usually falling on April 5 of the Gregorian calendar, the Chingming Festival
this year occurred a day earlier -- on April 4 -- due to 2008 being a leap year
and giving people in Chinese societies such as Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and
Macau a three-day vacation.</P>
      <P>To observe the holiday, as well as to pay respects to the ancestors and tidy up
their graves, returning home is an essential task for most people prior to the
beginning of the festival, leading to soaring demand for transport.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau (TANFB) under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC), loading on the three national freeways
April 3, the day before the festival, was up 16 percent compared to normal days.
On April 4, 2.55 million cars were also reported using the freeways, breaking
the record of the previous Chingming Festival.</P>
      <P>Passenger  numbers recorded by the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC) on
the high-speed railway linking Taipei in the north and the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, also broke its record with 120,000 passengers April 3, forcing the
THSRC to lay on extra trains to accommodate the crowds.</P>
      <P>Freeways, stations and piers in Hong Kong and Macau, as well as in China where
the Chingming Festival was officially being celebrated as a holiday for the
first time, also saw multitudes of passengers traveling home for the festival.</P>
      <P>An estimate released by the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau indicated that
graveyards around the city saw 2.37 million tomb sweepers during the three-day
vacation, a 56 percent increase over last year, with roads leading to graveyards
and around Shanghai's neighboring cities or towns packed with cars, causing
tailbacks that stretched for kilometers.</P>
      <P>Queues were to be seen on the piers in Hong Kong and Macau as well, as many Hong
Kong citizens visited the tombs of their ancestors buried in Macau.</P>
      <P>Tomb sweepers not only had to brave the heavy traffic but also had to suffer
from the air pollution caused by the burning of piles of "ghost money."</P>
      <P>According to Chinese tradition, people must prepare food, drinks, "ghost money"
and incense as offerings to the gods or their ancestors. After a ceremony, the
money is burned for use by the gods or the dead.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent fire, the Agriculture,  Fisheries and Conservation
Department (AFCD) under the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administration
Region, warned the public to take care not to start fires while burning "ghost
money" or setting off firecrackers.</P>
      <P>A maximum fine of HK$25,000 (US$3,278) was also introduced as part of the AFCD's
effort to prevent fire.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan,  meanwhile,  fire brigades  were geared up for emergencies. In
Kaohsiung County, some 350 km south of the capital Taipei City, 42 fires were
reported, while many other minor fires were started by careless citizens
elsewhere in the country.</P>
      <P>Based on the findings of recent research on "ghost money, " the Taiwan based
Consumers' Foundation, Chinese Taipei (CFCT) noted that 20 percent of "ghost
money" tested contains lead, making it extremely hazardous for those forced to
breathe the fumes when it is burned.</P>
      <P>CFCT Chairman Cheng Jen-hung pointed out that "exposure to excessive  amounts
of lead can cause brain damage,  learning difficulties and slow growth among
children... adults suffering from lead poisoning will feel pain in the muscles
and joints, and their blood pressure will also rise."</P>
      <P>In order to reduce air pollution and safeguard public heath, the authorities in
Taiwan have been promoting the burning of "ghost credit cards" or "ghost
cheques" instead of large amounts of "cash, " but these moves have proved
unpopular.</P>
      <P>The three day vacation of the Chingming Festival this year ends Sunday. Even
though the Chinese tradition will surely continue in Chinese populations around
the world, finding ways to make future festivals more travel-friendly and
environmentally friendly will need to be considered.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA urges diversification of sources to ensure coal supply</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Saturday that since Taiwan relies
entirely on imports for its coal supply, it has to diversify its import sources
to ensure smooth operations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also needs to sign long-term purchase contracts to stabilize its coal
supplies, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has in recent years encouraged users to diversify its import sources, the
officials said, noting that total coal imports amounted to around 65 million
tons last year, mainly from Australia, Indonesia and China, accounting for 39
percent, 37 percent and 20 percent, respectively of the total imports.</P>
      <P>The ministry has instructed Taiwan Power Co. to step up coal exploration
overseas so as to ensure a steady supply, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>They noted that world coal prices have continued to surge since 2003, mainly
because of the rise of China and India, which has led to massive demand and
tight supply.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that major coal producers such as Australia have seen coal
prices rise by 46 percent since early this year.</P>
      <P>China announced Jan. 24 a suspension of coal exports for two months because of
its own urgent need for coal and electricity due to heavy snowstorms that
wreaked havoc in some areas of the country, while production in South Africa's

    <HEADLINE>Music fans flock to southern Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)

(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of several music festivals in southern Taiwan attracted tens of
thousands of music fans who crowded into the township of Kenting over the
weekend to enjoy different kinds of music, while the authorities questioned the
impact of the events on the ecosystem of the Kenting National Park.</P>
      <P>April used to be an off-season for tourism in Kenting, a popular scenic spot
famed for its beaches, good weather and the richness of its sub-tropical
ecosystem.</P>
      <P>Since the "Spring Scream" music and art festival took place for the first time
in Kenting in April 1995, the annual event has attracted tens of thousands of
tourists and brought great benefits to businesses in the township, said Shi Jin-
fang, director of the Kenting National Park Administration Office (KNPAO).</P>
      <P>With the success of Spring Scream, more and more outdoor concerts and music
festivals are now organized in Kenting in April. "Today, the profits made from
the music festivals can match those of the Chinese New Year period, " she said.</P>
      <P>While the event does boost the economy, however, it harms the environment of the
national park, the KNPAO said, indicating that about 200,000 people crowded into
the Henchun peninsula over several days in the 2007 festivals, which means not
only a great opportunity for business operators but also eventual environmental
degradation in the township.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid developing the economy at the expense of nature, the KNPAO
will ask academics and experts to discuss the issue in the coming year, the
public institution said, adding that it will assess the impact caused by the
festivals on the environment, to see whether the event should continue to be
held in the national park in the future, or whether its scale should be limited.</P>
      <P>"Spring Scream" was founded in Taiwan by two foreign musicians who decided to
create the festival in 1995 to encourage the development of independent bands
and original creations.</P>
      <P>In 2008, about 250 mostly local bands have been invited to perform in this
year's three-day program.</P>
      <P>Besides "Spring Scream, " seven other music festivals have been organized on the
Henchun peninsula this year, with an estimated 100,000 people expected to arrive
in Kenting to enjoy the music on Saturday night, according to local police.</P>
      <P>Designated as a national park in 1984, the Kenting National Park was the first
of seven in Taiwan. Located in the southernmost region of the island, it
features coral reef cliffs and rich sub-tropical biodiversity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President-elect unlikely to visit U.S. before taking office</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former high-ranking U.S. official expressed doubt Friday that President-elect
Ma Ying-jeou will be invited to visit Washington D.C. prior to his May 20
inauguration.</P>
      <P>Randy Schriver, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, made the comment at a workshop held by the Heritage Foundation,
a Washington think tank, for discussions on Taiwan's just-concluded presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Schriver,  however,  said he himself  fully  supports  the president-elect
making a trip to Washington before taking office.</P>
      <P>Asked to explain his doubt, Schriver, an expert in cross-Taiwan Strait affairs,
said he made the comment based purely on his personal judgment rather than from
"inside sources."</P>
      <P>He said the U.S. government will refrain from inviting the president-elect to
visit Washington before his inauguration out of concern that such an invitation
might set a precedent that could present unwanted consequences in the future.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government will think that a more appropriate time for Ma to come to
the United States will be when he goes abroad after assuming office and can use
the foreign trip to conduct a transit stop on U.S. soil, Schriver said.</P>
      <P>The former U.S. official suggested that Ma should engage in dialogue with
Washington through phone calls or video conferences if he cannot come to the
U.S. before his inauguration, or even use a trip to other country to make a
stopover in the U.S. possible.</P>
      <P>At the workshop, Deputy Representative Chang Ta-tung of the U.S. office of the
opposition Kuomintang and its political ally, the People First Party, said they
are still working to organize a trip for Ma to Washington D.C. before his
inauguration.</P>
      <P>Mentioning that the U.S. side has told the media it is pondering what to do
about Ma's desire to visit, Chang expressed optimism, saying that "anything
could happen."</P>
      <P>Asked whether there are discussions on replacing Washington with other U.S.
cities, Chang said that "all I can say is that everyone is talking about the
issue with delight."</P>
      <P>Top-ranking official exchanges between Taiwan and the United States have been a
sensitive issue amid the absence of formal diplomatic relations and opposition
from China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President-elect calls for using Chiang's legacy for tourism</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou called Saturday for leaving the historical roles of
the two late presidents -- Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo -- to
the historians, but said their legacies should be used to help develop tourism.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that the Chiangs dominated Taiwan's political scene from the 1950s
until 1988 and said that "their merits and shortcomings should be left for the
historians to decide."</P>
      <P>But he added that the two late presidents have left great legacies, which he
said could be used as historical and cultural assets and for tourism
development.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while taking part in a creative doll festival that included
figurines of the late Chiangs and the unveiling of a renovated Chiang Kai-shek
statute -- the largest in the country -- in Cihhu, also spelled as Tzuhu, in the
northern county of Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that Taoyuan has an international airport which is Taiwan's main
gateway to the world, and also hosts the two late presidents' mausoleums, which
could be valuable assets in developing tourism.</P>
      <P>Ma said that a Chiang cultural park beside Cihhu has 141 statutes of Chiang Kai-
shek, many of which were collected from cities and counties around the nation in
a campaign launched by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to remove
statutes of Chiang in a bid to get rid of the last vestiges of his authoritarian
rule.</P>
      <P>"With the incoming administration's plan to open up Taiwan to Chinese tourists
in July, the cultural heritage of the Chiangs and their residences will become
popular tourist attractions," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma also pledged that after he assumes office May 20, he will appropriate NT$30
billion for a tourism development fund and NT$30 billion for a local industrial
development fund in a bid to boost the tourism and cultural development of
Taiwan's cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Ma, who began his political career serving as English secretary to Chiang Ching-
kuo, earlier visited the two mausoleums, a ritual he practices every year.</P>
      <P>He was emotional and teary-eyed when paying his respects at Chiang Ching-kuo's
mausoleum in Touliao, also in Taoyuan County.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's  quest for World Health Organization (WHO) entry has been obstructed by
Beijing's "one China" stance, not by the issue of how Taiwan should be
designated, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Shieh issued the clarification at a news conference held a day after president-
elect Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said in an interview
with CNA that he was informed that President Chen Shui-bian has directed the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) to follow last year's formula in applying for
WHO membership when this year's World Health Assembly (WHA) convenes in Geneva
May 19. The WHA is the WHO's decision-making body.</P>
      <P>The government applied to join the WHO in the name of Taiwan for the first time
last year, which was rejected due to China's opposition.</P>
      <P>"If such a formula is employed again this year, the result would be the same, "
Ma said, adding that it would be unfair to have his administration bear the
blame for such a consequence.</P>
      <P>During the interview, Ma further said he feels that there is no more acceptable
name that "Chinese Taipei" for Taiwan to use in applying for membership in
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Ma's remarks, Shieh said the country began to apply for WHO entry
under its official title "Republic of China" in 1997 when the KMT was in power.
The formula was followed by the Democratic Progressive Party administration
after President Chen assumed office in 2000.</P>
      <P>As none of those bids were successful, Shieh said the DPP administration adopted
a new strategy last year by using the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We all know that the only reason behind our failure over the past decade lies
in China's uncompromising insistence on its 'one China' principle which claims
Taiwan is part of Chinese territory, " Shieh argued, adding that both Ma and his
party are fully aware of this crucial problem.</P>
      <P>Stressing that President Chen and the DPP government have been striving hard to
shun Beijing's "one China" framework, Shieh said it is regrettable that Ma and
the KMT have publicly embraced the "one China" concept.</P>
      <P>Shieh also criticized Ma for "singing duet with Beijing" in blaming the DPP-
ruled Taiwan as a "troublemaker, " referring to Ma's promise in a recent
interview with the London-based international news agency Reuters that his
administration will lead Taiwan to play the role of a responsible stakeholder
and peacemaker in cross-Taiwan Strait affairs instead of being a troublemaker as
it was in the past few years.</P>
      <P>During his two-year stint as Taiwan's representative to Germany, Shieh said he
had discussed with European Union officials China's opposition  to Taiwan's
participation  in major  international organizations. "We all agree that the
root cause of their opposition is their 'one China' notion, not the designation
issue, " he explained.</P>
      <P>Recalling that Ma often chanted Taiwan-themed or Taiwan-centric campaign slogans
in the run-up to the March 22 presidential poll, Shieh said it is sad for him to
hear Ma's acceptance of the so-called "1992 consensus" between then-KMT
government and Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT, the "1992 consensus" refers to a tacit understanding
between it and Beijing authorities that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong
to "one China," but each side is eligible to define what "one china" means. For
the KMT, "one China" refers to the Republic of China, Taiwan's official national
title.</P>
      <P>"Should that be the case, Taiwan should be able to join the international
organizations under its official title Republic of China, " Shieh said, adding
that Ma should not have just mentioned "Chinese Taipei" as an acceptable title
for Taiwan's designation in world organizations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the incumbent DPP government has not yet decided on its strategy and
formula for applying WHO access this year, Shieh said that if the application
fails again, the only reason should still be same. "That is Beijing's 'one
China' stance, nothing else," he added.</P>

      <P>Using names other than Taiwan in the country's bid to enter the World Health
Organization (WHO) will backfire seriously, a high-ranking official from the
Presidential Office said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The official, who spoke to CNA on condition of anonymity, said that if the
nation uses a title other than Taiwan in its WHO bid, the negative impact will
be greater than using Taiwan if the bid fails again this year.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan's quest for WHO entry has been obstructed by Beijing's "one
China" policy rather than by the issue of how Taiwan should be designated.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the main
opposition Kuomintang, who said in an interview with CNA last week that
following last year's formula in applying for WHO membership in the name of
Taiwan "would be another foreseeable failure."</P>
      <P>Ma said he had been informed that President Chen Shui-bian has directed the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) to follow last year's formula in applying for
WHO membership when this year's World Health Assembly (WHA) convenes in Geneva
May 19. The WHA is the WHO's decision-making body.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration applied to join the WHO in
the name of Taiwan for the first time last year, which was rejected due to
China's opposition.</P>
      <P>"If such a formula is employed again this year, the result will be the same, "
Ma said.</P>
      <P>During the interview, Ma further said he feels that at present, there is no more
acceptable name than "Chinese Taipei" for Taiwan to use in applying for
membership in international organizations.</P>
      <P>Discounting Ma's remarks, the official said that no decision has been made on
this year's designation for Taiwan's WHO bid, adding that officials from the
MOFA, the National Security Council and other relevant agencies will exchange
views on the issue before referring a decision to Chen for final approval.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to apply for WHO entry under its official title Republic of China
in 1997 when the KMT was in power. The formula was continued by the DPP
administration after Chen assumed office in 2000.</P>
      <P>However, since none of those bids were successful, the official said, the DPP
administration adopted a new strategy in 2007, using the name Taiwan for its
bid, which also failed.</P>

      <P>A total of 70 ceramic and earthenware masterpieces  made by 16 contemporary
artists from Taiwan are currently on display at a museum in Beijing as part of
the cultural activities marking the 2008 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>The display -- opened at the National Art Museum of China April 3 -- marks the
first large-scale exhibition in China of work by contemporary artists in
ceramics and earthenware from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is set to run at the leading fine art museum for six months,
according to You Ran-chi, director of the Taipei County Yingge  Ceramics
Museum,  one  of the Taiwanese  and Chinese organizations sponsoring the
exhibition.</P>
      <P>The masterpieces -- telling stories about nature,  people, obsession and
illusion -- reflect that Taiwanese ceramics and earthenware artists have
surpassed the level of designing only practical ware and utensils, You said.</P>
      <P>Rather, You said, the artists represent their artistic thinking and deliver
their cultural attainments via their designs.</P>
      <P>The display is also poised to serve as a new platform to help bolster exchanges
in ceramics, earthenware and related arts across the Taiwan Strait, You added.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese students once again stunned the world with outstanding mathematical
ability as 28 students scored full marks in the American Mathematics Competition
(AMC) this year, the best performance ever, the sponsor said Sunday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>26 out of 6,328 Taiwanese students got perfect scores in the AMC 10 competition
for grade 10, representing 55.32 percent of the total perfect scores from the
whole world compared to 12.8 percent last year.</P>
      <P>In addition, two of 6,075 Taiwanese contestants scored full marks in the AMC 12,
representing 18.18 percent of the total full marks received, compared to 10.5
percent in 2007.</P>
      <P>"It is such a great achievement and again proves that many students in Taiwan
have exceptional talent in math, " said Ho Yien -ming, chairman of the Nine-Nine
Cultural and Educational Foundation, which sponsored the contest in the Taiwan
area, at the award ceremony.</P>
      <P>The AMC, which was established in 1950 and is the first of a series of
competitions for high school mathematics, includes three levels -- AMC 8, AMC 10
and AMC 12 -- for students in grades 8, 10 and 12. The annual event is held by
the American Mathematics Competitions organization.</P>
      <P>Major universities  such as the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology (MIT) are
beginning to take AMC scores as important references in student applications,
since the AMC tests a deeper level of math than the SAT and can help identify
students who are ready for a rigorous undergraduate curriculum.</P>
      <P>Mark Chen from the National Experimental High School at Hsinchu Science Park,
who got perfect scores both in the AMC 12 and the American Invitational
Mathematics Examination, is the first person in Taiwan to get full marks in both
contests.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was born in the United States and came back to continue his senior
high school study in Taiwan three years ago, has already been admitted by MIT
and will enroll this August. The 17-year-old said he is interested in math.</P>
      <P>"You have to pick up the best, the most beautiful parts in math," he said,
adding that he can spend up to 10 hours a day doing math on weekends and can
even spend several days thinking how to solve a math problem.</P>
      <P>"Math helps me think in a more creative way and to analyze things more deeply, "
said Chen, who also finds interest in other subjects such as science and English
literature.</P>
      <P>He said that although the education system in Taiwan is more "strict and
stringent" while it is more "lenient" in the U.S., both are equally good.</P>
      <P>"Both have their own advantages -- leniency will let you have a lot of time to
do what you want to do while strictness gives you discipline," he said.</P>
      <P>Ho said there is a long way to go, as this is only the 7th year in which Taiwan
has competed  in the AMC.  Although Taiwan's performance is one of the top in
the world, China and Singapore should not be neglected, as students there are
doing better and better, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Pilgrimage tour gets modern twist of environmental protection</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An annual pilgrimage tour of Matsu, goddess of the sea, that kicked off Saturday
from a popular central Taiwan temple, got a green twist of environmental
protection, thanks to the participation of a team of environmental workers who
vowed to maintain community cleanliness during the religious procession.</P>
      <P>The environmental protection team, composed of volunteers from business
corporations and social groups, was organized by the Cabinet-level Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA)  and environmental bureaus of four counties
through which the pilgrimage passes.</P>
      <P>Led by EPA Deputy Minister Chang Tzu-ching, the environmental team took part in
a religious ritual at the renowned Jenn Lann Temple in Taichung County's Dajia
township Saturday in preparation for the eight-day pilgrimage tour that
commenced at around midnight that same day.</P>
      <P>The annual parade is part of celebrations of Matsu's birthday, which falls on
the 23rd day of the third lunar month, but is usually celebrated earlier with a
pilgrimage to sister Matsu temples in neighboring Changhua, Yunlin and Chiayi
counties.</P>
      <P>The tradition has been observed for more than a century and has bloomed into
what Discovery Channel describes as one of the three major religious festivals
in the world in recent years thanks to Jenn Lann Temple management's
introduction  of modern marketing and advertising strategies into the program of
festivities.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, the traditional eight-day religious walking event has been
evolved into a month-long carnival that incorporates religious, cultural,
fashion and tourism activities better known as the Taichung County Matsu
International Festival.</P>
      <P>Since the late 1990s, the annual pilgrimage tour has consistently attracted
nearly 1 million Matsu worshipers who follow the Matsu journey on foot. Along
the route, huge quantities of garbage are produced, creating a burden on the
environment.</P>
      <P>According to environmental officials, most of the waste consists of food
packaging, such as empty drink bottles and lunch boxes.</P>
      <P>"For the first time this year, an environmental team will head the procession,
and along the route 6,000 garbage and recycling bins made of recycled paper will
be placed for trash collection and resource recycling to ensure environmental
cleanliness," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Individual team members, including teachers and professionals from various
fields, will also promote the concept of resource recycling and garbage
classification to the townships they will visit, and will remind pilgrims to
maintain environmental cleanliness and good hygiene during the 330-km journey.</P>
      <P>A Jenn Lann Temple manager said the marathon walking event is not only aimed at
inspiring mental purification but also at providing a cleansing experience for
local communities.</P>
      <P>"By combining traditional religious rituals like the Matsu pilgrimage tour with
modern trends like environmental protection, we hope to imbue locals with more
updated notions of what is good for society and the next generation," he added.</P>
      <P>This year's Dajia Matsu festival began Feb. 20 and is scheduled to end April 28.
In addition to the climatic Matsu pilgrimage procession, there are also
exhibitions related to Matsu, who watches over fishermen, as well as folk
cultural performances and fashion shows in and around the 276-year-old Jenn Lann
Temple. To emphasize its global nature, organizers have also invited musical
groups from around the world to perform.</P>

      <P>Singers from a popular televised singing competition had lunch with fans Sunday
at a tea house in Taipei to raise money to allow disadvantaged children to go to
school.</P>
      <P>Lin Pei-yiao, Wu Chung-ming, Yeh Wei-ting and Tzeng Pei-tsi from the second
season of the program titled One Million Stars, met 16 fans who bid on the
Internet for the chance to have lunch with their idols. The highest bid went up
to NT$4,000 (US$131).</P>
      <P>Some NT$30,000 that was raised from the luncheon will be used as tuition fees
for disadvantaged children, said Shi Tu Chien-ming of the Red Heart Association
in Taiwan, which organized the event.</P>
      <P>"These artists have taken part in many charity activities and we hope that by
setting a good example, their fans and the general public will also join efforts
to help the disadvantaged children so that they can go to school, " he said,
adding that anyone can join the charity by donating NT$500 to the Red Heart
Association.</P>
      <P>To express their appreciation for the fans, the four singers first acted as
receptionists and waiters, taking their lunch orders and serving them drinks
before joining them for lunch.</P>
      <P>A flight attendant in "real life, " Lin's professional service made her fans
feel like they were on a first class flight, one of them said afterward.</P>
      <P>"Only by actually going to care centers and orphanages can we really understand
how much help they need and how little we have done, " said Tzeng,  urging
everyone  to help children  from single-parent and low-income families, or those
without parents, to go to school.</P>
      <P>Wu said that as long as there is a need, they are very willing to take part in
charity activities, as it is also their job to educate the public and fans on
how to help the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>"It is so meaningful to be part of charity affairs, especially when you can do
it with your own idols, " said Lucy Liu, a fan of Yeh Wei-ting.</P>
      <P>The Red Heart Association, established in 1988, is a non- government social
service organization that focuses on disadvantaged households rather than
individuals and is responsible for taking care of over 2,000 underprivileged
families in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Japanese tourists making bookings to visit Taiwan during the
upcoming "golden holiday" between late April and early May remains at the same
level as that posted in 2007, a leading travel agency reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the JTB Tourist Agency, 33,000 Japanese
citizens have made reservations to travel to Taiwan for the "golden holiday"
between April 25 and May 5 -- the same number as last year.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the number of Japanese tourists heading to China during the same
period declined by 20 percent -- to 75,000 people from last year's 94,000,
according to the JTB survey.</P>
      <P>JTB, which is Japan's largest travel agency, attributed the sharp decline mainly
to the poisonous Chinese dumplings incident that occurred in Japan late last
year and the ongoing Chinese military crackdown on Tibetan protesters.</P>
      <P>JTB conducted the annual survey among Japanese citizens aged between 15 and 79
recently and obtained 1,200 valid responses.</P>
      <P>The agency also found that 458,000 Japanese citizens have made bookings to
travel overseas during the holiday, representing a year-on-year decline of 14.6
percent from 2007's 536,000.</P>
      <P>According to the agency, the decline is mainly because of difficulty getting
vacation time off work and prohibitively expensive air tickets as a result of
skyrocketing international oil prices.</P>
      <P>China is the top destination, followed by South Korea, which has attracted
74,000 people, and Hawaii, which has attracted 34,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Award-winning baker sets up foundation to aid young people</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local baker who won joint second place with other two Taiwanese bakers at the
2008 Bakery World Cup in Paris April 2, returned to the store where he works as
a pastry chef in the southern port city of Kaohsiung Saturday with a silver cup
and a vow to set up a foundation to aid apprentices in financial plight.</P>
      <P>Wu Pao-chun said his idea of founding the organization was inspired by his late
mother, Chen Wu-hsien, who raised him and her seven other children single-
handed.</P>
      <P>Wu, 39, born in Pingtung County, southern Taiwan, is the youngest in the family
and lost his father when he was a child. Unwilling to see his mother working so
hard to raise her family, Wu dropped out of senior high school and traveled to
Taipei to learn how to be a baker.</P>
      <P>Since then, Wu has moved from one city to another, from northern to southern
Taiwan, absorbing various experiences and baking skills. Last year, Wu defeated
the champion Chinese team at the World Cup Asian qualifying rounds last May,
winning the title of "King of the Asian Bakers."</P>
      <P>On March 31 at the World Cup finals in Paris, Wu used his "secret weapon" --
smoked dried longan -- to make artisan bread with a flavor of his homeland. The
dried longan bread made with sweet fermented rice wine was a hit with the
judges.</P>
      <P>Wu said he created the bread because he missed his late mother. When he was
young, Wu recalled, his mother used to cook longan soup with sweet fermented
rice in winter to keep out the cold.</P>
      <P>"Maybe it was the `flavor of mother' that touched the judges' hearts," he said.</P>
      <P>Wu said he will contribute his money, knowledge and skills to the Chen Wu-hsien
Foundation, to help apprentice bakers suffering from financial problems and
train more world champion bakers for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu, Tsao Chih-hsiung and Wen Shih-cheng represented Taiwan in the Bakery World
Cup held March 31-April 2 in Paris and also won a ticket for the next
competition, scheduled for 2012.</P>
      <P>The triennial baking competition, the seventh of its kind, brought together 12
national teams, including the top three winners of the 2005 competition -- the
United States, France and Japan -- and nine others that qualified for the
finals.</P>
      <P>The other teams were from Turkey, Mexico, Argentina, Poland, Sweden, Spain,
Italy and the Netherlands.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Vice president-elect to attend Boao Forum in China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will attend
the 2008 Boao Forum for Asia to be held April 11-13 in Hainan, China, a
spokesman for the Taiwan delegation to the forum said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-chi said Siew, who has attended the forum in five of the last six years
since the forum started meeting in 2002, will attend the gathering in his
capacity as chairman of the private Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation that
he founded in 2003 to promote the establishment of a common market across the
strait.</P>
      <P>Wang told a news conference at the KMT headquarters that Taiwan's delegation
will host a round-table meeting on Taiwan's economy and on the cross-strait
economic outlook April 13 at the forum.</P>
      <P>Hung Tu, executive director of the Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation, and
Chan Hou-sheng, an advisor to the foundation and a former Council of Labor
Affairs chairman, will accompany Siew to Boao, he added.</P>
      <P>As to whether Siew, who is set to assume his new post as vice president May 20,
will meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao, who will preside over the opening of
the three-day conference, Wang said the matter remains uncertain and that he
will give a briefing to the public once the issue is confirmed.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the two sides will not touch on political issues even if they
meet, because the forum serves solely as a platform on which members exchange
views and opinions on economic topics.</P>
      <P>Siew shrugged off the question of whether he would attend the forum earlier that
day in the central city of Taichung, saying only that the answer will be given
at a news conference in two days.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, who met Siew earlier in the day at a closed-door
meeting, said Siew's participation in the Boao Forum meeting would be conducive
to Taiwan's economy. But he added that he believes Siew will also thoroughly
assess possible negative ripples that could arise from the matter on the
political front.</P>
      <P>If Siew attends the 2008 Boao Forum for Asia next week, he would be Taiwan's
first vice president-elect to land on Chinese soil in history.</P>
      <P>Should Siew meet Chinese President Hu Jintao on the occasion, a Siew-Hu meeting
would mark a new page in cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges after a meeting between
Hu and KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan in Beijing in 2005.</P>
      <P>A Siew-Hu meeting would also serve as an indicator as to whether major
breakthroughs can be made in Taiwan-China ties, analysts said.</P>
      <P>The non-government, non-profit Boao Forum for Asia was set up in 2001, with
China, Japan and the Philippines among its 26 members. From 2002, the forum has
held an annual conference in Boao, and Siew has participated in the meeting
every year since 2003.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Chi-chu said it would be good if Taiwan and China can enhance
two-way exchanges, although she suggested that concrete conclusions might not be
reached in such high-ranking meetings as a result of a stalemate between the two
sides over the past eight years.</P>
      <P>"It would be good enough if the two sides could forge a good climate for greater
cross-strait trade and economic exchanges on the financial front and in the area
of direct trade and transportation links," she said.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming,  the ruling Democratic Progressive  Party's legislative caucus
whip, urged Siew to use the opportunity to underscore Taiwan's desire to join
international organizations such as the World Health Organization, while fully
safeguarding Taiwan's independent sovereignty.</P>

      <P>A civic group called on President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Sunday to pay closer  attention  to matters  regarding  the
environment  and environmental protection once he assumes office.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) said the KMT, which held power
for decades until 2000, is well-known for its economic policies and related
achievements but paid regrettably little attention to affairs pertaining to the
environment.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuang-jung, a TEPU leader and a professor at National Taiwan University,
said TEPU is concerned that Ma, who is set to be inaugurated May 20, will follow
the KMT's old policies regarding the environment after he takes the helm of a
new administration.</P>
      <P>Noting that in the past, Taiwan's economic development was built on highly
polluting  and  high  energy-  and  water-consuming manufacturing industries,
Hsu called on Ma to see to it that Taiwan shifts  to knowledge-based  economy
and "green"  manufacturing industries that are environmentally friendly.</P>
      <P>Hsu also said that Taiwan has been accused of being a major culprit in terms of
carbon dioxide emissions and suggested that Ma should keep in his mind efforts
to cut the country's carbon dioxide emissions and make "concrete schedules" for
such reductions.</P>
      <P>Hsu also suggested that the KMT, which now holds an absolute majority in the
113-seat legislature, should seek to lower the vote threshold for referendums on
major issues concerning environmental protection, such as whether or not new
nuclear power plants should be built.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No conclusion over president-elect's U.S. visit: KMT official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government has not yet decided on whether it will allow President-elect
Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)  to visit Washington ahead
of his inauguration May 20, a KMT official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Representative Chang Ta-tung of the U.S. office of the KMT and its
political ally, the People First Party, told CNA that "we are still negotiating
with the U.S. government over the matter. The atmosphere is very good and our
main purpose focuses on how to further Taiwan-U.S. relations."</P>
      <P>Chang rebutted an April 4 story in the Nelson Report, a Washington insider daily
newsletter,  quoting Christopher Hill, assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs, as having apparently told a journalist during a visit
to Indonesia that Bush had already denied Ma's visa request.</P>
      <P>The story also said that "no-one involved will be surprised when this is
formally announced. So attention has already turned to how the White House plans
to compensate for so obviously catering to Beijing's concerns."</P>
      <P>"Most likely by sending a much higher-level official U.S. delegation to the
inauguration than has been seen before, " the story went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, the story wrote that "Taiwan journalist sources say they've been
told that Chris Hill himself will lead the U.S. delegation, but former
Administration officials here say they think that unlikely, given the self-
imposed U.S. ban on such a high-ranking State Department official visiting
Taiwan in any capacity."</P>
      <P>Casting doubt on the correctness of the story, Chang said that he had read the
story, and as it did not directly quote Hill, was thus "not necessarily
reliable."</P>
      <P>On the same day in Taipei, Ma's spokesman, Lo Chih-chiang, declined to confirm
or deny whether Ma's U.S. visit has been denied.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the story, Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Shieh Jhy-
wey said that if the story is true, then "we will feel very sorry" for Ma and
Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>Shieh further attributed the cause to Beijing's "one China" principle, which
Taiwan refuses to accept on the grounds that the principle downgrades Taiwan
into a part of China's territory.</P>
      <P>At a workshop held a day earlier by the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think
tank, Randy Schriver, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, said that he fully supports Ma visiting Washington
before taking office.</P>
      <P>Schriver, however, doubted if Ma's trip would come about.</P>
      <P>He explained that the U.S. government will refrain from allowing the president-
elect to visit Washington before his inauguration in fear of setting a precedent
that could invite undesired consequences.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government might feel that it would be more appropriate for Ma to come
to the United States when he makes a transit stop on U.S. soil during an
overseas trip after assuming office, Schriver said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Ma should hold a dialogue with Washington through phone calls
or video conferences if he fails to visit the U.S. ahead of his inauguration, or
even use a trip to another country to make a stopover in the U.S. possible.</P>
      <P>Top-ranking official exchanges between Taiwan and the United States have been a
sensitive issue amid the absence of formal diplomatic relations and opposition
from China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Climate change theme of World Health Day 2008</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>To mark World Health Day 2008 April 7, the World Health Organization (WHO) has
designated "protecting health from climate change" as the theme for the year in
order to raise public awareness of the issue and generate action by government
and non government institutions, according to the WHO Web site.</P>
      <P>Climate change has caused negative effects in Taiwan, such as poor crops and the
spread of infectious diseases. Dengue fever, which used to be recorded only in
southern Taiwan, has spread into the central and northern part of the island
since 1995 as a result of the global warming effect, according to the Web site
of the Taiwan Environmental Information Center, a non-government organization.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan suffered a severe water shortage in 2002 because of poor
rainfall that year, which was a consequence of irregular weather patterns caused
by climate change.</P>
      <P>According to the WHO, health is one of the areas most affected by climate
change, especially in the poorest regions of the world, which actually
contribute least to greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>A WHO assessment shows that approximately 600,000 deaths occurred worldwide as a
result of weather-related natural disasters in the 1990s, some 95 percent of
which were in poor countries, a tendency is likely to worsen in the future,
according to the WHO.</P>
      <P>Climate change can effect health because of increasing frequency of heatwaves
and cold spells, more variable precipitation patterns that are likely to
compromise the supply of drinking water and increase the risk of disease.</P>
      <P>With sea levels rising, the risk of coastal flooding is also increased, which
will lead to population displacement, the WHO says, enumerating other natural
disasters stemming from climate change such as extreme temperatures, droughts
and bushfires.</P>
      <P>To illustrate the increasing impact of climate change, the WHO noted that in the
1980s, 1,848 extreme climate events affected 1.3 billion people around the
world, while in the 1990s, about 1.8 billion were affected by 2,078 disaster
events.</P>
      <P>With the aim of stabilizing the effects of climate change on health, the WHO
suggested cross-sector collaboration among government agencies, non-government
organizations, industrial and professional groups and local communities, on
decisions related to urban planning, transport, energy supply, food production,
land use and water resources.</P>
      <P>World Health Day, established in 1950, is celebrated every April 7 under the
sponsorship of the WHO with the aim of promoting awareness of a specific health
theme.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government to raise exporters' awareness of strategic high-tech goods</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will hold a series of presentations from April 8 to raise local
companies' awareness of regulations on the export of strategic high-tech
commodities to help the companies avoid breaking the law and hurting the
country's international image.</P>
      <P>Although the Bureau of Foreign Trade established a mechanism with the U.S.
government in June 2006 for screening applications for exporting strategic high-
tech commodities to North Korea and Iran, there has been an increase in the
number of local companies violating the regulations over the years, the bureau
said in a recent statement.</P>
      <P>Some of the violators have been indicted by local prosecutors on charges of
violating the Foreign Trade Act, the statement went on.</P>
      <P>As part of efforts to solve this problem, the bureau also plans to amend the
control list to exclude less sensitive items, the statement said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the bureau will work with the U.S. government to help Taiwanese
companies set up an internal control system, the statement continued.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the Taiwan government formulated the regulations to
join a global effort to control the transport of strategic high-tech products
and technology to prevent weapons and equipment from spreading illegally.</P>
      <P>The statement explained that it is very easy for Taiwan to become a source for
terrorists seeking to obtain sensitive goods because Taiwan has a well-developed
high-tech industry and it is a transport hub for goods in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, the results of these control measures have attracted the
world's attention, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The presentations will take place at the bureau's office April 8, and at the
offices of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) in the
southern port city of Kaohsiung and in the central city of Taichung April 10 and
15, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier worries about VP-elect's possible meeting with Chinese leader</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 6 (CNA)
04/06/08  20:11:20
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Vice President-elect Vincent Siew of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is
likely to meet Chinese President Hu Jintao at the 2008 Boao Forum next week in
China's Hainan Province, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Sunday that he is
concerned that such a meeting would lack a basis of parity and national dignity.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a TV reporter, Chang said that "it may be an exaggeration to
speculate that Siew will sell out Taiwan, but I do believe that such contact
between Siew and Hu would lack the principles of dignity, self-determination and
parity. "</P>
      <P>The premier argued that "cross-Taiwan Strait contacts must not be made at the
cost of Taiwan's overall interests, " although he said he has "the greatest
expectations for them." He did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-chi, who will serve as the spokesman for Taiwan's delegation at the 2008
Boao Forum meeting, confirmed the same day at KMT headquarters that Siew, in his
capacity as chairman of the Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation, will lead a
delegation to the annual international conference April 11-13, as he has done
for the last several years.</P>
      <P>Siew established the foundation in 2003 to promote the formation of a cross-
strait common market, and has taken part in the annual Boao Forum conference
every year since then.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's delegation, according to the conference agenda, will host a round-table
meeting on Taiwan's  economy  and on the cross-strait economic outlook April 13,
Wang said.</P>
      <P>Hung Tu, executive director of the Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation, and
Chan Hou-sheng, an advisor to the foundation and a former Council of Labor
Affairs chairman, will accompany Siew to Boao, he added.</P>
      <P>As to whether there will be a Siew-Hu meeting during the three-day conference,
Wang said the matter remains uncertain and that he will give a briefing to the
public after it is fixed.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the two sides will not touch on political issues even if they
do meet at the forum, because the forum serves solely as a platform on which
members exchange views and opinions on economic topics.</P>
      <P>However, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey urged Siew to use the Forum to
demand Hu in public to allow Taiwan to enter the World Health Organization (WHO)
as a full member or to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer.</P>
      <P>As the KMT has repeatedly said that Taiwan's security and international space
will be better guaranteed if it returns to power, the issue is set to become the
first major task facing the KMT in terms of cross-strait relations, with the WHA
annual conference slated to be held from May 19-24 in Geneva, Shieh said.</P>
      <P>Siew and President-elect Ma Ying-jeou will be inaugurated May 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Mainstream PC makers eyeing low-price laptop market</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 6 (CNA)
04/06/08  20:20:43
(By Yeh Fang-hsun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eager to replicate the success of Taiwanese PC maker ASUSTek Computer (ASUS) ,
which dominated the market for low-priced laptop computers with its Eee PC in
2007, big-name PC vendors including Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) , Acer and Dell are
all gearing up to bring their own small laptops to market.</P>
      <P>Last October, ASUS launched and sold 350,000 Eee PCs -- a mini notebook that
weighs less than 1 kilogram and has a 17.78 cm screen.</P>
      <P>According to a ASUS official, the US$400 computer helped boost company sales at
the recent Taipei Software Show to 4,800 notebooks.</P>
      <P>ASUS estimates that worldwide sales of the Eee PC throughout 2008 will reach 5
million.</P>
      <P>The Eee PC has spurred many companies to follow ASUS's lead, with local company
Acer among the first to enter the low-price notebook market with its own ultra-
compact, 22.6 cm screen laptop that is scheduled to go on sale this June.</P>
      <P>Acer's mini notebook will be manufactured by Taiwanese PC maker Quanta Computer
in a run of 2 million units, which will be the manufacturer's major notebook
order in the second quarter of 2008.</P>
      <P>Leading PC maker Intel and LCD maker AU Optronics are also beneficiaries of
Acer's bid, receiving orders from Acer to make Central Processing Units (CPUs)
and LCD monitors, respectively, for the low-price notebook.</P>
      <P>Another potential competitor for the Eee PC -- HPQ's Compaq 2133 -- will enter
the market in April. The mini computer will weigh 1.13 kilograms and will be
manufactured by Inventec Corp., market analysts said.</P>
      <P>Intel, following the collaboration with ASUS in creating the Eee PC, developed a
similar product of its own -- the Netbook, or 2go PC. The little laptop,
manufactured by Computer Technology Link (CTL), will be aimed at the education
market.</P>
      <P>Although one step slower than its competitors, Dell's low-price notebook, which
is scheduled to be launched in July, is expected to have a first order of about
1 million units, manufactured by Compal Electronics.</P>
      <P>Dell's move into the market indicates that the world's mainstream PC vendors are
all targeting the low-price market.</P>
      <P>An industry insider said that apart from the low price advantage, another major
factor for the popularity of mini laptops in the local market is their
lightweight portability.</P>
      <P>"Many parents, for example, have bought Eee PCs for their children for
educational use, because small children can easily bring the book-sized little
laptop to school with them, " said the industry insider, who referred to the Eee
PC as an electronic book.</P>
      <P>The mini laptop market is expected to grow at a faster speed than that of home
PCs and regular-sized notebooks, and will help boost notebook market sales to
200 million units by 2010, according to Intel.</P>

      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew of the Kuomintang confirmed Sunday that he
will attend the Boao Forum to be held April 11-13 in Hainan, southern China.</P>
      <P>In an interview with TVBS, Siew said he is a founding member of the forum and
will attend the annual gathering in his capacity as chairman of the Cross-Strait
Common Market Foundation, as he has done in the last five years.</P>
      <P>The organization was founded by Siew in 2001 to promote the establishment of a
common market across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Siew related that he had informed President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of his intention,
and that Ma said he respected his decision since it had to do with the Common
Market Foundation.</P>
      <P>Siew said he had missed the March 13 deadline for applying to participate in the
forum as he was busy with his election campaign during that time, and that he
had explored the possibility of joining the event only after the March 22
election in which he and Ma beat their Democratic Progressive Party rivals Frank
Hsieh and Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Siew said, the organizers of the forum welcomed his participation,
and the paperwork for his participation in the event was almost all set for
Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Barring any unexpected incidents, I will attend the forum." said Siew, who will
be sworn in as vice president on May 20.</P>
      <P>He said that the forum's organizers must have gotten a green light from Beijing
before accepting his application, in light of his sensitive new position as
Taiwan's vice president elect. But "I do not understand the reasons" behind
Beijing's decision, he added.</P>
      <P>The forum will be formally opened by China President Hu Jintao and there is a
possibility that he will meet Siew for the first time since the Taiwan election.</P>
      <P>Siew and Hu have met previously at the forum in 2004.</P>
      <P>Siew refused to predict what results his attendance at the forum might achieve,
saying only that the forum was dedicated to discussing economic issues that
Taiwan would face in the future.</P>
      <P>"I will join the forum as a member and if there are any positive results from my
participation, I would let the people know after I return," Siew said.</P>

      <P>An official of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) called on the Taiwan people
Monday to respect the professionalism of KMT Vice President-elect Vincent Siew
and to trust in his ability.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, executive director of the KMT Central Policy Committee, urged the
public to trust Siew's ability to uphold Taiwan's dignity and rights at the 2008
Boao Forum for Asia, which he will attend April 11-13 in Hainan, China.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-chi, a spokesman for the Taiwan delegation to the forum, confirmed
Sunday that Siew, who was at the forum for five of the last six annual meetings
since it was launched in 2002, will participate this year in his capacity as
chairman of the private Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation was founded by Siew in 2001 to promote the establishment of a
common market across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that some people in Taiwan have been making noises about Siew's
attendance at the forum on grounds that Siew is now the Republic of China vice
president-elect, and that his presence at the international forum -- which is
expected to bring together 11 heads of state -- may provide Beijing with a
chance to further belittle Taiwan in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Noting that Siew and his team are trying hard to score a breakthrough for Taiwan
in the global diplomatic community, Lin said that the KMT will spare no efforts
and will make every possible attempt to assist them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fugitive arms broker, family still absent from Taipei court</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A fugitive arms broker and his family, indicted on charges related to the high-
profile Lafayette kickback case, were still absent from their trial at a Taipei
court Monday, legal sources said.</P>
      <P>Neither Andrew Wang, the French arms supplier Thompson-CSF's agent in Taiwan,
nor his wife and their four children were present at Monday's trial. The six
were indicted by a special judicial panel in September 2006 on charges of
collecting kickbacks from Taiwan's purchase of six Lafayette-class frigates from
France in 1991.</P>
      <P>At the court, Wang's lawyer said Wang temporarily has no plans to return to
Taiwan as he is ill and is also worried that his personal safety may be
jeopardized if returns.</P>
      <P>As to Wang's wife and their four children, the lawyer said, they were absent
because none of them were involved in the kickback case.</P>
      <P>Wang fled the country after Navy Capt. Yin Ching-feng died under suspicious
circumstances in late 1993. Yin is believed to have been poised to blow the
whistle on his colleagues who had allegedly received kickbacks from the
Lafayette deal.</P>
      <P>Wang has been listed by Taiwan authorities as wanted on murder charges since
September 2000.</P>
      <P>Concluding a second-phase investigation into the arms procurement scandal in
September 2006, the Taipei special judicial panel indicted Wang, his wife, and
their four children, as well as Kuo Li-heng, a former naval officer in charge of
arms procurement, and his brother Kuo Wen-tien on charges of collecting
kickbacks from the Lafayette deal.</P>
      <P>The judicial panel also asked for a life sentence for Wang.</P>
      <P>According to the 2006 indictment, the Wangs opened more than 60 bank accounts in
Europe and Asia to launder US$520 million in illicit gains from the deal.</P>
      <P>Wang had also transferred more than US$10 million in kickbacks to Kuo via
several overseas banking accounts, the indictment stated.</P>
      <P>Swiss authorities in June 2007 returned to Taiwan US$34 million in frozen bank
deposits believed to be kickbacks connected to Taiwan's purchase of six
Lafayette-class frigates from France in 1991. Officials at the Swiss Department
of Justice said the funds returned belonged to two different holders, but
declined to identify the holders.</P>
      <P>The funds were handed over to Taiwanese authorities on condition that the legal
proceedings against the two persons comply with human rights principles, the
Swiss officials stipulated.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to seek legal assistance from the Swiss government in 2001 in an
attempt to retrieve the funds frozen in several Swiss banks.</P>
      <P>Through a judicial aid agreement with Switzerland,  Taiwan prosecutors managed
to obtain a collection of bank files from a Swiss federal judge in November
2005. After nearly 10 months of close examination of the files, Taiwan
petitioned in September 2006 for the return of US$520 million from a total of
US$730 million frozen in the Swiss banks.</P>

(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The charge d'affaires to Taiwan of Saint Kitts and Nevis rebutted Monday a
warning by Vice President Annette Lu that diplomatic relations are fragile
because the Caribbean country did not immediately send a congratulatory message
to President-elect Ma Ying-jeou on his poll victory, blaming the delay on
"unfortunate circumstances."</P>
      <P>"We were not able to respond to the result of the election as we normally do due
to a series of unfortunate circumstances, " Saint Kitts and Nevis Charge
d'Affaires Jasmine Huggins told CNA to clarify the issue.</P>
      <P>Lu said in a media interview April 2 that the failure of three Republic of China
allies -- Guatemala, Burkina Faso and St. Kitts and Nevis -- to send
congratulatory messages on Ma's victory was a warning that ties with those
countries could be tenuous.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) acknowledged April 3 that the Foreign
Ministry had yet to receive congratulatory messages from two diplomatic allies
but downplayed the issue, saying that the oversight was due to administrative
delays.</P>
      <P>Huggins noted that she had to hasten home upon the death of her father the day
after the March 22 presidential election and did not come back until last
Thursday. Also, she went on, she had been very sick since her return.</P>
      <P>The charge d'affaires said the embassy did not intend to delay the
congratulatory message and that relations between Taiwan and Saint Kitts and
Nevis remain stable.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's landslide victory March 22 was so welcomed by the
international community that many countries, even some without diplomatic
relations with Taiwan, congratulated Ma because many welcome the prospect of
improvement in cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush also sent a statement right after the election to
congratulate Ma, praising Taiwan as a beacon of democracy in Asia -- a contrast
from the letter sent by his secretary to President Chen Shui-bian which was not
delivered until a week after his re-election in 2004.</P>
      <P>A congratulatory message sent by St. Kitts and Nevis Prime Minister Denzil
Douglas arrived April 4, according to the MOFA.</P>
      <P>Douglas said in his message that the 25-year-old bilateral relations will remain
intact in the wake of the transition of power in Taiwan and that he hopes
bilateral relations will be further deepened and expanded during Ma's term in
office, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan became the first diplomatic ally of Saint Kitts and Nevis after its
independence and the two forged diplomatic ties in 1983. Douglas visited Taiwan
in February to attend the opening ceremony of the country's first embassy in
Asia.</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court recently ordered the Alexander Health Club to pay over
NT$245,000 (US$8,060) in compensation to a university professor who broke his
arm after he slipped on a wet floor at one of the fitness centers.</P>
      <P>The National  Taiwan University  of Science and Technology professor, surnamed
Lin, broke his right forearm at the health club's Songshou Road branch Dec. 17,
2005. Lin ended up spending four days in hospital for treatment of his broken
forearm, which took over two months to heal.</P>
      <P>Lin decided to sue the health club for compensation six months after the
accident, stating in the lawsuit that the health club had not placed any warning
signs to let people know that the floor was wet.</P>
      <P>In the lawsuit, Lin claimed that the muscles in his right forearm were still
weak and that full mobility had not been restored after over six months of
rehabilitation, and that he was seeking NT$1.44 million in compensation for
medical and transportation expenses, loss of income due to his injury, and
emotional suffering.</P>
      <P>The court said in its ruling that the Alexander Health Club was responsible for
the accident and should compensate the plaintiff.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Builders to launch one-day strike</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
04/07/08  16:34:50
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local construction companies engaged in public works projects decided Monday to
launch a one-day strike later this week to protest against what they described
as the outgoing government's lack of action in dealing with their difficulties
stemming from surging costs of building materials.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Regional Engineering Contractors Association (TRECA) , which is
comprised of 11,743 realtors and contractors, plans to launch the strike April
10, TRECA officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they added, some 3,000 people connected to the organization are
expected to launch an appeal on that day to the Cabinet-level  Public
Construction  Commission for a solid and immediate response to a subsidy request
they made last month.</P>
      <P>They said that TRECA Chairman Pan Chun-jung and executives of various contractor
companies paid a courtesy call on Premier Chang Chun-hsung in mid-March in an
attempt to ask the administration to raise the levels of subsidies to help them
overcome the financial difficulties brought on by the surging building material
costs.</P>
      <P>At that  meeting,  they said,  Chang  promised  that  the administration would
make a decision in a week on how and when increased subsidies should be granted.</P>
      <P>However,  they went on, the Public Construction Commission announced after the
March 22 presidential election that such a decision should be made by the
incoming new administration, on the grounds that the amounts involved in the
subsidy plans are too large and that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration will be leaving office.</P>
      <P>DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh lost to his rival from the main
opposition Kuomintang, Ma Ying-jeou, in the March 22 election by some 2.21
million votes.</P>
      <P>TRECA lashed out at the DPP administration, accusing it of eating its words, and
decided to launch the one-day strike in protest.</P>
      <P>The association asked the DPP government in March for NT$6 billion (US$197.37
million) in subsidies to help them cover the rising cost of building materials
that have plagued them over the past year.</P>
      <P>The government currently offers subsidies to contractors when building materials
in general categories rise by 5 percent and in specific categories by 10
percent. The Public Construction Commission in early March tentatively approved
the lowering of both thresholds to 2.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Pan said TRECA had no opinion on the commission's move but hopes that the
subsidies will be applied retroactively from January 2007 -- when the price
hikes actually began -- and continue to the end of 2008.</P>
      <P>Developers and contractors have been hit especially hard by the soaring cost of
steel products used in building. The cost of rebar had surged from NT$8,000
(US$263.16) per ton some four months ago to over NT$28,000 per ton as of Monday
-- an all time high.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from local builders to take action to stem the rise, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Feb. 20 a ban on the export of rebar and
steel billets -- the main material used to produce rebar.</P>
      <P>But even the MOEA acknowledged that the ban, which is expected to last for three
months after it takes effect in two weeks, will not have much of an impact on
local prices because Taiwan does not export big volumes of those products.</P>
      <P>The ministry said it will also closely monitor exports of steel H-beams and
steel scrap for three months to see if action on those items is warranted.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, the average price for steel H-beams had surged to NT$29,300 per
ton, while the average price for steel scrap had soared to NT$16,900 per ton --
both representing record highs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Human rights activists in Taiwan urged Chinese authorities Monday to release
jailed dissident Hu Jia and called for condemnation of China's deteriorating
human right record and a boycott of the Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>"This Olympics absolutely does not reflect justice or human rights,  " said Sun
Yu-lien,  an executive  member of Taiwan International Human Rights Solidarity
Center. "We strongly urge leaders of the Chinese government to fulfill the
promise that China made in order to win the right to host the Olympic Games --
to improve its human rights record."</P>
      <P>Several human rights activists, including a lawyer, a journalist and a
university professor, held a press conference in Taipei to call for China to
release the prominent Chinese human rights dissident Hu Jia on bail for medical
treatment, based on humanitarian concerns.</P>
      <P>Hu, who suffers from cirrhosis of the liver, was sentenced on April 2 to three
and a half years in prison and banned from political activism for one year for
"inciting subversion of state power" by posting articles on the Internet and
giving interviews to foreign journalists. The 34-year-old activist, one of the
most vocal in China, rose to prominence as a campaigner for the rights of AIDS
patients.</P>
      <P>Amid growing criticism worldwide of China's crackdown in Tibet, Hu's case has
drawn much international attention, with critics saying that his detention and
conviction were part of a campaign to silence dissents ahead of the Beijing
Olympics.</P>
      <P>Hu's wife, Zeng Jinyan, who has a newborn baby, has been under house arrest
since her husband was arrested in December last year.</P>
      <P>Yang Chunlin, another human rights activist, was given a maximum sentence of
five years in jail last month on subversion charges after he organized a
campaign to collect 40,000 signatures for a petition that stated: "We want human
rights, not the Olympics."</P>
      <P>Huang Mou, director of the Chang Fo-Chuan Center for the Study of Human Rights
at Soochow University, said that it is incomprehensible why the Chinese
government would expend so much effort on two completely harmless people whose
only concerns are the truth and human rights.</P>
      <P>"What China did has violated every moral standard, " Huang said. "China cannot
expect to be seen as a great civilized country when it is showing disregard for
the universal values of freedom of speech and human rights."</P>
      <P>Chow Fu-mei, an executive member of the Association of Taiwan Journalists, said
that Hu Jia's case is "a trial of the conscience of the 1.3 billion Chinese
people."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will never shrink from any effort to rescue Hu Jia because we believe
that justice will be restored if we try hard enough," she said</P>
      <P>Lin Feng-jeng,  executive  director of the Judicial Reform Foundation, said the
foundation hoped that the press conference would be just a start in a series of
efforts to support those detained and jailed in China.</P>
      <P>"Let's hope today's Taiwan will be tomorrow's China," he said.</P>

      <P>The officials pointed to a case of a woman who was more than 60 years old, who
got cervical cancer even though she had her womb and ovaries taken out 10 years

      <P>"Cervical cancer is not as terrible as women think. On the contrary, it has the
highest cure rate among various cancers if discovered early," the official said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Speed Rail system transported 132,000 passengers and operated a
total of 130 trains Sunday, the last day of Taiwan's Tomb Sweeping holiday,
marking two new highs, an executive of the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Sunday's passenger volume broke the record of 123,000 set on the eve of the
traditional holiday when local people travel to their family homes to pay
tribute to their ancestors and clean up their graves, the executive said.</P>
      <P>Some 460,000 passengers traveled on the system during the four-day holiday, a
figure that exceeded the volume recorded over the Chinese New Year holiday in
February this year, according to the executive.</P>
      <P>The official attributed the increased volume to the THSRC's decision to provide
additional trains and some free seats, a service that drew a lot of impromptu
passengers, adding that during the Chinese New Year holiday most travelers had
reserved seats for planned tours.</P>
      <P>On the last day of the Tomb Sweeping holiday, the THSRC allowed free seating on
some train cars and dispatched an additional four non-reserved trains to carry
people from Kaohsiung to Taipei and one from Taichung to Taipei, but many
passengers still had to stand all the way, the executive said.</P>
      <P>He added that on average, a train with 989 seats was at some points carrying
about 1,500 passengers during peak hours on Sunday, but added that the trains
were not too crowded all the way as many passengers disembarked along the route.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City has established a new center to streamline applications for long-
term care for elderly people living in the capital, the city government
announced Monday, as the proportion of seniors in Taipei is expected to grow.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Long-Term Care Management Center (LTCMC) has been established
with an aim of simplifying the process for the elderly to apply for medical and
social care services, officials said.</P>
      <P>In the past, elderly people in need of services had to file one application to
the Department of Health for medical assessment and another to the Department of
Social Welfare for social services, a welfare department official said at press
conference.</P>
      <P>"The integration of the resources of the two departments is like a wedding,"
joked Allen W. Chiu, the DOH's director, saying that with the establishment of
the center, senior citizens needing long-term care have only one application to
file.</P>
      <P>"Through the collaboration of the two departments, a more efficient service will
benefit elderly citizens in Taipei, " Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin told the news
conference.</P>
      <P>The center also provides  services such as assessment  of individual conditions
and needs, home care, home rehabilitation treatment, and low cost respite care.</P>
      <P>Residents in Taipei aged over 65 -- 55 for indigenous people and 50 for disabled
people -- who are deemed unable to take care of themselves, can file
applications for aid at the center, according to a statement issued by the
center.</P>
      <P>Other people of all ages who are unable to take care of themselves can also
apply for aid, but will receive less governmental subsidies, the center said.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), in 2007, about 2.3 million
people in Taiwan were aged over 65, representing 10.2 percent of the total
population.</P>
      <P>A survey by the Taipei city government showed that in Taipei, 315,618 people,
accounting for 12 percent of the city's population, are aged over 65, and the
growth rate is expected to increase.</P>
      <P>About 30,000 of Taipei's elderly people currently need long-term care services,
the center noted.</P>

      <P>There are no laws or regulations that would ban Vice President-elect Vincent
Siew of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) from attending the 2008 Boao Forum for
Asia in Hainan, China, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun
said Monday.</P>
      <P>"No relevant laws or regulations ban a president-elect or a vice president-elect
from taking part in activities in China before their inauguration," said Liu,
who concurrently serves as MAC spokesman.</P>
      <P>He was responding to concerns raised in recent days about the appropriateness of
Siew's planned trip to the mainland to attend the forum from April 11-13,
especially because he might have a chance to meet Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Siew and president-elect Ma Ying-jeou won the presidential election on March 22,
but will not take up the posts until they are inaugurated on May 20.</P>
      <P>They have pledged to build closer economic ties with China to stimulate growth
in Taiwan's economy and have proposed setting up a "common market" with China.</P>
      <P>The non-government, non-profit Boao Forum, whose 26 members include China, Japan
and the Philippines, aims to promote economic and trade cooperation.</P>
      <P>Siew has attended the forum every year since 2003. The forum, which was set up
in 2001, held its first annual conference in 2002.</P>
      <P>If Siew attends the Boao Forum in his private capacity as chairman of the Cross-
Strait Common Market Foundation before the inauguration, there should be no
legal problem, Liu told reporters.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether Siew has asked the MAC to brief him on the latest
situation across the Taiwan Strait, Liu said the council has not received such a
request from relevant authorities.</P>
      <P>Siew confirmed a media report Sunday that he will take part in the forum as the
chairman of the Cross-Strait  Common Market Foundation. He founded the
foundation in 2001 to promote the idea of setting up a common market between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Siew's attendance at this year's Boao Forum annual conference, however, has
stirred up widespread attention from the domestic political  spectrum,  due  to
his  status  as Taiwan's  vice president-elect and in part because Siew is
likely to meet Hu at the forum.</P>
      <P>Siew's visit will be the first time that a vice president-elect from Taiwan will
land on Chinese soil before his or her inauguration.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-chi, the spokesman of Siew's delegation to the Boao Forum for Asia, told
a news conference Sunday at the KMT headquarters that Hung Tu, executive
director of the Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation, and Chan Hou-sheng, an
adviser to the foundation and a former Council of Labor Affairs chairman, will
accompany Siew to Boao.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the delegation will host a round-table meeting on Taiwan's
economy and on cross-Strait economic outlook on April 13 at the forum.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Taiwan's and China's delegations will not touch on political
issues even if Siew and Hu meet at the forum, because the forum serves solely as
a platform for member countries and areas to exchange views and opinions on
economic topics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC, Taipower welcome `lump sum' price hike plans</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Executives of both state-owned oil refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan and grid operator
Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) expressed welcome Monday to the idea that fuel and
electricity prices will be hiked in June in a "lump sum" way.</P>
      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew is reported to have said recently  that after
the Kuomintang  (KMT)  administration  is inaugurated May 20, he will make sure
the floating oil price system is reviewed and that if necessary, fuel and
electricity prices will be hiked at one time, rather than in several smaller
increments.</P>
      <P>CPC President Pan Wenent and Taipower Chairman Edward Chen expressed welcome to
the "lump sum" price hikes in June, given that it seems impossible for the two
state-owned enterprises to raise their prices any earlier as the outgoing
Democratic Progressive Party administration has decided that prices of gasoline,
electricity and water will not be adjusted before President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's
administration takes the reins of power May 20.</P>
      <P>Pan said that under the "lump sum" price hike formula, the CPC will increase the
average price of its oil products by NT$2.5 per liter.</P>
      <P>He lamented that even if gasoline prices are raised "in one shot" in June, the
hikes will not help CPC's balance sheet look any better for this year.</P>
      <P>He added that as of Monday, CPC had suffered an average loss of NT$330 million
(US$10.86 million) each day, or NT$13 million per hour.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said that if electricity prices are raised in June, he hopes
that the hikes will average about 30 percent.</P>
      <P>He said Taipower would have to implement a price hike averaging 48 percent if
the country's major grid operator wants its costs and revenues to balance by the
end of this year.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, Taipower will not opt for a 48 percent price hike in
consideration that such a drastic increase would cause a negative impact so big
that the country would be "unable to take it."</P>
      <P>He added that when adjusting electricity prices, Taipower will raise prices by
smaller margins for smaller utility users and by larger margins for bigger
users.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The stock exchanges of Taiwan and Poland have signed a Memorandum of Cooperation
(MoC) to allow for reciprocal investment and market operations, Wu Rong-I,
chairman of Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. (TSEC) announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Following the signing of MoCs with Vietnam, Thailand and Abu Dhabi earlier this
year, the TSEC has continued to expand its foreign alliances by inking a
cooperation deal with Poland's Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) , in a bid to explore
the East and Central Europe market, Wu said.</P>
      <P>TSEC, Taiwan Future Exchange (TAIFEX), GreTai Securities Market (GTSM) each
signed a separate agreement with the WSE, he added.</P>
      <P>"The TSEC will take the opportunity to pursue market cooperation to expand its
internationalization," Wu explained.</P>
      <P>He said the TSEC and WSE will hold regular meetings and exchange information on
market operation to prepare for brokerage trade and company listings in both
markets.</P>
      <P>He urged that Taiwan companies invest in the Poland market, following the
example of local brokerage firms Yuanta Securities and Polaris Securities after
the signing last year of the MoC between Taiwan and Singapore. The two
securities, testing the Singapore market, have listed stock warrants and
exchange traded funds (ETF).</P>
      <P>Wu also said that the inking of the MoC between Taiwan and Poland indicated that
European investors are seeking a more lucrative market, adding that a more
diverse range of financial products are to be developed in the future to
accommodate cooperation with the WSE.</P>
      <P>Following the signing, WSE vice president Adam Maciejewski noted that the Polish
stock market has been growing quite rapidly over the last few years and that it
is seeking global opportunities for investment of its capital.</P>
      <P>Through our stock exchange, Taiwan companies are able to expand their businesses
in Europe, especially in Poland,he said.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the exchange model of the Polish initiative, the New Connect
that was launched last October to allow for a Multilateral Trading Facility
(MTF) that helps small companies to list their stocks.</P>
      <P>Maciejewski also said the WSE would like to list Taiwanese companies.</P>
      <P>It (the listing of those companies) would be of great interest to the Polish
capital market,he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Michael Lin, TSEC's senior executive vice president, high-tech
companies like resin maker Chi Mei and PC vendor ASUS are among the targets that
the WSE would like to attract.</P>
      <P>MoC between  stock  exchanges  often provide  new business opportunities for
both markets, said Wu Tang-chieh, Director-General of the Securities and Futures
Bureau under the Financial Supervisory Commission, citing the market alliance of
Taiwan and Poland as a part of a global trend.</P>
      <P>The new relationship between the two countries will benefit both market
operators and all the participants in the financial markets," he added.</P>

      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew confirmed Monday his plan to participate in
the upcoming Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) in China in his capacity as chairman of
the Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation (CSCMF), but he refused to elaborate
on whether he will meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Siew's  participation  in the BFA annual meeting  and the possibility that he
might meet with Hu are considered by the media as an indicator of the prospects
for future cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>At a crowded press conference, Siew avoided directly responding to repeated
questions as to whether he will meet with Hu, saying only that "we respect the
arrangements of the organizer."</P>
      <P>Noting that the CSCMF, a founding member of the Boao Forum, has routinely taken
part in the BFA's annual conference since 2003, Siew said that "we will attend
this year's forum from April 11 as usual."</P>
      <P>However,  he rebutted  concerns  that China might use the opportunity to
describe Siew "the vice leader of the Taiwan area" to belittle Taiwan, saying
that "nothing will be belittled within the Boao Forum."</P>
      <P>He said that what matters in the forum are the discussions and the suggestions
from participants.</P>
      <P>"The Boao Forum serves as a platform for international and cross- strait
exchanges under which everyone is on an equal footing, " he added.</P>
      <P>"We must bear in mind the interest of our nation with a positive attitude," said
Siew, adding that "Taiwan's economy must be connected with the world. With this
positive attitude, we can better understand global issues."</P>
      <P>"We have to be open-minded and focus on the forum itself, and on what will
benefit Taiwan in the future," Siew noted.</P>
      <P>Saying that his plan to take part in the forum was sanctioned by President-
elect Ma Ying-jeou, Siew reaffirmed that "we should never give up any
opportunity that enables Taiwan to be heard by the world."</P>
      <P>In addition to the scheduled forum activities, Siew said he will also preside
over an April 13 roundtable in which the forum participants will exchange views
on Taiwan's economy and cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>"We hope to bring a new beginning to this new era through cross-strait relations
as well as economic exchanges," he said.</P>
      <P>The  BFA  is  a  non-government,  non-profit  international organization set up
with the aim of giving leaders in government, business and academia in Asia and
elsewhere an opportunity to share their visions on the most pressing issues in
the region and in the world at large.</P>
      <P>According to the event organizer, participants in this year's conference include
Siew and Hu, as well as the presidents of Chile, Mongolia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka
and Tanzania.</P>
      <P>Donald  Tseng,  chief executive  of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) and Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive of the Macao SAR, are also expected

      <P>Despite concerns over Vice President-elect Vincent Siew's participation in the
upcoming Boao Forum for Asia (BFA), there are no regulations that would prevent
him from going, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>High-ranking Taiwanese government officials are banned from traveling to China
under Taiwan law, but MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said that Siew will
participate in the non-governmental conference in an "unofficial capacity" and
stressed that "there is no restriction on his (Siew's) visit."</P>
      <P>Siew said Monday that he will attend the forum in China's Hainan province in his
capacity as chairman of the Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation (CSCMF).</P>
      <P>His trip will take on added significance, however, because of his status as vice
president-elect and the possibility that he could meet Chinese President Hu
Jintao at the forum.</P>
      <P>Critics from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party have raised concerns that
China would try to belittle Taiwan and Siew during the April 11-13 event,
although few have argued that he should be stopped from going.</P>
      <P>In keeping with Siew's private status in attending the forum, Liu said the DPP
government would not get involved in the details of the vice president-elect's
trip.</P>
      <P>"His (Siew's) participation in the annual meeting kicking off April 11 will not
be arranged through the government, " Liu said. "We have not received any order
yet to brief Siew on the most up-to- date intelligence on China before his

      <P>The Boao Forum for Asia,  a non-government and non-profit international
organization founded in 2001, serves as a platform for high-level interaction
between Asian and global leaders and aims to promote development goals in Asia

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's lawmakers and the military are looking forward to purchasing 66 F-16
C/D fighters from the United States for the Republic  of China Air Force,
despite  their disagreement over why the proposed deal, reportedly approved by
Washington in 2006, has failed to materialize.</P>
      <P>Deputy Defense Minister Ko Cheng-heng told a meeting of the legislature's
Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee that premature exposure of the
deal and pressure from Beijing are the most likely reasons why the U.S.
government has hesitated in giving the go-ahead for the sale.</P>
      <P>Ko said that an answer obtained from the U.S. State Department about the
proposed armed deal is that the decision is now up to the U.S. president.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang, a co-convener of the committee,
disagreed with Ko's explanation.</P>
      <P>He said the U.S. government was having second thoughts on the deal mainly
because it was displeased with President Chen Shui-bian's obstinacy in pushing a
national referendum on using the name of "Taiwan" to enter the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The legislative committee later unanimously approved a proposal to defreeze a
NT$29.64 million (US$974,140) budget designated for the training of personnel
and other related purposes in preparation for the purchase of the F-16 fighters.</P>
      <P>Last year, the legislature approved an initial conditional budget of NT$20
billion for the F-16 deal, with the funding only allowed to be used when the
U.S. side has agreed to proceed with the sale.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has some 140 F-16 A/B jet fighters, which it bought from the
United States in the 1990s. The Air Force is hoping to acquire 66 F-16 C/D
aircraft --- a more advanced multipurpose jet fighter -- to replace its aging

      <P>More than 100 representatives from five countries are visiting Taiwan to attend
a forum on the culture of Matsu, the Chinese goddess of the sea, as well as a
variety of activities celebrating the goddess' birthday, which falls on April 28
this year.</P>
      <P>The representatives are from 17 temples that worship Matsu from China, Hong
Kong, Macao, Thailand, Singapore, Japan and Australia.</P>
      <P>The Matsu cultural groups, which arrived April 3, attended a international forum
on Matsu culture held April 5 at the Jenn Lann Temple in Dajia, in central
Taiwan's Taichung County. The temple has organized an eight-day pilgrimage in
which devotees carry a Matsu statue around four counties in the region.</P>
      <P>Matsu, who watches over fishermen, is mostly worshipped by people in Taiwan and
in China's coastal areas.</P>
      <P>Matsu's birthday falls on the 23rd day of the third month in the lunar calendar,
and various festival activities are held around this date, although the
pilgrimage of the goddess is the most popular.</P>
      <P>The Matsu cultural delegations also visited the Fusing Temple in Yunlin,
southern Taiwan, Monday, where the Matsu statue stayed twice during its
pilgrimage.</P>
      <P>Yang Wen-chung, president of the Fusing Temple, noted that Matsu followers are
scattered around the world and expressed hope that they can "propagate Matsu's
mercy" wherever they live.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Guoliang, vice chairman of Chinese Mazu (Matsu) Cultural Exchange
Association,  headquartered in China's Fujian Province, hailed the activities
organized by Taiwanese temples and praised the close cultural exchanges across

      <P>As part of their visit, the two will visit a cave in Hualien County that served
as a comfort station during World War II, the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation

      <P>The abandoned cave, which was once a military depot, has already been confirmed

spotlight the rights of comfort women, but the process has not been easy.</P>
      <P>"We have encountered some problems, as the residents want to keep the outside
world from knowing that there was a comfort station in their village, "said
Graceia Lai, the foundation's director of International Affairs.</P>
      <P>She said her group is still making efforts to communicate with the local
residents.</P>
      <P>The Korean visitors said they hope their new museum, to be located in downtown
Seoul, would effectively raise awareness of the comfort women's rights.</P>
      <P>"It will be dedicated to all women who were deprived of their rights during the
war in all countries, " said Song Hanna, the future curator of the new War and
Women's Human Rights Museum.</P>
      <P>Korea's first museum dedicated to women's rights, located one and a half hours
by car outside the capital, only has a collection of documents related to the
comfort women, said Song, who will be in Taiwan until Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lai said that before her foundation builds a real museum in Taiwan, it plans to
first build a virtual museum on the Internet that will expose the crimes
committed against comfort women.</P>
      <P>The foundation estimates that some 1,000 to 1,200 Taiwanese women served as sex
slaves to the Japanese army during World War II, but it said that fewer than 60
have been confirmed as comfort women.</P>
      <P>Two comfort women passed away in March, leaving only 22 in Taiwan to continue
their fight against the Japanese government  for compensation and an
acknowledgement of their status, while in South Korea, 105 comfort women remain
alive.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Aircraft deal legal, money-saver: CAL chairman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines' (CAL's) recent purchase deal for 20 Airbus A350-00 planes is
legal and has saved a great deal of money for the company, CAL Chairman Ringo
Chao said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chao said that "instead of paying NT$10 billion (US$330.9 million) more for the
purchase, I have actually saved around NT$16 billion for the company."</P>
      <P>Chao made the remarks when he was invited to report on CAL's purchase of the
aircraft for around NT$130 billion (US$4.3 billion) to a transportation
committee at the legislature.</P>
      <P>The deal raised concerns that the decision was made in haste, with some critics
noting that former CAL Chairman Philip Wei thought the deal was more expensive
than the highest price CAL would pay and suggested putting the deal on hold when
he was replaced late last year.</P>
      <P>There was also criticism that the down payment on the deal was unreasonably
high when compared with general practice and an investigation unit under the
Supreme Prosecutors Office has conducted a probe into suspected irregularities
in the purchase deal.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yang Li-huan of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , questioned during
the committee meeting why CAL, Taiwan's largest air carrier, paid a down payment
of 3 percent instead of the more usual 1 percent.</P>
      <P>"Even if it is 3 percent, the money should only be paid one year before the
delivery of the aircraft," Wang said, adding that "this is tantamount to a
capitulation in the purchase negotiation."</P>
      <P>In response, Chao said that the higher down payment had solicited more
preferential payment conditions.</P>
      <P>Yang's colleague Huang Chao-hsun also said the Civil Aeronautics Administration
under  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  and Communications approved the deal
Jan. 22 and that CAL signed the deal with Airbus that same afternoon,
questioning if the Presidential Office was pulling the strings behind the deal.</P>
      <P>However, Chao said the company signed the deal Jan. 22 because it wanted to meet
the deadline for Airbus to offer a preferential deal.</P>
      <P>Under the deal, CAL will place an order for the new aircraft to phase out the
six A340-300 passenger jets it currently operates and will maintain an option to
buy an additional six new Airbus aircraft. The planes are still being developed
and will not be delivered until 2015.</P>

    <HEADLINE>March CPI up 3.96% year-on-year</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
04/07/08  21:34:32
(By Yeh Fang-hsun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Led by a 9.33 percent hike in food prices, Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI)
rose to 103.12 in March, representing a 3.96 percent rise compared to the same
month last year, the statistics bureau announced Monday.</P>
      <P>"Although March's CPI was 1.07 percent lower than in February, the CPI for the
first quarter still recorded an average increase of 3.59 percent," said Chao-
Ming Wu, a section chief of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The month-on-month decline in inflation reflected a fall in prices from highs
set during the Chinese New Year holiday, when the prices of overseas travel,
caretakers, and fruits and vegetables usually spike.</P>
      <P>Wu also warned of the 3.07 percent rise year- on-year of core CPI, which
excludes the prices of fruits, vegetables, fish and shellfish.</P>
      <P>"The rise in core CPI was the highest since March 1999, when it went up 3.28
percent, " he said, noting that core CPI's upward climb began accelerating in
the second half of 2007.</P>
      <P>Wu attributed  the surge in prices  primarily  to soaring international
commodity prices, citing the 7.15 percent increase in the wholesale price index
(WPI) for March as a reflection of imported inflation.</P>
      <P>"Excluding the impact of the Taiwan dollar's appreciation, the WPI for imported
commodities valued in U.S. dollars soared by 20.66 percent in March, the highest
since August 1980, when the index rose 27.72 percent because of the second oil
crisis.</P>
      <P>Global increases in prices crude oil, coal, corn, soybeans, wheat and steel were
the main causes of higher wholesale prices, Wu said.</P>
      <P>From early 2006 to March 2008, global wheat prices rose 1.7 times, soybean
prices doubled, and corn prices surged 1.6 times, according to the Chicago Board
of Trade.</P>
      <P>From January 2007 to March 2008, the price of oil exported by the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) increased by 95 percent, from
US$50.80 to US$99.03 per barrel.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS monthly report on price indexes also revealed that fruit,  meat, and
cereals and grains, with year-on-year price increases of 13.45 percent, 12.86
percent and 11.57 percent, rose the most of any food commodities in March.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan is not the only country suffering under the burden of rising
international prices, as in the first two months of 2008 the CPI in the U.S.,
China, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore climbed by 4.2 percent, 7.9 percent,
0.9 percent, 3.7 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged Taiwan's people Monday to begin keeping a close
eye on President-elect Ma Ying-jeou and Vice President-elect Vincent Siew, even
though they will not take office for another six weeks.</P>
      <P>Lu called on the public to immediately begin monitoring the Ma-Siew team --
which will be sworn in on May 20 -- regardless of whether  they voted for the
Ma-Siew ticket of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) or for the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) ticket on March 22.</P>
      <P>The vice president asserted that Ma and Siew simply used "Taiwan" as a tool to
solicit votes, but now that they had won the presidential election, they were
ready to push Taiwan under China's wing without hesitation.</P>
      <P>Lu asked people to ponder whether Ma's offer to use "Chinese Taipei" to apply
for Taiwan's membership at the World Health Organization was a sign that he was
ready to accept Beijing's "one country, two systems" unification scheme.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan risks becoming a special administrative region of China in that case,"
she warned.</P>
      <P>Lu issued the call after attending a memorial service for Cheng Nan-jung, who
self-immolated in 1989 as a protest against KMT rule and its abuse of human
rights in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The vice president made her comments a day after that Siew confirmed he would
attend the 2008 Boao Forum for Asia in China's Hainan province from April 11-13
in his private capacity as the chairman of the Cross-Straits Common Market
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Siew's  visit,  which  will mark  the first  time a vice president-elect from
Taiwan has set foot on Chinese soil, has drawn widespread attention because he
could meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao, who will also be in attendance.</P>
      <P>Like Vice President Lu, DPP legislators appear skeptical over the future KMT
administration's efforts to reach out to China and contended Monday that Siew's
trip could also negatively impact Taiwan's sovereingty.</P>
      <P>At a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, DPP legislative caucus whip
William Lai argued that China would definitely use the Boao Forum to suppress
Taiwan and downgrade it to the status of a province of China and said he doubted
Siew would chalk up any concrete gains at the meeting.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Tsai Huang-liang prodded Siew to ask Hu to clarify China's stance
on the existence of the contentious "1992 Consensus, " a formula in which China
and Taiwan accept that there is only one China, but with different
interpretations of what that China is.</P>
      <P>The DPP has denied the existence of the so-called  "1992 consensus" and sees it
as trap that will allow Beijing to swallow up Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But the KMT maintains that the "1992 consensus" can help set aside the dispute
over Taiwan's sovereignty and pave the way for negotiations on economic and
political issues between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Siew said at a press conference Monday that economic rather than political
issues would be the focus of attention at the forum, which aims to promote trade
and economic cooperation in the region.</P>

      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew should express concern over China's
suppression of Taiwan's international space and jailed Chinese dissidents when
he meets Chinese President Hu Jintao at an economic forum later this week, local
human rights groups said in a statement Monday.</P>
      <P>The statement was issued one day after Siew confirmed that he will attend the
Boao Forum for Asia to be held in Hainan province in southern China April 11-13.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that he will take part in the annual gathering in his capacity as
chairman of the Taipei-based Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation, as he has
done the past five years.</P>
      <P>In the joint statement, Lin Feng-jeng, executive director of the Judicial Reform
Foundation, said that Taiwan "should not be absent" from the growing support in
the United States and Europe for Hu Jia, an environmentalist and a campaigner
for AIDS patients' rights who began serving a three-and-a-half year sentence for
subversion on April 3.</P>
      <P>Lin said that a greater wave of opposition will force Beijing to soften its
hardline stance in cracking down on Chinese dissidents.</P>
      <P>The groups also blasted the Chinese government for failing to keep its promise
to improve its human rights record when it bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games in
2001.</P>
      <P>The group cited Yang Chunlin, a farmers' rights activist who was sentenced to
five years in prison March 24 on the same charge as Hu Jia's, as another example
of China's failure to improve its human rights situation since winning the
Olympic bid.</P>
      <P>The statement called on the world to boycott the Games to be held in Beijing in
August to force China to realize that protecting human rights is the
government's responsibility.</P>
      <P>The rights groups also said in the statement that the two jailed activists'
criticism of the Communist Party of China should not constitute a crime and
supported their court appeals.</P>
      <P>They strongly urged Beijing to allow Hu Jia, who suffers from cirrhosis of the
liver, to be released for medical treatment based on humanitarian concerns.</P>
      <P>Joining in issuing the statement were representatives from the Chang Fo-Chuan
Center for the Study of Human Rights at Soochow University, the Deng Liberty
Foundation, the Taipei Bar Association's Human Rights Protection Committee,  the
Association  of Taiwan Journalists, the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, and
the Taiwan Labor Front.</P>

      <P>Three Taiwanese bakers who won a silver medal at the 2008 Bakery World Cup in
Paris said Monday they are eager to share their experience with newcomers in the
field.</P>
      <P>Participating in the competition for the first time, Taiwan sent a team composed
of Wu Chun-pao, Tsao Chin-hsiung and Wen Shih-cheng to Paris for the March
31-April 2 event, and the threesome finished second to France after defeating
teams from 10 other countries.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu and Tsao each won individual prizes in the European style and
artistic baking categories, which qualifies them for the first international
competition for individual bakers to be held in 2010.</P>
      <P>During a reception held by the Taiwan Flour Mills Association Monday, the trio
said they were especially excited when they won the silver medal because they
were the first Taiwanese to have ever competed in the event.</P>
      <P>"We were very touched when our national flag waved at the venue of the
competition, and we hope that more Taiwanese will follow suit," Wen said.</P>
      <P>Wu said he wants to serve as a baking instructor to help Taiwan's baking
industry surpass the levels of the United States and Japan within five or 10
years and hope that more seminars will be held in which they can hand down their

    <HEADLINE>CEPD suggests incremental price hikes for fuel and electricity</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fuel and electricity prices should be hiked incrementally instead of in one lump
sum, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"We didn't advocate that gasoline and electricity prices should not be adjusted.
We favored a hike after consumer prices become more stable, " said CEPD
Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh at a hearing held by the Legislative Yuan's Economics and
Energy Committee on fuel and electricity price increases and their impact on the
economy.</P>
      <P>Price increases should be discussed after inflation in April eases, she said,
adding that "those hikes should be phased in separately and incrementally
instead of in one lump sum."</P>
      <P>She indicated that the council has estimated that if both fuel and electricity
prices rose in May, the consumer price index (CPI) would increase by more than 1
percentage point.</P>
      <P>Ho also argued that gasoline prices should be adjusted before electricity rates
because a higher cost of electricity would have wider repercussions and could
easily spur across-the-board increases in consumer prices.</P>
      <P>She backed the establishment of an open and transparent price adjustment
mechanism and suggested price hikes should only take effect three months after
they have been announced  to allow businesses time to adjust their production
structure and operational performance.</P>
      <P>The CEPD also suggested that if fuel and electricity prices are raised,
complementary measures should be adopted to take care of the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>Options for such measures include adjusting rates for basic electricity
consumption,  offering  preferential  gasoline  and electricity rates to public
transportation operators, and providing preferential fuel rates for middle- and
low-income households, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Hsieh Fa-ta said that according to an analysis by
Taiwan's statistics bureau and Academia Sinica, Taiwan's leading academic
institution, a 10 percent increase in gasoline prices would lead to increases in
the wholesale and consumer price indexes of 0.46 percentage points and 0.33
percentage points, respectively, as well as a 0.27 percentage point decline in
gross domestic product.</P>
      <P>The same study found that a 10 percent rise in electricity rates would boost
inflation by 0.22 percentage points and cause economic growth to fall by 0.14
percentage points.</P>
      <P>Both state-owned CPC Corp., Taiwan,  and Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) welcomed
Monday the idea that fuel and electricity prices would be increased in June in
one go.</P>
      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew said that after the new administration is
inaugurated, fuel and electricity pricing will revert to a market mechanism,
instead of remaining subject to existing price controls.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) confirmed on Monday a new
indigenous dengue fever case reported four days ago in the southern city of
Tainan, according to the top local health official.</P>
      <P>Hu Shu-chen, director of the Tainan City government's Bureau of Public Health,
cited a laboratory test report by the Centers of Disease Control under the DOH
in confirming that the virus causing the new dengue fever case was the same as
the one that triggered the dengue epidemic last year -- the worst outbreak the
city has ever experienced.</P>
      <P>Tainan recorded over 1,500 confirmed dengue fever cases between mid-June 2007
and late January this year. The epidemic became so bad in August last year that
Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair sacked Su Chun-jen, then director of the city
government's Bureau of Public Health, and appointed Hu, an associate professor
at National Cheng Kung University, to take his place.</P>
      <P>Hu obtained the assistance of servicemen in launching a chemical spray campaign
to kill mosquito larva within the city, but the campaign apparently has failed
to exterminate all virus-carrying mosquitoes.</P>
      <P>The new dengue patient is a 52-year-old woman who showed dengue symptoms in late
March. The case was reported to health authorities April 3.</P>
      <P>She is the third confirmed dengue case this year, following two previous cases
confirmed in late January.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever is an acute viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. Its incubation
period is three to 14 days. Typical symptoms include high fever, severe
headache, skin rashes and muscle and joint pain, accompanied by nausea, vomiting
and loss of appetite.</P>

      <P>The Tainan Public Prosecutors Office on Monday appealed a Tainan District Court
ruling handed down last month to acquit a 72-year-old man charged with sexually
assaulting four foreign foreign workers between 2003 and 2005.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors asked for a 15-year sentence for Hung Ching-chang for coercing
four Vietnamese women into having sex with him. But in a ruling on March 5, the
Tainan District Court found the defendant not guilty on grounds of insufficient
evidence because the alleged victims, who had all returned to their native
country, were not able to testify in court.</P>
      <P>The court, however, sentenced his 50-year-old son Hung Ming-yu, an employment
broker, to 20 years in prison for sexually assaulting 18 Vietnamese women who
came to Taiwan to work as caretakers. The court ordered that the son must also
receive mandatory treatment for three years before serving his sentence.</P>
      <P>According to prosecutors,  the father and son coerced the Vietnamese women into
having sex with them by threatening to send them back to their home country if
they dared to disobey.</P>
      <P>The Hungs offered money to coax some of the victims into out-of-court
settlements afterwards and used threats to obtain written agreements from other
victims to prove that the women had settled all questions with them voluntarily.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors' office in Tainan said it found the lower court ruling
unacceptable and thus decided to appeal the case to the Taiwan High Court.</P>

      <P>Acting Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Frank Hsieh said Monday that
two party members have told him they want to contend for the leadership of the
party in a May 18 election but did not say who they were.</P>
      <P>One of the candidates is believed to be 73-year-old  DPP Legislator Trong Chai,
who failed in a previous bid to chair the party after the DPP suffered a major
defeat in the 2005 city and county elections, according to party sources.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said after a Central Standing Committee meeting held Monday that he
did not oppose the idea of choosing the party's chairman through a coordination
process but indicated there needed to be candidates first.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the committee decided to hold the election for chairman May
18, rather than May 25 as originally planned, to coincide with other elections
to select party representatives and heads of the party's local chapters.</P>
      <P>In addition, the committee approved Hsieh's proposal to allow party members who
are under the age of 35 and those who became DPP members prior to April 25 to
vote in the election.</P>
      <P>Hsieh explained at the meeting that the proposal was aimed at winning young
people's support of the ruling DPP, which suffered a humiliating 17-percentage-
point defeat to the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in the March 22 presidential
poll.</P>
      <P>Hsieh -- the DPP's standard bearer in the election, who first resigned as
chairman but later agreed to stay on to promote party reforms ahead of the
upcoming chairman election -- predicted that only 3,000 or 4,000 young people
would join the party, a number not large enough to influence the election to
favor a certain candidate.</P>
      <P>The DPP currently has some 256,000 valid members, according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said at the meeting, however, that handing young
people the right to vote would not make them like the DPP.</P>
      <P>The party should carefully reconsider the proposal because if the party changed
the rules just for young members, it would be unfair for senior party members,
she said, while stressing at the same time that she did not oppose the proposal.</P>
      <P>Other members, including Kuan Bi-ling, Wu Ping-jui and Lin Si-yao, backed Hsieh
and described opening up the party to young people as the right path of
development.</P>
      <P>Wu,  however, called for a strict screening of membership applications due to
concerns about "nominal" party members who might influence the result of the
election.</P>
      <P>Nominal members serve as proxies for factional  bosses or individual politicians
who want to boost their vote counts or increase their influence within the
party.</P>
      <P>The registration period for the election will be from April 14 to April 18. The
new DPP head will be sworn in May 21.</P>

      <P>Ma paid visits to Hon Hai Group leader Terry Gou and Formosa Plastics Group
(FPG) founder Wang Yung-ching in the afternoon and then had dinner with them,
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) Chairman Morris Chang and Chinese
National Federation of Industries (CNFI) Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung.</P>
      <P>"Between now and the inauguration on May 20, I hope to make good use of the time
to learn more about the problems and expectations of businesses," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He pledged to adopt a more pragmatic policy, more liberalized cross-strait trade
and economic relations, and better cooperation between government and private
sectors to make Taiwan a design and innovation center.</P>
      <P>He also said he hoped to see Taiwan turn into the linchpin of Asian and Pacific
trade and the business headquarters of Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>Ma earlier promised that FPG's Mailiao harbor in western Taiwan will serve as a
port for direct cross-strait shipping links and that Anping Harbor in Tainan
could also be included  as a direct cross-strait shipping port to give local
businesses better access to sources of raw materials and markets.</P>
      <P>"This will not only benefit industrial production, but will also help
agricultural product exports to China," Ma continued.</P>
      <P>Asked if he needed any assistance in setting up a steel plant or naphtha cracker
complex in China, Wang said there was no need to go to China now.</P>
      <P>FPG officials said Wang meant that if direct cross-strait transportation links
are established,  there will be room for development on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, meaning there is no longer an urgent need to invest in China.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai's Gou said that Ma knows he has made software investments in India and
Nanjing, China, and indicated the president-elect urged him to invest in a
software industrial park in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma asked him "to take action before the May 20 inauguration, " Gou
said that he would be happy to comply with Ma's wishes.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung has the potential to become the creative center of digital content in
Asia, as the city has quick access to world information, Gou said.</P>
      <P>The Hon Hai head also said that some of the products in his Vietnamese plants
are currently shipped to the United States through Singapore or Hong Kong, and
he disclosed that he would also take Ma's advice to tranship it via Kaohsiung to
help balance development between northern and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CNFI head Chen suggested to Ma that clear guidelines should be set up for
environmental assessment studies so that if businesses were willing to abide by
the rules, "environmental concerns would not hinder economic development."</P>
      <P>Chen also called for a leaner government, improvement of the investment
environment, tax cuts, and reasonable conditions for Chinese capital coming to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said he was sure that under those circumstances, many Taiwanese businesses
would be willing to return to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP urges public to begin scrutinizing Ma-Siew team</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 7 (CNA)
04/08/08  11:10:19
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged Taiwan's people Monday to begin keeping a close
eye on President-elect Ma Ying-jeou and Vice President-elect Vincent Siew, even
though they will not take office for another six weeks.</P>
      <P>Lu called on the public to immediately begin monitoring the Ma-Siew team --
which will be sworn in on May 20 -- regardless of whether  they voted for the
Ma-Siew ticket of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) or for the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) ticket on March 22.</P>
      <P>The vice president asserted that Ma and Siew simply used "Taiwan" as a tool to
solicit votes, but now that they had won the presidential election, they were
ready to push Taiwan under China's wing without hesitation.</P>
      <P>Lu asked people to ponder whether Ma's offer to use "Chinese Taipei" to apply
for Taiwan's membership at the World Health Organization was a sign that he was
ready to accept Beijing's "one country, two systems" unification scheme.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan risks becoming a special administrative region of China in that case,"
she warned.</P>
      <P>Lu issued the call after attending a memorial service for Cheng Nan-jung, who
self-immolated in 1989 as a protest against KMT rule and its abuse of human
rights in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The vice president made her comments a day after that Siew confirmed he would
attend the 2008 Boao Forum for Asia in China's Hainan province from April 11-13
in his private capacity as the chairman of the Cross-Straits Common Market
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Siew's  visit,  which  will mark  the first  time a vice president-elect from
Taiwan has set foot on Chinese soil, has drawn widespread attention because he
could meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao, who will also be in attendance.</P>
      <P>Like Vice President Lu, DPP legislators appear skeptical over the future KMT
administration's efforts to reach out to China and contended Monday that Siew's
trip could also negatively impact Taiwan's sovereingty.</P>
      <P>At a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, DPP legislative caucus whip
William Lai argued that China would definitely use the Boao Forum to suppress
Taiwan and downgrade it to the status of a province of China and said he doubted
Siew would chalk up any concrete gains at the meeting.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Tsai Huang-liang prodded Siew to ask Hu to clarify China's stance
on the existence of the contentious "1992 Consensus, " a formula in which China
and Taiwan accept that there is only one China, but with different
interpretations of what that China is.</P>
      <P>The DPP has denied the existence of the so-called  "1992 consensus" and sees it
as trap that will allow Beijing to swallow up Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But the KMT maintains that the "1992 consensus" can help set aside the dispute
over Taiwan's sovereignty and pave the way for negotiations on economic and
political issues between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Siew said at a press conference Monday that economic rather than political
issues would be the focus of attention at the forum, which aims to promote trade
and economic cooperation in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two DPP members plan to seek chairmanship: chairman</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
04/08/08  11:11:33

    <TEXT>
      <P>Acting Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Frank Hsieh said Monday that
two party members have told him they want to contend for the leadership of the
party in a May 18 election but did not say who they were.</P>
      <P>One of the candidates is believed to be 73-year-old  DPP Legislator Trong Chai,
who failed in a previous bid to chair the party after the DPP suffered a major
defeat in the 2005 city and county elections, according to party sources.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said after a Central Standing Committee meeting held Monday that he
did not oppose the idea of choosing the party's chairman through a coordination
process but indicated there needed to be candidates first.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the committee decided to hold the election for chairman May
18, rather than May 25 as originally planned, to coincide with other elections
to select party representatives and heads of the party's local chapters.</P>
      <P>In addition, the committee approved Hsieh's proposal to allow party members who
are under the age of 35 and those who became DPP members prior to April 25 to
vote in the election.</P>
      <P>Hsieh explained at the meeting that the proposal was aimed at winning young
people's support of the ruling DPP, which suffered a humiliating 17-percentage-
point defeat to the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in the March 22 presidential
poll.</P>
      <P>Hsieh -- the DPP's standard bearer in the election, who first resigned as
chairman but later agreed to stay on to promote party reforms ahead of the
upcoming chairman election -- predicted that only 3,000 or 4,000 young people
would join the party, a number not large enough to influence the election to
favor a certain candidate.</P>
      <P>The DPP currently has some 256,000 valid members, according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said at the meeting, however, that handing young
people the right to vote would not make them like the DPP.</P>
      <P>The party should carefully reconsider the proposal because if the party changed
the rules just for young members, it would be unfair for senior party members,
she said, while stressing at the same time that she did not oppose the proposal.</P>
      <P>Other members, including Kuan Bi-ling, Wu Ping-jui and Lin Si-yao, backed Hsieh
and described opening up the party to young people as the right path of
development.</P>
      <P>Wu,  however, called for a strict screening of membership applications due to
concerns about "nominal" party members who might influence the result of the
election.</P>
      <P>Nominal members serve as proxies for factional  bosses or individual politicians
who want to boost their vote counts or increase their influence within the
party.</P>
      <P>The registration period for the election will be from April 14 to April 18. The
new DPP head will be sworn in May 21.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will invite President Chen Shui-
bian, Vice President Annette Lu and former party heads to attend the last of the
eight meetings designed to review its decisive defeat in the March 22
presidential poll, party sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>The DPP lost the election to the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) by 17 percentage
points or 2.2 million votes.</P>
      <P>At the first  four meetings,  to be held at the party's headquarters every
evening from Monday, the DPP will listen to scholars, social activists and media
representatives for their ideas on whether the party followed its values when it
ran the government, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>At the meetings, the DPP will also learn about how the party should chart its
development and the local and foreign challenges it faces, the sources said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the DPP will organize another three meetings with its party members
in Kaohsiung, Taichung and Taipei in southern, central and northern Taiwan,
April 12-13, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The final meeting, slated to take place in Taipei City April 19, will be
attended mainly by DPP members who also hold posts in the government.</P>
      <P>Any conclusion reached at the meetings that will require an amendment to the
party's charter will be sent to the Central Standing Committee and a
representative party congress for approval, which the sources said will formally
put the reforms in motion.</P>
      <P>The DPP plans to call a provisional representative party congress May 4,
according to the sources.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office on Tuesday said it regretted that President-elect Ma
Ying-jeou couldn't take part in this year's computerized warfare simulation to
learn more about the operation of the nation's security system.</P>
      <P>The officials were responding to Ma's decision, announced through spokesman Lo
Chih-chiang, to decline an invitation from the Presidential Office to observe
the computer war games because of a "tight schedule. "</P>
      <P>Ma has been busy traveling around Taiwan to thank supporters and visit business
leaders and political figures after winning the March 22 election.</P>
      <P>The president-elect has "missed an opportunity to learn the comprehensive
operations of the national security system, " a Presidential Office official
said, but added, "the computerized war games won't be affected by Ma's absence,
it will continue as scheduled."</P>
      <P>Media reports said recently that the National Security Council has mapped out
the annual computerized warfare simulation.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, President Chen Shui-bian will go to a command center in suburban
Taipei, while Vice President Annette Lu will go to another command center and
conduct the simulated war games via videoconference between April 25-27.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the office has begun the process of handing over power
to Ma, starting with a meeting between President Chen and the president-elect on
April 1 to brief him on classified information related to national defense,
cross-strait relations and diplomatic issues.</P>
      <P>On April 3, Presidential Office Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen also met with
Chan Chuen-po, convener of Ma's transition team.</P>
      <P>The officials said that during the first transition of power between the two
parties in 2000, most of the contact between incoming and outgoing officials
were largely ceremonial  and concerned primarily with the presidential
inauguration.</P>
      <P>But the transition in 2008 has involved briefings in a wide range of areas, with
not only President Chen briefing Ma on diplomatic secrets, but also Tan Sun Chen
meeting with officials from Ma's camp.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office will work with Ma's team to "provide the necessary
assistance should needs arise," the officials said.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) officially announced on Tuesday that Chinese
spouses of Taiwanese citizens with children below age 20 will be allowed to work

    <HEADLINE>Internet shoppers face a lack of information: survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
04/08/08  16:07:26
(By Yeh Fang-hsun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The lack of company and product information found on online shopping sites
violates the Consumer Protection Law and could jeopardize the interests of
buyers, said Cheng Jen-hung, the chairman of the Consumers' Foundation, Chinese
Taipei (CFCT) , Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to a recent foundation survey of 15 Internet stores, 93 percent of the
online vendors failed to provide basic company information, such as the
company's address or customer service contact information, making it difficult
for consumers to get in touch with the company for after-sales services such as
product returns.</P>
      <P>"Article 19 of the Consumer Protection Law (CPL) empowers online buyers to
return products within seven days without having to state the reason or pay any
extra charges, including shipping costs, for the return," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>But 33 percent of the shops surveyed required buyers to pay for shipping when
returning goods, a clear violation of the law, he said.</P>
      <P>"The foundation calls on the authorities concerned, including the Consumer
Protection Commission and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to take prompt
action to protect the rights of online consumers," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the commission could order stores to fulfill their legal
obligations and regularly monitor online retailers.</P>
      <P>Cheng also said consumers needed to gain greater awareness of their rights
before making purchases over the Internet.</P>
      <P>"Consumers should make sure of the validity of contract terms before rushing
through a deal," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The foundation  warned that lingering suspicions  over the transparency of
online shopping sites could eventually affect their ability to survive.</P>
      <P>"The survey showed that 100 percent of shops fail to abide by clauses in Article
19 that require them to clearly inform consumers about the right to cancel
contracts and demand product returns, " foundation vice chairman Hsieh Tien-jen
said, noting that such inaction could backfire.</P>
      <P>Compared  with TV shopping  networks,  which  offer 10-day unconditional return
periods, online stores would face greater challenge if they did not handle
service issues properly, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Another area where service could be improved, he said, is dropping the
requirement that consumers pay for merchandise before it's delivered, as was the
case at nine of the 15 stores surveyed.</P>
      <P>Hsieh believed the shops should deliver the goods before making their customers
pay, even if it was not mandated by law.</P>
      <P>The need for better service would only accentuate the advantages of online
shopping, which offers greater variety than TV shopping networks that can only
showcase one product at a time.</P>
      <P>"With such an advantage, a more complete information system would help boost the
business of online commerce even more," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said Tuesday that it has "followed
precedents" in arranging for Taiwan's outgoing president to pay a visit to the
military before leaving office.</P>
      <P>MND spokeswoman Lisa Chi made the remarks after the Apple Daily, a local
tabloid, reported the same day that the ministry has arranged for President Chen
Shui-bian to visit military installations in his capacity as the nation's
commander-in-chief prior to stepping down on May 20 at a cost of up to NT$100
million (US$3.29 million).</P>
      <P>Some military officials said it would cost NT$10 million alone for the fuel
costs to have military vessels return to Zuoying Naval Base from where they are
stationed to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>Added to that would be expenses for fuel and equipment for the army, air,
logistics, military police and reserve command, according to reports.</P>
      <P>Chi said the ministry has followed precedent in arranging Chen's visit and that
the president went out of his way to ask that there be "no pomp" in arranging
the trip.</P>
      <P>"The ministry has made the trip into a visit of the troops and the expenses will
be funded from their training costs, " Chi said, denying that the ministry has
arranged for any type of ceremonial review or squandered a large amount of
money.</P>
      <P>Chi stressed that the president is the commander-in-chief under the
Constitution, and his review of military forces is a routine and normal
operation.</P>
      <P>The visit will follow military protocol and be conducted in a simple and warm
manner with "etiquette and decorum" befitting a president but will not interrupt
normal military operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged parties across
the political spectrum and the public to show the "necessary respect for the
outgoing and incoming presidents."</P>
      <P>Legislator Sun Ta-chien of the opposition Kuomintang said that in view of the
dire financial straits of the nation, he hopes the visit will be conducted in a
"simple but solemn way to lessen the burden on the MND and national coffers."</P>

      <P>A National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) delegation will leave Thursday
for Kisumu, Kenya's third largest city, to assist that country in building a
model mechanism for disaster prevention and emergency medical care, a hospital
spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>During its planned four-week stay in Kisumu, the group will help local Great
Lakes University Kisumu (GLUK) organize and train second- and third-degree
health care units, introducing the training methods used by Taiwan's own
national disaster medical assistance team to the university, the spokesman
noted.</P>
      <P>The group of medical experts from the Tainan City-based hospital will hold two
different training courses in Kisumu.</P>
      <P>A week-long program will train local medical and health care personnel on how to
command a national disaster medical assistance team, while six day-long training
workshops will cover other topics.</P>
      <P>The group will also donate NT$1 million (US$32,700) worth of disaster rescue
equipment to the Kenyan university, assistance that will include large-sized
tents for emergency medical treatment, first-aid kits, communication devices and
computers, the university spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to the university, Taiwan began medical and health care exchanges with
Kenya two years ago when that country was affected by an outbreak of rift valley
fever, an acute, fever-causing viral disease that affects domestic animals and
humans.</P>
      <P>In April 2007, GLUK Deputy President Dan Kaseje visited Taiwan, and three months
later, Tsai Ming-che, head of the NCKUH Department of Emergency Medicine,
visited the Kenyan university, where he helped set up the program to establish
the model disaster prevention mechanism.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP-elect has plenty to gain, and lose, at Boao Forum for Asia</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
04/08/08  16:52:42

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew will be walking a fine line when he attends an
economic forum in China this weekend, an occasion many believe could set the
stage for improved ties between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Siew's every move will be watched under a microscope at the April 11-13 Boao
Forum for Asia. If he proves adept at personal diplomacy and skillfully
navigates meetings with Chinese officials, including with Chinese President Hu
Jintao, he could score a breakthrough in the lingering cross-Taiwan Strait
impasse.</P>
      <P>But should Siew appear to be marginalized or find himself unable to defend the
country if China attempts to belittle Taiwan, then he will have fallen prey to
what critics call Beijing's "unification trap," political analysts said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Siew announced at a news conference Monday that he will attend the forum in
southern China's Hainan province in a private capacity as the chairman of the
Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation.</P>
      <P>Noting that the forum is a platform for exchanges of visions on international
and cross-strait trade and economic development, Siew said he will convey
Taiwan's good will and sincerity to China in hopes of enhancing mutual trust.</P>
      <P>He insisted that economic issues will dominate the forum and ruled out any
possibility of touching on politically sensitive questions in discussions with
Chinese officials.</P>
      <P>The vice president-elect's focus dovetails with President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's
campaign promises of working for closer cross-strait economic ties and faster
domestic economic growth.</P>
      <P>But it remains to be seen what, if anything, Siew can really accomplish in three
days, or if he even needs to bring home any tangible results for his mission to
be proclaimed a success.</P>
      <P>More optimistic observers believe that the man known as "smiling Siew, " who
showed a knack for diplomacy and was a skilled trade negotiator while serving as
economics minister and premier under the previous Kuomintang (KMT)
administration, will be in a strong position so long as he can successfully
foster an impression of "ice-breaking" by reaching out to Hu during the
conference.</P>
      <P>But skeptical lawmakers and officials  from the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) administration are worried that the presence of Taiwan's vice president-
elect at an international meeting in China might lead to an undesirable outcome.</P>
      <P>They are particularly wary that China could manipulate the event to claim its
sovereignty over Taiwan and belittle Siew by portraying him as the deputy
leader  of the Taiwan area under China's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>"Siew should bear in mind that his status as vice president-elect is far more
important than his capacity as chairman of the private Cross-Straits Common
Market Foundation and should not let China use the occasion to downgrade Taiwan
to a local government under its control, " Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-
wey warned Monday at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Like many in the DPP, Shieh urged Siew to go beyond economic issues at the Boao
forum and seize the opportunity to persuade China not to impede Taiwan's bid for
observer status in the World Health Assembly  --  the decision-making  body  of
the World  Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Shieh's proposal, political analysts said Shieh is setting the bar
too high, given the fact that the Boao forum is just a non-governmental  conduit
for discussion on economic issues. Moreover, they said, the DPP administration
has not authorized Siew to negotiate such a politically sensitive issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Executive  Yuan Secretary-General  Chen Chin-jun contended that
Siew's emphasis on his private capacity in attending the forum could make him a
"laughing stock" in the international community.</P>
      <P>"Siew should not ignore the fact that his status has changed significantly
following his election as our country's next vice president," Chen cautioned.</P>
      <P>While stressing that the government supports participation in international
conferences and activities, Chen said three principles -- dignity, parity and
reciprocity -- could not be compromised at these occasions.</P>
      <P>"As the vice president-elect,  Siew should  bear  in mind Taiwan-centric
identity and the common well-being of Taiwan's people as his guiding principles
and keep the content of the upcoming forum transparent and open for media
supervision," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Some political analysts believe the most important thing Siew can do at the
forum is to help Chinese President Hu Jintao better understand President-elect
Ma Ying-jeou, who will be sworn in as president May 20.</P>
      <P>According to them, Chinese leaders are now sizing up Ma, who advocated "no
independence," "no unification, " and "no use of force" in the Taiwan Strait
during his election campaign.</P>
      <P>At the same time, however, he did not reiterate that the KMT's ultimate goal for
Taiwan was "eventual unification" with China, which analysts said has made
Beijing suspect that Ma has abandoned the concept as a pillar of his China
policy.</P>
      <P>Should China confirm that suspicion, they said, the prospects for substantial
improvement in cross-strait ties could be dimmed.</P>

      <P>Jhonghe Mayor Chiu Chuei-yi on Tuesday invited people around the country to come
enjoy the Burmese New Year's festival to be staged in his city in Taipei County
on April 20.</P>
      <P>Chiu issued the invitation while paying a visit to Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-
wei at the county government.</P>
      <P>Burma's New Year's festival, called Thingyan, is celebrated over a period of
three or four days according to the Burmese calendar. The highlight of the
festival is people throwing water on themselves and others to get relief from
the heat and to wash away the sins of the past year.</P>
      <P>Chiu welcomed everyone to come enjoy an exotic experience and "get wet" at
Jhonghe's celebration to be held in the city's suburban district of Nanshihjiao.</P>
      <P>Nanshihjiao has a significant Burmese minority, with many signs of the Southeast
Asian nation's culture on display, including a number of restaurants featuring
Burmese delicacies.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the celebrations within the designated festival area on Huahsin Street
will feature a series of fun-filled activities, including afloat parade.</P>
      <P>Water facilities, including large scale tanks to let revelers "reload, " will
also be set up so that everyone can enjoy splashing and spraying one another to
their heart's content, he said.</P>
      <P>One of the main features will be a "spray tunnel, " borrowed from organizers of
the Yilan International  Children's Folklore and Folkgame Festival.</P>
      <P>Anyone wanting to enter the festival area will have to "undergo a baptism" by
walking through the spray tunnel, after which, "anything goes," Chiu said.</P>
      <P>During his visit to the county government, Chiu also invited Chou to attend the
celebrations, jokingly challenging him to a water fight. A smiling Chou accepted
the challenge and invitation to attend the festival, with both men wishing all
Burmese people in Taiwan a happy and prosperous new year.</P>

      <P>The Vatican, Taiwan's only diplomatic ally in Europe, might send one of its
ambassadors posted in a nearby country rather than a high-level delegation to
attend President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration ceremony May 20, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Anne Hung, director-general of MOFA's Department of European Affairs, said at a
regular press briefing that the Republic of China's embassy in Vatican City has
not yet received any information on the issue.</P>
      <P>However, since the Holy See has remained "low-key" recently regarding political
contacts with Taiwan, the MOFA "does not expect the Vatican to dispatch a high-
ranking delegation to attend the inauguration," she said.</P>
      <P>Hung suggested instead that the Holy See might send an ambassador stationed
close to Taiwan on May 20 instead.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China established diplomatic ties with the Vatican in 1942 and
the Holy See remains Taiwan's only ally in Europe.</P>
      <P>In May 2004, the Vatican sent Archbishop Patrick Coveney, who was the papal
nuncio, or ambassador, to New Zealand, to attend the inauguration of President
Chen Shui-bian in 2004.</P>
      <P>The Vatican's low-key approach to Taiwan reflects its recent efforts to improve
relations with Communist China, which has not recognized the Holy See since
Chairman Mao Zedong drove out the papal nuncio more than half a century ago.</P>
      <P>Last November, a Vatican delegation visited China and met with representatives
of the government. It has also recently hinted at the possibility of moving its
embassy in Taiwan back to Beijing.</P>
      <P>China,  however,  has  imposed  two preconditions  for the normalization of
relations that have stalled the resumption of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>It insists that the Vatican break diplomatic relations with Taiwan and refrain
from interfering in China's internal affairs, especially in the area of
religion, conditions that the Vatican cannot accept.</P>
      <P>There are around 300,000 Catholics in Taiwan compared to over 10 million in

      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou has declined an invitation to attend this year's
computerized warfare simulation because he believes it should be top secrets and
open exclusively to the president and his subordinates, Ma's spokesman Lo Chih-
chiang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lo said that "it is not appropriate" for Ma, who will only assume office on May
20, to be part of the secret operations scheduled for April 25-27.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said earlier in the day that it regretted that Ma could
not take part in this year's war games because of his "tight schedule," saying
that Ma "has missed an opportunity to learn the comprehensive operations of the
national security system."</P>
      <P>Ma has been busy traveling around Taiwan to thank supporters and visit business
leaders and political figures after winning the March 22 election.</P>
      <P>Lo noted that sources at the Presidential Office said that after Ma won the
March 22 presidential election, President Chen had instructed the National
Security Council to invite Ma to observe the simulated war games to highlight
his determination to push for an institutionalized mechanism for a "peaceful
transfer of power."</P>
      <P>This year's war games will have President Chen go to a command center in
suburban Taipei, while Vice President Annette Lu will go to another command
center, with the two communicating via video conference a warfare response.</P>
      <P>Lo said that since the war-preparation exercises will be a top secret within the
government and the Presidential Office, Ma's camp concluded that it is not
appropriate for him to participate.</P>
      <P>The simulated war games, which will have administrative, national security
officials and government heads converging in the command center in suburban
Taipei, have been carried out each year since 2005.</P>
      <P>The purpose is to provide a reference to national leaders and department heads
in their decision making so as to help them familiarize themselves with how to
react to crises and to upgrade their capacity in handling crises when the

people in the southern port city have applied to join the party or to renew
their membership after the presidential race, in which the KMT ticket of Ma
Ying-jeou and Vincent Siew stunningly defeated their DPP rivals by a broad
margin of more than 2.21 million votes.</P>
      <P>The Ma-Siew ticket also beat the DPP ticket in Kaohsiung City, a traditional DPP
stronghold, grabbing some 468,000 votes, which exceeded the DPP ticket's 440,000
-- the first KMT electoral victory in the city.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with Ma's and Siew's inauguration on May 20, Hsu told reporters
his division is organizing to recruit more fresh blood before that date to
further cement the party's power base in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>The KMT has about 53,000 party members in Kaohsiung City -- Taiwan's second-
largest city after Taipei and the largest city in southern Taiwan, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Chang Chih-ming, head of the DPP's Kaohsiung City branch, said
his party is also doing its best to attract young new members in Kaohsiung City
as part of its efforts to overhaul the party following its presidential election
defeat.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the DPP's branch in Kaohsiung City will organize a
100-member recruitment drive on April 20 in the hope of injecting a new lease on
life to the party after its consecutive defeat in the Jan.  12 legislative
elections and the recent presidential contest.</P>
      <P>The DPP has little time to waste as it needs to gear up to lift party morale and
strengthen its power base in Kaohsiung City ahead of the 2010 city mayor
elections, Chang explained.</P>

      <P>Following a recent recall by U.S. authorities of a particular brand of
children's sunglasses imported from China, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
announced in a press release Tuesday that all children's sunglasses will be
inspected before they go on the market.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) on April 3 announced the
voluntary  recall of 144,000 units of children's sunglasses imported from China
by American retailer StyleMark, after it was found that the surface paint on the
temples of the sunglasses contained levels of lead in excess of the federal lead
paint standards.</P>
      <P>While there have been no reports to date of illness among children wearing the
glasses, the CPSC urged consumers to immediately take the sunglasses away from
children and contact StyleMark for instructions on returning the product for a
free replacement pair.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection under the MOEA reacted
to the U.S. recall by imposing a compulsory inspection of children's sunglasses
before the products go on the market, a measure that will take effect April 15.</P>
      <P>The bureau said it will follow current toy safety standards and add a new
category to inspect children sunglasses for lead paint.</P>
      <P>To help trace the suspect products, the bureau has issued a description of the
sunglasses and is urging local consumers to report the purchase of any such
product, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>The sunglasses  are described  as having Main Street Drag characters on the
bottom of one lens and dark metallic blue or dark metallic red frames with gray

(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several Taiwanese microbiologists have unraveled the mechanism of an
immunoprotein -- antimicrobial peptide, or AMP-- which was found to kill
pathogenic bacteria by penetrating their cell membranes, a local newspaper
reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the China Times newspaper,  researchers  said antimicrobial peptide
-- a natural antibiotic agent in the human immune system -- will first punch a
hole on the bacterium's membrane and then inhibit the subject from healing
itself by continuously expanding the aperture.</P>
      <P>"In the end, the microbe dies as the in-cell equilibrium is destroyed, " said
Lee Ming-Tao, an assistant research fellow at the Hsinchu-based National
Synchrotron Radiation Research Center and a co-author of the paper published by
the U.S. science journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</P>
      <P>Antimicrobial peptide, first found by scientists in the 1980s, exists in many
species, including the shiitake mushroom, African clawed toad, and humans.
Although antimicrobial peptide has been used in some drugs -- including
magainin, an antibiotic named after the African clawed toad -- its mechanism is
still little known.</P>
      <P>Lee and three other team members -- Hung Wei-chin of the Kaohsiung- based
Chinese Military Academy, Chen Fang-yu of National Central University in
Taoyuan, and Huey W. Huang of Rice University in Houston -- worked for six years
on the project to better understand the mechanism of antimicrobial peptide and
submitted their research paper to PNAS in late 2007.</P>
      <P>Describing their findings as fundamental, Lee said he hopes the results can be a
springboard for anti-microbial or anti-cancer drug development.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Deputy Kaohsiung Mayor Chiu Tai-san said Tuesday he welcomed the plan by a local
tycoon to invest in the port city, while another city official expressed the
hope that the move would serve as an incentive to attract downstream
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Chiu's comments came in the wake of a statement by Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry
Guo that he is willing to comply with President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's wishes to
invest in the Kaohsiung Software Park to help achieve the balanced development
of northern and southern Taiwan. Guo, whose company is the world's leading
electronics contract manufacturer, made the proposal during a meeting with Ma on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that after learning more about Hon Hai's investment plan, the city
government will brief Guo on the operations of software park and also on the
Kaohsiung Multifunctional Commerce and Trade Park.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has attached great
importance to the development of the Kaohsiung Software Park, and that it
allocated NT$150 million (US$4.93 million) last year to finance the development
of the park.</P>
      <P>A development fund for small- and medium- businesses under the MOEA will provide
NT$10 million to organize an incubation center at the software park.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Council Speaker Chuang Chi-wan said Tuesday that he hoped Hon Hai
would invest in the park "immediately" and would serve as an engine to bring
more investment to the city.</P>
      <P>Chuang said that although Kaohsiung has an airport, a harbor and a convenient
transportation network that includes high speed rail and mass rapid transit
systems, the country's "closed-door" policy and the lack of direct cross-strait
transportation over the past eight years had made it difficult for the city to
develop its high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>"The Hon Hai investment project would provide a much needed shot in the arm to
Kaohsiung's high-tech industry," he said.</P>
      <P>He expressed confidence that if leading manufacturers such as Hon Hai or Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. invest in Kaohsiung, downstream businesses would
follow.</P>
      <P>Chuang suggested that the Kaohsiung Multifunctional Commerce and Trade Park be
renamed the "Kaohsiung Multifunctional High-tech Commerce and Trade Park," to
attract high-tech manufacturers.</P>
      <P>He said that the city's priority will be to develop its high-tech industry as a
means of boosting its economic development.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Korean animal rights groups appealed to their Taiwan counterparts and Taiwan
lawmakers Tuesday to help stop the South Korean government from amending the law
to classify dogs as livestock for consumption.</P>
      <P>Representatives of several groups, including the Korean Association for Animal
Protection (KAAP) and Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth (CARE), made their
case at a news conference in Taipei Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CARE representative Park So-yeon noted that the South Korean government had
passed a law banning the sale of dog meat and strictly enforced it ahead of the
1988 Seoul Olympics to improve the country's image. However, shortly after the
games ended, the government relaxed enforcement, and dog meat restaurants were
soon back in business, he said.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, because the government is not enforcing its animal welfare laws, many
Koreans assume it is legal to raise dogs for the cooking pot, to slaughter them
and sell the meat, he said.</P>
      <P>Park said that about 2 million dogs are consumed in South Korea each year.</P>
      <P>On March 24, the Seoul municipal government said it planned to propose to the
central government that the law be amended to classify dogs as livestock in
order to set food safety standards for South Korean lovers of dog meat.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wang Hsing-nan, who played an
instrumental role in the passage of legislation to outlaw the killing of dogs
for food and the sale of dog meat in Taiwan, said at the press conference that
there is no need today for dog meat to be used as food.</P>
      <P>Wang said that respect for life is a universal value and that the protection of
animal rights is a sign of a civilized society. He added that because there are
so many other sources of protein today, there is no need to eat dog meat, and
questioned why the Seoul government wants to legalize such a practice.</P>
      <P>Chu Tseng-hung, director of the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan,
supported Wang's statement, saying that long ago, many humans depended on animal
meat for survival but that in this modern age, this is no longer the case as
there are so many other alternatives.</P>
      <P>He claimed that people today have become excessively reliant on meat, adding
that the raising of livestock poses a threat to human health by providing a
channel for the spread of many serious diseases.</P>
      <P>KAAP representatives  displayed several photos at the news conference to
illustrate the terrible treatment of dogs in South Korea and the appalling
conditions in which they are raised for their meat. Some of the photos showed
dogs crammed into small metal cages with no room to move.</P>
      <P>Park said that the environment in which the dogs are raised is very unsanitary,
and that they are usually fed old food scraps, such as moldy bread.</P>
      <P>Representatives of a Taiwan animal rights group brought several healthy and
active dogs to the news conference to demonstrate the stark contrast to the
abused animals shown in the KAAP's photos.</P>
      <P>Soon after the Seoul government's announcement of its plan to classify dogs as
livestock for consumption, Korean animal rights groups voiced their strong
protest and urgently began soliciting assistance from other countries around
Asia to convince the South Korean central government to reject the proposal.</P>

      <P>Several advocates for the unemployed publicly backed current freezes on
gasoline, electricity and water prices Wednesday and urged the incoming
Kuomintang administration to devise measures to help the country's 420,000
jobless and their families.</P>
      <P>Two groups promoting the rights of workers -- one that lobbies for the rights of
the unemployed and another that promotes the hiring of older workers -- urged
the new KMT government in a statement to adopt a package of relief measures for
the unemployed.</P>
      <P>They suggested increasing unemployment benefits paid to qualified claimants from
60 percent to 70 percent of their previous average monthly salary and extending
the benefit period from six months to one year.</P>
      <P>They also advocated extending the age employed workers and Taiwanese citizens
could join the employment insurance program from 60 to 65 and called on the new
government to remove the six-month cap on national health insurance premium
subsidies for those without work.</P>
      <P>They also urged the government to provide a fixed monthly subsidy for food,
fuel, water and electricity for those who have been jobless for more than one
year.</P>
      <P>In the statement, Su Cheng, head of the advocacy group for the unemployed,
dismissed  a public hearing  held Monday  by the legislature's Economics and
Energy Committee on fuel, electricity and water prices, branding it as nothing
but an attempt to push price hikes.</P>
      <P>The groups warned that increases in prices in any of the three categories would
carry over to other commodity prices and said the unemployed  and their
families  would  be forced  to bear a disproportionate burden of the price
rises.</P>

      <P>The performance will be Lu's second in Taiwan. In September last year, he played
with Taiwan's National Chinese Orchestra to a full house on The Butterfly
Lovers' Violin Concerto, a musical adaptation of a Chinese legend about a tragic
romance between two lovers, Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai.</P>
      <P>Thursday's concert will begin at 7:30 p.m., with the orchestra's music director
and chief conductor Gernot Schmalfuss at the helm.</P>
      <P>In addition to playing several Taiwanese folk songs, including "The Torment Of A
Flower" and "Tide Over With Romance," Lu will collaborate with the Evergreen
Symphony Orchestra to play Chen Gang's "Sunshine on Taxkorgan" -- a fantasy
originally composed for the erhu,  a traditional Chinese musical instrument --
and Dmitri Kabalevsky's "Violin Concerto," a technically demanding composition
that is rarely performed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The orchestra will also perform Gioacchino Rossini's "The Barber of Serville:
Overture" and Czech composer Dvorak's "Symphony No. 7," a Bohemian number
passionately acclaimed by the German composer Brahms.</P>
      <P>Lu is hailed as the most celebrated violinist of China. He was born in 1969 in
Qingdao, Shandong province, and began studying the violin with his father at age
4.</P>
      <P>He was accepted by the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing as a special
student when he was only 8. Three years later, he studied with Lord Yehudi
Menuhin in London. In 1984 he returned to China for advanced studies at the
Conservatory in Beijing. Five years later, he studied at the Juilliard School of
Music in New York City.</P>
      <P>Lu, who now lives in New York, was the first Asian violinist to win the gold
prize at the Paganini International Violin Competition in Italy in 1987 when he
was only 17. He has also won numerous international competitions in China, the
United Kingdom and the United States, and has performed in more than 30
countries in Asia, Europe, as well as North and South America.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although many part-time workers have seen their pay increase since a raise in
minimum wage last year, a minority of the workers remain underpaid, according to
the results of a survey released Tuesday by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the council in November 2007 among 3,112 part-timers,
was aimed at evaluating the work status, labor conditions and the effect of the
minimum wage hike on such workers.</P>
      <P>On July 1, 2007, the government raised the minimum hourly pay for part-time
workers from NT$66 to NT$95.</P>
      <P>The survey revealed that while only 44.3 percent of the respondents received
over NT$95 per hour before the adjustment, the percentage climbed to 92.8
percent after the change, meaning that 8.2 percent of the respondents were still
paid less than the minimum wage.</P>
      <P>Among workers who saw their hourly wage increase to over NT$95, 13 percent said
their employers decreased hiring after the wage hike, 81 percent said their
employers made no change in staff numbers, and 6 percent said their employers
increased hiring.</P>
      <P>After the minimum wage hike, 7.5 percent more part-timers were paid hourly, 6.8
percent more were paid monthly, and 4.1 percent more were paid daily.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 49 percent of part-timers were students, and 18.1 percent
were housewives.</P>
      <P>In terms of the jobs undertaken by the respondents, the largest group -- 19.9
percent -- were working as cashiers.</P>
      <P>Waiters formed the second-largest group at 12.8 percent, followed by
miscellaneous workers who accounted for 12.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Compared with 71 percent of respondents who were paid hourly, 21 percent were
paid monthly.</P>
      <P>On average, the respondents worked 28 hours per week, equal to 60 percent of the
weekly work hours of full-time workers.</P>
      <P>The flexible work hours of part-time work was mentioned by the largest number of
respondents -- 48 percent -- as the reason for them to choose that type of jobs.</P>
      <P>While 23 percent of part-time workers surveyed said they picked the jobs because
they were interested in them, 20 percent did so because the jobs were simpler.</P>
      <P>Another 15 percent of the respondents said they could not manage a full-time job
because of family-related reasons, while 10 percent wanted to shorten their work
hours, and 9.7 percent could not find a full-time job.</P>
      <P>According to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, if
all workers who work less than 35 hours per week are defined as part-timers,
there would be more than 366,000 part-timers in Taiwan, accounting for 3.6
percent of the country's work force.</P>
      <P>The percentage is lower than South Korea's 8.8 percent, Japan's 24.5 percent and

      <P>A Kaohsiung County service center opened a program Tuesday for foreign spouses
of Taiwanese nationals to help them adapt to life in Taiwan, an official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The two-hour course is the first of its kind in the southern county, according
to the official.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that scores of foreign wives do not know their rights and
legal obligations, as specified in the residence law enacted by the Ministry of
the Interior, the service center under the National Immigration Agency has
decided to offer the orientation program so that these women can have a better
understanding of the terms of the residence law, the official said.</P>
      <P>The course also offers social welfare information and tips on how to lead a
better life in Taiwan, the official stated.</P>
      <P>Similar programs will be offered in the county three times a month, according to
a service center plan.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are more than 6,000 foreign spouses in Kaohsiung County, with
Vietnamese women accounting for the highest percentage. Foreign spouses from
Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines are also among that number,
according the official.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that between 35 to 40 new foreign spouses settle in Kaohsiung
County each month.</P>
      <P>According the residence law, new foreign spouses should apply for residence
permits after they arrive in Taiwan, said the official, adding that they are
eligible to apply for ID cards after they have lived in the country for three
years.</P>

Landis Hotel Group Stanley Yen, said that Taiwan's cultural attributes are its
best assets in developing its tourism.</P>
      <P>"Culture and tourism not only are inseparable but also complement each other,
and visitors bring vitality to a culture, which also adds depth and meaning to
tourism," he said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that to market Taiwan as a desirable destination for international
tourists,  the country has to be aware of its advantages, must make detailed
plans and effectively execute them, and needs to envision what would be
essential to its sustained competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Yen said that the proposal to open up to more tourists from China would prove to
be only a short-term solution.</P>
      <P>"The idea of making money from an influx of Chinese tourists is ill-conceived, "
he said. "Although this plan may help to boost the stagnant economy in the short
term, it is actually the people and culture here that can make this business
sustainable."</P>
      <P>Yen said that he would like to refer every decision maker in the government to
his book because it records his 37 years of experience in the travel and tourism
industry.</P>
      <P>"I hope that this book, which includes all my experience and knowledge in the
field of tourism promotion, will serve as reference for decision-makers and
anyone else who loves and cares about Taiwan," he said. He described the book as
his "final report before graduating from the industry, " in a reference to his
imminent retirement from the chairmanship of the Taiwan Visitors Association.</P>
      <P>Yen, who is dubbed "Hotel Godfather, " said that when he retires from the
tourism industry, he will continue his work in the areas of culture and
philanthropy, and will also play the role of a good adviser -- though hard on
the ears -- to the new government.</P>
      <P>His first piece of advice to President-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who will take office
May 20, would be to first find the best team, one that shares his views and
goals, then let its members use their talents to the fullest, he said.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that tourism could be a good diplomatic tool for Taiwan to
raise its profile in the international community, adding that he always believed
the main purpose of the industry is not to make money but to make friends in the
world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei city government to follow law over nationality probe: mayor</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Tuesday that the city government will comply with
the law over a proposal by ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) councilors
to investigate whether he, chief city administrative heads and city councilors
hold dual nationality or U.S. green cards.</P>
      <P>Hau said before giving an administrative report at the city council that his
green card, giving him U.S. permanent residency status, expired a long time ago.</P>
      <P>He explained that his green card became invalid because he has used his Republic
of China passport and U.S. visas for his visits to the United States since he
began serving as a lawmaker in 1996.</P>
      <P>Taiwan law bars anyone with foreign nationality from holding public office,
although there is no law preventing civil servants, councilors or lawmakers from
holding a green card.</P>
      <P>Hau's remarks came in response to a motion proposed by several DPP city
councilors at the council to ask the city government to launch the
investigation.</P>
      <P>DPP City Councilor Hsu Chia-chin said that when President Chen Shui-bian served
as Taipei mayor from 1994-1998, Deputy Mayor Chen Shih-meng and David Ta-wei
Poo, head of the city's Department of Transportation, renounced their U.S.
nationality after coming under harsh criticism.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that former Taipei City Councilor Tim Chang also renounced his U.S.
nationality before being sworn in.</P>
      <P>Noting that opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Ching-an also once held
U.S. nationality despite serving as a Taipei city councilor, Hsu said the city
council should be fair in handling such cases, take back the salary Lee has been
paid in public office and investigate her responsibility.</P>
      <P>For her part, DPP Taipei City Councilor Wu Su-yao said that after Lee admitted
that she once had foreign nationality,  the KMT legislative caucus also raised a
proposal to ask the central government to investigate the nationality of
government agency heads.</P>
      <P>Wu added that the Taipei city government should also conduct an investigation.</P>
      <P>City Council Speaker Wu Bi-chu said she will respect the mayor's decision  on
whether  the city government  should launch  the investigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA approves proposals for US$86.7 million in China investment</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
04/08/08  20:28:10
(By Yeh Fang-hsun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced  Tuesday that it has approved
four China investment proposals from local manufacturers, which have a total
investment amount of US$86. 7 million (NT$ 2.64 billion).</P>
      <P>The four companies which sought MOEA approval to invest in China -- Lingsen
Precision Industries, King Yuan Electronics, IC assembly company Sigurd Corp.
and Siliconware Precision Industries, will invest in integrated circuit
packaging (ICP) and testing.</P>
      <P>The companies will invest US$10 million, US$20 million, US$6.7 million, and
US$50 million, respectively.</P>
      <P>In a meeting Tuesday, the MOEA decided that the investment proposals met the
clauses in the China investment procedure issued by the ministry's Investment
Commission. The procedure aims to make sure Taiwan's investments in China will
do no harm to Taiwan's industries and economy, such as by leaking key
technologies to the mainland, said Fan Liang-tung, the commission's executive
secretary.</P>
      <P>Under the procedure, investment plans require approval from the MOEA if they
involve a single investment that exceeds US$100 million, the company's total
investment in China that reaches US$200 million, or the investment  that could
transfer core local industries' technologies to China.</P>
      <P>Fan said the core industries mainly involve the manufacturing of 8- inch wafers
and 4-inch TFT panels, and IC packaging.</P>
      <P>After today's meeting, what the commission will need from each of the companies
is a written document containing their commitments on the terms of their
investment,  including the financial plan, information on any technology
transfers, information on the company's domestic investment, as well as
employment information, to further assess the plans thoroughly.</P>
      <P>Fan noted one of the terms the commission is concerned about the most is future
investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Within the next three years, Lingsen Precision Industries, King Yuan
Electronics, IC assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware Precision
Industries have all made commitments to return their capital to Taiwan, in the
amounts of NT$2 billion, NT$19.2 billion, NT$3 billion and NT$23 billion,
respectively, Fan said.</P>
      <P>He added that the commission will make sure the promises are delivered once
these investments are under way.</P>
      <P>"In a bid to keep high-end technologies in Taiwan, the procedure would push
China investment from Taiwan to focus on down scale manufacturers rather than
technology-concentrated makers, " Fan stressed.</P>
      <P>The commission will hold a second round of meetings to decide if those proposals
are to take effect, adding that the final decision will be made no later than
the end of April, Fan said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tainan county chief urges ex-DPP head to assume chairmanship</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
04/08/08  20:45:23
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih on Tuesday called on former Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Lin I-hsiung to assume chairmanship of the
party again so as to help end infighting.</P>
      <P>Su made the comments to reporters following a meeting with former Premier Su
Tseng-chang, who paired up with former Premier Frank Hsieh to compete against
their rivals from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) but lost in the March 22
presidential election.</P>
      <P>The election defeat and an earlier one for the party in the Jan. 12 legislative
elections have caused a lot of finger pointing within the ruling DPP, especially
as top members vie for the chairmanship. A decision on who will be next chairman
is expected to be announced in May.</P>
      <P>The Hsieh-Su ticket lost the presidential election to the KMT ticket of Ma Ying-
jeou and Vincent Siew by a wide margin of more than 2.21 million votes. Hsieh,
who concurrently served as DPP chairman, quit the chairmanship quickly following
the election defeat. Hsieh later agreed to stay on the post until May 20 when
the country's new president will be sworn in.</P>
      <P>Su Huan-chih on Tuesday voiced his hope that the party's next chairman should be
produced through negotiations instead of a direct vote by party members to avoid
already fierce infighting intensifying further.</P>
      <P>He urged Lin, who voluntarily stepped down from the party's top post in May 2000
following the DPP took over the presidency from the KMT for the first time in
Taiwan's poltiical history, to assume the chairmanship again so as to bring an
end to the party's power struggle and effectively reinforce its support base to
better prepare for future elections.</P>
      <P>Lin has long been viewed by many DPP supporters as a "puritan." His mother and
twin daughters were murdered in 1980, when the KMT was the governing party and
the DPP was still considered illegal. The murders remain unsolved.</P>
      <P>The DPP did relatively well in Tainan County -- the home county of President
Chen. Traditionally the party has done well in southern Taiwan, but in the
recent presidential and legislative races, it lost many votes in the south to
the KMT.</P>
      <P>Echoing Su Huan-chih's remarks, Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tian-tsair contended that
the DPP should produce its next chairman through negotiations or hold a direct
vote within the party without any restrictions to avoid a fiercer power struggle
or fresh complications at an already extremely difficult time for the party.</P>
      <P>The chairmanship issue has become a thorn on the side of the DPP as a result of
the party's stunning defeat in the presidential race -- the worst since its
establishment some 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>The party's Central Advisory Committee decided Monday to advance the vote for
the party chairman to May 18, two days ahead of the May 20 chairmanship takeover
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP plans to hold a major meeting on April 19 aimed at reviewing
the party's performance  in the March 22 presidential election. President Chen,
Vice President Annette Lu and all former party chairs will be invited to take
part.</P>

      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew will head a nine-member delegation that will
include just three local corporate heads at an economic forum in southern China
later this week, a spokesman for the delegation said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The three corporate heads are Morris Chang, founder and chairman of the world's
largest contract chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) ,
Walsin Lihwa Corp. Chairman Chiao You-lun and Taiwan Cement Corp. Chairman
Leslie Koo.</P>
      <P>The announcement came two days after Siew confirmed that he will take part in
the Boao Forum for Asia slated to be held in China's Hainan Province April 11-13
in his capacity as chairman of the Taipei-based Cross-Straits Common Market
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Wang Yu-chi explained that Siew filed an application after the
deadline for registration for the annual gathering, and that with little time
left, the foundation could only invite the foundation's board members or
consultants.</P>
      <P>He offered a public apology to other business leaders who had wanted to take
part in the forum.</P>
      <P>Wang said the delegation members will take the opportunity to offer Taiwan's
goodwill and sincerity to China in the hope of starting a new beginning for
cross-Taiwan Strait relations after the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) won the
presidential election in March and will return to power in May after eight years
of Democratic Progressive Party rule.</P>
      <P>In addition, the delegation believes that if the government wants to raise
Taiwan's international profile, it should try to take part in as many
international gatherings -- such as the Boao Forum -- as possible, remaining
pragmatic about which name the country should use, Wang went on.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that as security at the forum will be very tight to protect
participating  state leaders and prime ministers  from Australia, Chile,
Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Tanzania and Tonga,
Siew will only be accompanied by one security guard.</P>
      <P>He did not confirm whether or not Siew will meet with Chinese President Hu
Jintao at the forum, saying that Siew's schedule will only be confirmed after he
arrives in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>City government blamed for incompetence in protecting historic site</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei city councilor accused the city government Tuesday of incompetence in
failing to protect one of the capital city's historic sites after discovering
that old wisteria vines at the Wisteria House, a local teahouse, are dying.</P>
      <P>The Wisteria House, a 1920-built two-story Japanese-style wooden building, is
named after three wisteria vines in its courtyard, one of which is nearly 90
years old.</P>
      <P>The house has been a teahouse since 1981, serving traditional tea and snacks,
and is a favorite  spot for local artists  and intellectuals due to its simple
yet elegant and quiet atmosphere that harks back to a bygone age.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Department of Cultural Affairs began work in 2005 to renovate
the old house and the renovations were scheduled to be completed in January to
allow the facility to be re-opened in March. However, the schedule has been
delayed.</P>
      <P>City Councilor Li Keng Kuei-fang inspected the site earlier in the day along
with several city officials and executives of the Wisteria Cultural Association
(WCA), which is contracted by the city to manage and operate the teahouse.</P>
      <P>According to Li, it is the repair work that has damaged the old vines which,
according to the Cultural Heritage Preservation Law, are part of the protected
historic site.</P>
      <P>However, teahouse manager Chou Yu's wife Lin Huei-feng said it was because high
buildings surrounding the house block the sunlight -- essential to the plants in
the house's courtyard.</P>
      <P>One of the three vines has also been sick for years due to termites and experts
from the Forestry Bureau are assisting to control the damage, the WCA said.</P>
      <P>Lin said one of the other two vines is thriving and is now blossoming,  but the
other died before the beginning  of the renovation.</P>
      <P>The Wisteria House, located on Xingsheng South Road, was a residence of top-
ranking Japanese officials until 1945.</P>
      <P>In 1950, it was taken over by the Ministry of Finance and was then used as the
residence of the then-customs agency chief, Chou Teh-wei. After his death in
1975, his son Chou Yu continued to occupy the house and turned it into a
teahouse six years later.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the ministry tried to take back the house, but the move triggered an
outcry among artists, scholars and ancient monument protection activists. That
same year, the city government designated Wisteria House as a historic site.</P>
      <P>In 2000, Lung Ying-tai, the then-city director of cultural affairs who is also a
famous writer and political commentator, expressed willingness to take over the
management of the teahouse and asked the National Property Bureau to voluntarily
give the property and the plot of land on which it sits to the city government
for public use.</P>
      <P>The Wisteria House now belongs to the city government, which has turned the
property into a space for cultural exchanges, exhibitions, workshops and
performances, as well as a place where authentic Chinese tea drinks and
traditional Taiwanese tea culture can still be experienced.</P>

      <P>Total volunteer service time in the same year reached 12.14 million hours, an

      <P>Taipei County in northern Taiwan topped other local governments, with 12,500
volunteers, followed by Taipei City, which had more than 12,400 volunteers, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>In terms of participation rate, Taitung County in eastern Taiwan ranked top,

      <P>The Watoto Children's Choir from Uganda, East Africa, will perform two concerts

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu received the choir and its leader and introduced them at

      <P>The two concerts in Taichung, sponsored by a local community service
association, will take place at 2:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. in he city's Chungshan
Hall. Tickets are free, with a maximum allocation of four tickets per person.</P>
      <P>The Watoto Children's Choir has already given eight "Concerts of Hope" in major
cities since its arrival March 28, including three in Taipei and one each in
Changhua, Hsinchu, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Yila under the sponsorship of World
Vision Taiwan, a Christian relief organization dedicated to helping
underprivileged  children and families.</P>
      <P>This is the choir's second visit to Taiwan. During its last visit in 2006, the
children moved the hearts of their audiences with their songs and the tour was a
resounding success, with considerable funds raised.</P>
      <P>The choir's 18 members are all orphans aged between 6 and 13, each of whom has a
sad story to tell. Their tour of Taiwan is intended to increase awareness about
the AIDS crisis in Africa and raise funds for a missionary program -- the Watoto
Child Care Ministries -- that helps AIDS orphans in Uganda.</P>
      <P>About 2 million in Uganda are afflicted with AIDS and most of the 1,600 children
in the care of the ministries have lost their parents to the disease.</P>
      <P>Watoto, the name of the village in Uganda from which the choir takes its name

    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid a slowdown in global trade, Taiwan's foreign trade value in March posted a
29.6 percent rise year-on-year to reach a record US$48.34 billion (NT$1. 47
trillion), the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Led by the precision instrument sector, which rose 69.3 percent year-on-year in
March, Taiwan recorded an export value of US$24.35 billion, the highest in
history and an increase of 22.8 percent compared with the same month last year.</P>
      <P>The BOFT said because of the soaring price of raw materials and fuel
internationally, Taiwan's import value was also the highest ever recorded  --
US$24.08  billion --  with a 37.3 percent rise year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Agricultural and industrial materials accounted for 80 percent of total imports,
with crude oil and wheat in high demand, rising 114.3 percent and 243.2 percent
year-on-year, respectively.</P>
      <P>The foreign trade surplus was therefore down 92.4 percent year-on-year to US$170
million, a sharp decline compared with US$3.24 billion in February this year,
according to the BOFT.</P>
      <P>Given the decline in the U.S. economy and its weaker currency, Asian exporting
countries like Taiwan and South Korea would not able to rely on the U.S. market,
the BOFT forecast. Taiwan's exports to the U.S. in the first three months of
2008 accounted for only 11.9 percent of the total export value, the lowest
percentage ever recorded, it stated.</P>
      <P>In light of the shrinking U.S market, exporters should explore emerging
economies such as Indonesia, India, Brazil, and Malaysia, the bureau advised.</P>
      <P>Touching  on the impact  on exporters  due to the recent appreciation of the
local currency, the BOFT called for the Central Bank of the Republic of China
(Taiwan) to make an effort to ensure that the fluctuations in New Taiwan dollar
are kept in line with those of other major currencies, including the euro and
the Japanese yen.</P>
      <P>Concerns over domestic inflation  should not undermine the importance of
maintaining export competitiveness, the BOFT stated, referring to the recent
Central Bank increase in key interest rates by 12.5 basis points that was aimed
at cooling inflation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP administration claims substantial economic gains</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
04/08/08  23:52:51
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The outgoing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration has achieved
almost all of its policy goals with regard to boosting economic growth while
keeping inflation and unemployment at bay over the past eight years, an
Executive Yuan official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) will deliver a report reviewing the country's economic progress over the
past eight years at the Executive Yuan's weekly meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting from the report, the official said the DPP administration has managed to
realize all of the targets it set for the country's economic growth, inflation
and unemployment rates during the eight years of its rule.</P>
      <P>Especially encouraging was the fact that the average economic growth rate for
President Chen Shui-bian's second term has reached 5.23 percent, higher than
South Korea's 4.7 percent, the official went on.</P>
      <P>Because of the time required to compile accurate economic records, figures
quoted in the report are based on data that had been compiled as of the end of
last year, the official said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) registered an
average growth of 0.89 percent for the period from 2000 to 2007, compared to an
inflation rate of 3 percent in South Korea, a 1 percent CPI growth in Singapore
and a decline of 0.8 percent in CPI in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"The figures indicate that Taiwan's consumer prices have been relatively stable
since the DPP grabbed the reins of power, " the official said, adding that the
CPI even registered negative growth for three consecutive years from 2001
through 2003.</P>
      <P>On the economic growth rate, the official said Taiwan recorded an average 4.1
percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2000 through 2007, higher
than the world's average of 3.2 percent, America's 2.6 percent and the euro
zone's 2.1 percent. But Taiwan fell behind South Korea which registered an
average of 5.2 percent GDP growth for the seven-year period.</P>
      <P>On the job front, Taiwan's unemployment rate dropped to 3.9 percent for 2006 and
2007, a new low in recent memory, the official said, adding that about 910,000
new job openings have been created during the past eight years. At the end of
2007, the number of employed persons reached 10.29 million.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's report on economic achievements will be the second of a series of
such reports on the accomplishments of the various ministries and agencies under
the Executive Yuan to be issued over the coming weeks before the inauguration of
new President Ma Ying-jeou from the opposition Kuomintang on May 20.</P>
      <P>The first of the series was delivered last Wednesday, which focused on the
accomplishments in infrastructure and transportation construction voer the past
eight years.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Customs Office announced Tuesday that it had seized 558
paphiopedilums, better known as slipper orchids, that had been imported
illegally from China via express delivery March 28.</P>
      <P>The office said in a news release that agricultural experts at the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture had established that the plants belong to a species
protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES).</P>
      <P>The treaty, signed in 1973, has more than 150 signatory countries who have
agreed to regulate global commerce in endangered animals and plants.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Customs Office impounded the rare plants and is following leads to
trace those responsible for the shipment, the news release said.</P>
      <P>Since November 1980, CITES has banned all commercial trade in paphiopedilum
species, except in the case of certain slipper orchids that can be proved to
have been cultivated. The measure is intended to protect the rare species in the
wild from the depredations of collectors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's foreign trade hits record high in March</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
04/09/08  10:56:05

    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid a slowdown in global trade, Taiwan's foreign trade value in March posted a
29.6 percent rise year-on-year to reach a record US$48.34 billion (NT$1. 47
trillion), the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Led by the precision instrument sector, which rose 69.3 percent year-on-year in
March, Taiwan recorded an export value of US$24.35 billion, the highest in
history and an increase of 22.8 percent compared with the same month last year.</P>
      <P>The BOFT said because of the soaring price of raw materials and fuel
internationally, Taiwan's import value was also the highest ever recorded  --
US$24.08  billion --  with a 37.3 percent rise year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Agricultural and industrial materials accounted for 80 percent of total imports,
with crude oil and wheat in high demand, rising 114.3 percent and 243.2 percent
year-on-year, respectively.</P>
      <P>The foreign trade surplus was therefore down 92.4 percent year-on-year to US$170
million, a sharp decline compared with US$3.24 billion in February this year,
according to the BOFT.</P>
      <P>Given the decline in the U.S. economy and its weaker currency, Asian exporting
countries like Taiwan and South Korea would not able to rely on the U.S. market,
the BOFT forecast. Taiwan's exports to the U.S. in the first three months of
2008 accounted for only 11.9 percent of the total export value, the lowest
percentage ever recorded, it stated.</P>
      <P>In light of the shrinking U.S market, exporters should explore emerging
economies such as Indonesia, India, Brazil, and Malaysia, the bureau advised.</P>
      <P>Touching  on the impact  on exporters  due to the recent appreciation of the
local currency, the BOFT called for the Central Bank of the Republic of China
(Taiwan) to make an effort to ensure that the fluctuations in New Taiwan dollar
are kept in line with those of other major currencies, including the euro and
the Japanese yen.</P>
      <P>Concerns over domestic inflation  should not undermine the importance of
maintaining export competitiveness, the BOFT stated, referring to the recent
Central Bank increase in key interest rates by 12.5 basis points that was aimed
at cooling inflation.</P>

      <P>Marjorie I. Bly, a nurse from the United States who has served Taiwanese leprosy
sufferers on Penghu Island for 54 years, died Tuesday of heart failure at the
age of 89.</P>
      <P>Bly's heart failure was the result of pneumonia brought on by a bout of flu,
said Wu Fang-tsan, Bly's doctor.</P>
      <P>Paying his last respects to Bly at the hospital,  Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-
fa described Bly as "Penghu's angel" and said that her death would bring sorrow
for many, adding that the county government will issue a public statement to
recognize her long-term devotion to the island.</P>
      <P>Wu Wen-chung, a local priest, said local residents will follow Bly's
instructions and decorate her funeral ceremony with her favorite sunflowers.</P>
      <P>Wu also said that at the funeral, there will not be too much talk or hymns. Bly
herself requested this, Wu went on, because "she did not pass away. She is just
sleeping."</P>
      <P>Bly, nicknamed by local residents as "Aunty White, " was assigned by her church
to come to Taiwan in 1952. She arrived in Penghu two years after that.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian bestowed a state medal upon Bly April 1, 2007, in
recognition of her contributions and of the sacrifices she has made for the

      <P>Animal protection activists denounced the Kaohsiung city government Tuesday for
killing off the fish in the Lotus Lake, which is being drained in preparation
for the 2009 World Games.</P>
      <P>The Animal Rescue Team Taiwan (ARTT), a Taichung-based non-profit group, urged
the public to rescue some of the fish in a small area of the lake that has not
yet been drained, as the southern port city prepares to dredge the lake in the
Zuoying district, which will be one of 24 venues of the World Games.</P>
      <P>Ni Ching-tai of the ARTT criticized the city government as putting its own
interests before the protection of living creatures. There should be a well-

      <P>A Taiwan trade official was named chairman of a World Trade Organization (WTO)
committee Tuesday, the first time any Taiwanese official has been appointed to
head a WTO subsidiary body.</P>
      <P>Henry Liu, a first secretary in Taiwan's representative office at the WTO, was
elected chairman of the Committee on the Trade-Related Investment Measures
(TRIMs) , which is one of the subsidiary bodies under the WTO Council for Trade
in Goods.</P>
      <P>The committee monitors the operation and implementation of commitments by
members to remove trade-restrictive or distorting investment measures, such as
local content or trade balancing requirements.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the appointment, Taiwan's WTO representative Lin Yi-fu said it
represents another way for Taiwan to make a more significant and active
contribution to the world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>"It is also an obvious benefit for Taiwan in terms of talent cultivation and
gaining experience," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan did not encounter any political interference during the election process,
Lin said, pointing out that Taiwan is a full member of the WTO and has exercized
its rights and duties there on an equal footing with all other WTO member
countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan university develops revolutionary wire inspection device</HEADLINE>

04/09/08  12:50:49
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Tainan-based university has developed a low-cost, compact wire inspection
device that will revolutionize the way construction constractors and machine
makers check their wiring assemblies, a local newspaper reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the Liberty Times, Southern Taiwan University of Technology (STUT)
has arranged to have a local manufacturer mass produce the device, which saves
time and manpower by checking the status of a group of wires simultaneously
rather than wire by wire as normally occurs at present.</P>
      <P>Researchers at the university said the gadget, dubbed the "digital wiring
inspector, " is comprised of a signal transmitting unit and a signal analyzing
unit.</P>
      <P>The transmitter, placed at one end of the wires, sends individual signals
through each wire to the analyzer at the other end. The analyzer indicates which
lines are functional and which are faulty by decoding the signals received.</P>
      <P>"It's like putting a yellow, a green and a red pellet into pipelines one, two,
and three, " explained Wei Chao-huang, an assistant professor in the
university's Department of Electrical Engineering.</P>
      <P>"If only the yellow and red pellet go out through the other end, then it can be
determined that pipeline two is broken."</P>
      <P>The new device can be operated by a single person, a huge advantage in today's
market.</P>
      <P>Wei said the most commonly used methods of wiring inspection require multiple
workers at a site to check each wire individually, usually by using an
additional common wire -- a reference wire designated by inspectors --  to
short-circuit  the wire being inspected.</P>
      <P>"When the workload is only a cable or two, it's not a problem using the
conventional ways, " Wei said, "but at a construction site, for example, where
there might be tens of rooms with hundreds of electrical  cables,  one-by-one
inspection  would be extremely time-consuming."</P>
      <P>Researchers said the prototype device, awarded a gold medal at the 2008 Thailand
International Invention Exhibition, cost less than NT$200 (about US$6.56) and
estimated that the price of the commercial version would be no more than NT$99.</P>

      <P>The culture surrounding Matsu, goddess of the sea, is not only one of the most
representative religious activities in Taiwan, it is a stabilizing force in
Taiwanese society, Vice President-elect Vincent Siew said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Siew, who traveled to the southern county of Chiayi to lead a ceremony marking
an important stop on the eight-day annual pilgrimage tour of Matsu, said that
the parade is not only an important religious event locally, it is now a high-
profile religious activity among Chinese communities around the world.</P>
      <P>The pilgrimage is part of celebrations for Matsu's birthday, which falls on the
23rd day of the third lunar month but is usually celebrated earlier with a
pilgrimage that starts from the renowned Jenn Lann Temple located in Dajia
township in the central county of Taichung and then proceeds through the
counties of Changhua, Yunlin and Chiayi.</P>
      <P>Matsu -- who legend has it was a young woman from China's Fujian Province who
was turned into a goddess after she sacrificed her life to rescue her fishermen
father and older brothers -- has been worshipped for more than one thousand
years by Chinese mainly living in coastal areas.</P>
      <P>At Wednesday's ceremony held at Feng Tien Temple in Chiayi County's Hsinkang
township, Siew was joined by Yen Ching-piao, chairman of Jenn Lann Temple, Feng
Tien Temple Chairman Lu Ming-sen and Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, as well as
Taichung Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng, in a worship ritual containing 28 lengthy
rites that have been handed down through the ages.</P>
      <P>The tradition has been observed for more than a century and has bloomed into
what Discovery Channel describes as one of the world's three major religious
festivals, thanks to the Jenn Lann Temple management's  introduction  of modern
marketing and advertising strategies into the program of festivities.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, the traditional eight-day religious walking pilgrimage has
evolved into a month-long carnival that incorporates religious, cultural,
fashion and tourism activities better known as the Taichung County Matsu
International Festival.</P>
      <P>Since the late 1990s, the annual pilgrimage has consistently attracted nearly 1
million Matsu worshipers who follow an image of Matsu borne on a palanquin along
the route.</P>
      <P>This year's Dajia Matsu festival began Feb. 20 and is scheduled to end April 28.</P>

      <P>China Steel Corp. (CSC), Taiwan's largest steel producer, posted a record
monthly high for sales in March at NT$20.447  billion (US$669.8 million) ,  the
company announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The figure represented a jump of 21.05 percent over the March 2007 level of
NT$16.892 billion and a 21.23 percent increase over February's sales of
NT$16.866 billion, the steel maker said in a statement.</P>
      <P>CSC's monthly sales first broke the NT$20 billion barrier in January this year,
boosted by rising prices for its products in both local and foreign markets, the
company said. The monthly figure again exceeded the NT$20 billion mark in March
thanks to increased output.</P>
      <P>According to rough estimates by the steel maker, in which the government remains
the largest shareholder, combined Q1 revenues totaled NT$57.353 billion, up by
16.74 percent year on year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, analysts predicted that CSC's earnings growth in the first half of
this year would outpace that registered in the same period of 2007. They said
the company's business in the second half of the year would depend on world
market conditions during that period. By Flor Wang)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Deputy Secretary-General Lan Shih-tsung said
Wednesday that the party owes about NT$70 million (US$2.3 million) for its
advertising in the recent presidential election, and not NT$400 million as
reported in a local weekly.</P>
      <P>Lan said that the DPP headquarters spent about NT$160 million on campaign ads
and publicity materials for the party's presidential candidate Frank Hsieh and
his running mate Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>Of that total, about NT$90 million has already been paid by the DPP
headquarters, with the remaining NT$70 million to be paid off in monthly
installments by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Lan was responding to an article in the most recent edition of the weekly Next
magazine that claimed the ruling party owed more than NT$400 million for
televised campaign ads during the presidential race.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan, who concurrently served as chief executive
of the Hsieh campaign, said that the party ran up debts during the campaign for
January's legislative elections, and that consequently, the DPP headquarters
lacked the resources to provide  anything  more than only very limited funds for
the presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>He added that as one-third of the central government subsidies provided to Hsieh
for his election campaign had already been handed over by Hsieh to the DPP
headquarters -- as required by DPP regulations -- and as Hsieh's own fund-
raising targets were nearly met, the Hsieh-Su campaign came close to breaking
even.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lan said that the DPP has already negotiated with relevant companies
and TV stations on a repayment schedule for the money it owes for presidential
campaign advertising and promotional materials.</P>
      <P>About NT$11 million will be payed back each month, he said, adding that if the
DPP were to pay the entire amount in one lump sum, it would have no money left
over for its day to day operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a high-ranking DPP official said that the party has in recent years
been borrowing money to pay off its debts, claiming that if the DPP's annual
operating budget remains at NT$300 million to NT$400 million, the party's
deficit will continue to balloon.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP has already mapped out a two-stage personnel streamlining
plan to bring spending under control, with the goal of reducing the party's
annual operating budget to levels at the beginning of the decade when the figure
stood at about NT$200 million.</P>

      <P>Taiwan fell four places to 17th place among 127 economies worldwide and ranked
last among the "Four Asian Dragons" in the "networked readiness index (NRI) , "
a measure of competitiveness in the information, communication and technology
(ICT) industry, according to a just released report.</P>
      <P>The Geneva-based World Economic Forum on Wednesday released The Global
Information Technology Report 2007-2008, which is considered the world's most
comprehensive and authoritative  international assessment of the impact of ICT
on the development process and competitiveness of nations.</P>
      <P>In the ranking of the index, which is designed to examine how prepared countries
are to use ICT effectively, Taiwan dropped to 17th place among the countries
covered by the report, while Korea impressively rose 10 places to rank 9th,
overtaking Taiwan for the first time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also was placed last among the "Four Asian Dragons," after Singapore,
which ranked 5th, South Korea and Hong Kong, which ranked 11th.</P>
      <P>"Korea offers a textbook  example of how to quickly  and advantageously join the
knowledge economy, by adopting an integrated public-private strategy focused on
Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT), innovation and education, "
said Irene Mia, Senior Economist of the forum's Global Competitiveness Network,
in a press release.</P>
      <P>Despite losing some ground this year, the report said, Taiwan is still ranked at
a "satisfactory"  place overall,  showing its resilience as one of the world's
largest ICT exporters and producers and a leading innovator.</P>
      <P>It ranked 1st place for high-tech exports and 3rd for the number of registered
utility patents, according to the report.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's development story is a textbook example of how a resource- poor rural
economy can transform itself in the short span of three decades  into a ICT
powerhouse,  thanks to coherent e-leadership from the government," it added.</P>
      <P>Denmark is the most networked economy, followed by Sweden, Switzerland, the
United States, Singapore, Finland, the Netherlands, Iceland, Korea and Norway.</P>
      <P>China slightly improved two places to 57th this year, showing weaknesses in its
underdeveloped ICT infrastructure and scarce individual usage rate.</P>
      <P>The index featured in the report covers three dimensions: general business as
well as the regulatory and infrastructure environment for ICT;  the readiness
of the three key stakeholder  groups -- individuals, businesses and governments
-- to use and benefit from ICT;  and their actual usage of the latest
information  and communication technologies available.</P>
      <P>Under  the theme "Fostering  Innovation  through  Networked Readiness, " this
year's report places a particular focus on the role of networked readiness in
spurring innovation.</P>

      <P>A man from Kaohsiung City was indicted Wednesday on charges of intimidation and
hindering public security for sending threatening letters to Taipei City Mayor
Hau Lung-bin late last year.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment issued by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office,
suspect Chuang Shun-kui allegedly sent a threatening letter containing a pair of
sheep testicles to Hau in protest of the Taipei Election Commission's stance on
the voting method used in the Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Chuang, who mailed the letter to Hau by private courier on Nov. 29, 2007, was
angry because the city insisted that voters cast ballots in the legislative
polls and on concurrently held referendums in two separate steps, in defiance of
Central Election Commission (CEC) orders that all ballots be picked up in one
single step.</P>
      <P>The procedural issue became one of the major points of debate in the run-up to
the elections and further stoked divisions between supporters of rival political
camps led by Hau's Kuomintang (KMT) and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>In the letter, Chuang blasted Hau for balking at the CEC's decision and accused
Hau of "trampling on the civil rights of Taiwan's people" by advocating the
"two-step" voting method. At the end of the letter, he signed the name of a
civic rights group that he coined.</P>
      <P>After investigation and questioning by Taipei prosecutors, Chuang admitted to
the act and was indicted for violating Article 305 of Taiwan's Criminal Code.</P>

      <P>National Security Bureau (NSB) officials have briefed Vice President-elect
Vincent Siew on the latest cross- Taiwan Strait situation and on security
measures prior to his departure for a forum in China, NSB Deputy Director-
General Tsai Te-sheng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the NSB officials reported to the vice president-elect upon his
request, although the vice president-elect will take part in the Boao Forum for
Asia, to be held April 11-13 in China's Hainan Province, in his capacity as
chairman of the Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks while fielding questions  from main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) lawmakers at a legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the NSB must provide adequate protection to the incumbent
president  and vice president  as well as the president-elect and vice
president-elect wherever they are, whether at home or abroad, according to the
law.</P>
      <P>The NSB also will offer full security to Siew at the Boao Forum in line with his
requirement, Tsai said, adding that Siew's office has also contacted the forum's
authorities to ask for security protection.</P>
      <P>Siew's attendance at the Boao Forum is set to carry historical significance  to
cross-strait ties due to his status as vice president-elect. Relevant issues,
including Siew's personal safety, have aroused widespread attention from across
the domestic political spectrum.</P>
      <P>His entourage will include entrepreneurs and aides from the Cross-Straits Common
Market Foundation that he founded in 2001 to promote the idea of setting up a

      <P>Siew's visit will be the first time that a vice president-elect from Taiwan will

      <P>The Third Taiwan International Motorcycle Industry Show opened Wednesday,
emphasizing environmental protection, with a special pavilion devoted to
featuring the most advanced equipment that incorporates green concepts and
technology, organizers said.</P>
      <P>"This year's show has introduced a new slogan--'New Era for a Green  Planet',
to show Taiwanese  motorcycle  manufacturers' commitment to environmental
protection, " Donald Lu, Executive vice president of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA), the main organizer of the exhibition, said in the
opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>A pavilion has also been set up at the exhibition to showcase Taiwan's fuel-
injection (FI) jet engine, which uses less fuel and reduces emission.</P>
      <P>"The FI jet engine makes the fuel consumption of the motorcycle more efficient,
so that reduces exhaust gas emission, " said a staff of the pavilion who
declined to be named, adding that an FI jet engine can reduce fuel consumption
by 10 percent compared to a combustion engine, the kind generally used at
present in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But consumers have to pay about NT$5,000-NT$8,000 more for the high tech engine,
he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government stipulated that all new motorcycles on the market must be
equipped with FI engines from 2009, to adapt to the fifth stage motorcycle
emission standard.</P>
      <P>The fifth stage emission standard, which was put into effect in July 2007 in
Taiwan, is one of the strictest motorcycle exhaust standards in the world,
according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>"In Taiwan's motorcycle industry, the supply chain is complete to include the
upper, middle and lower-stream business, from motorcycle components  to finished
products,  all of which are full of international market development potential,
" Eric S. H. Chiang, the deputy director of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs, told foreign and local buyers in his opening
remarks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's motorcycle show is the second largest one of its kind in Asia, after
only Tokyo's. The scale of the Taiwan show has been expanding year by year, with
an annual growth rate of 13 percent for manufacturers participating and 30
percent for the number of booths set up, organizers said.</P>
      <P>About 20,000 visitors are expected at the four-day show staged in the Taipei
World Trade Center this year, from April 9-12, with the first two days reserved
for buyers and the last two open to the general public.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the 6th largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world, according to
Chiang, after China, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Japan.</P>
      <P>A total of 481 booths  in the exhibition  are exhibiting motorcycles,  scooters,
engines, noise and emission inspection equipment, as well as maintenance
equipment and accessories.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Generation Y people born after 1981 tend to climb to managerial posts in
companies at a relatively much younger age than their older counterparts, a job
placement service center said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Employees born after 1980 tend to first become managers at an average age of
25.3, compared to 31.8 for their counterparts who were born in the 50s,
according to the 104 Job Bank, one of the country's largest human resource
service companies.</P>
      <P>In comparison, employees who were born in the 60s used to climb to managerial
positions at an average age of 29.5 and those who were born in the 70s usually
entered management for the first time at an average age of 27.4, according to
the results of a survey conducted by the job bank.</P>
      <P>The Y-generation people seem to climb the career ladder faster as they tend to
have stronger ability to learn and a stronger work ethic, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Most of the business executives said they do not particularly consider
employees' ages when they are choosing new leaders within their corporations,
the poll found.</P>
      <P>Negotiation and coordination ability, the ability to solve problems and
professional abilities are more important factors when they are considering
promotions, according to the poll.</P>

      <P>The 2008 Hakka Tung Blossom Festival will begin Thursday, with seven counties in
northern and central Taiwan presenting a variety of activities to celebrate the
annual flower season through the end of May.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs, Lee Yung-teh, who
heads the council, will hold a news conference Thursday to release detailed
information on where visitors can go to see the spectacular drifts of snow-white
flowers, as well the many activities reflecting Hakka culture in the counties of
Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, Taichung, Changhua and Nantou.</P>
      <P>April and May are the months when tung flowers, also known as paulownia flowers,
are in full bloom in central and northern Taiwan. The white flowers have become
a symbol of the Hakka people and the flowering season is celebrated in Hakka
villages every year with traditional music and song, coupled with the
consumption of Hakka delicacies.</P>
      <P>According to the Council for Hakka Affairs, 44 community groups in 25 cities and
townships will present over 100 artistic and cultural activities, while 92
outlets will market some 400 tung flower-related products and 78 designated
restaurants will provide Hakka dishes.</P>
      <P>The 2008 Tung Blossom Festival has been designated by the Tourism Bureau under
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications as one of the eight major
events of Tour Taiwan 2008-2009.</P>
      <P>The Hakka are a unique ethnic group of Han Chinese, who originally lived in
central China but gradually migrated south during different dynasties and
settled in Jiangxi, Fujian and Guangdong provinces, as well as in Taiwan, after
fleeing from war and famine. They were called Hakka, which literally means
"guest families," by the locals when they first settled in.</P>
      <P>The Hakka people are considered to be careful about maintaining their  cultural
traditions  and  one  of  their  outstanding characteristics is that they are
willing to venture into other parts of the world to establish themselves.</P>
      <P>During the 100 years, the Hakka have migrated to Southeast Asia, East Africa,
Europe and North and South America.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has about 4.5 million Hakka people, accounting for 13.2 percent of the
population. The first wave of Hakka migrants came from China to Taiwan in the
1690s, when China was under the rule of the Ching Dynasty.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first exposition on residential assets will start Sunday in the
northeastern county of Yilan to woo new residents to the area, Yilan County
Deputy Magistrate Lin Hsin-hua said at a news conference Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The exposition will take place at the Wu Lao Keng Mountain Stream Park in Yilan
County, and will run until May 18, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Participants will be able to obtain housing information and learn about the
different choices in Yilan County, including upscale residential areas and
suburban farm houses.</P>
      <P>The county government has designed outdoor exposition areas that would allow
participants to get a first hand experience of living in Yilan County.</P>
      <P>Deputy Magistrate Lin said Yilan is an attractive place to live because of its
natural environment, reasonable cost of housing, convenient transportation, and
high-quality medical center.</P>
      <P>It is also a good place to work, Lin said, adding that about 15,000 job
opportunities have been created in the last two years since the county attracted
95 investment projects.</P>
      <P>Chen Jung-sheng, chairman of the opto-electronics company Abon Touchsystems Co.,
encouraged young people, especially those from Yilan, to seek jobs in the county
to sustain the local economy. According to Chen, his company opened a plant in
Yilan in 2005 to provide jobs for young residents there.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, Lin conferred honorary county residency on Matthew Lien
-- a Canada-based musician known for his musical tributes to nature -- citing
Lien's musical exploration of Yilan County.</P>
      <P>"I am glad to become an honorary resident of the county which gave me a lot of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday that Taiwan has achieved steady
economic growth over the last eight years under the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) administration.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during a meeting of the Executive Yuan to review
the overall economic performance of the DPP during the two terms of its
administration.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Taiwan's economic growth averaged 4.1 percent between 2000 and
2007, and reached 5.23 percent in the last four years, higher than the 4.7
percent recorded by neighboring South Korea.</P>
      <P>The premier said that a series of economic development programs promoted by the
government, such as the 10 new major economic development projects and "mega-
investment and mega-warmth" plan, have borne fruit.</P>
      <P>He noted that annual private investment also increased to an average NT$1.63
trillion between 2000 and 2007, up NT$540.9 billion from the average NT$1.09
trillion between 1992 and 1999.</P>
      <P>"Private  investment  in 2007 surpassed  the NT$2 trillion threshold to reach
NT$2.04 billion," he added.</P>
      <P>Chang said that approved inbound investment averaged NT$7.14 billion between
2000 and 2007, or 2.6 times the figure of NT$2.74 billion recorded between 1992
and 1994.</P>
      <P>Approved inbound investment totaled NT$15.36 billion in 2007, setting a historic
record, Chang said.</P>
      <P>On the country's foreign trade performance, the premier said that imports and
exports increased to NT$219.3 billion and NT$246.7 billion, respectively, in
2007 from the NT$111.2 billion and NT$123.7 billion recorded respectively in
1999.</P>
      <P>Chang also noted that Taiwan's consumer price index registered an average growth
rate of only 0.89 percent between 2000 and 2007, and that growth was around 1.8
percent in 2007, comparatively lower than that registered in China, the United
States, South Korea and Singapore.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that the unemployment rate dropped to 3.9 percent in 2007 --
the lowest in seven years. An additional 909,000 jobs were created between 1999
and 2007, among them 665,000 for women, while women's labor participation rate
was as high as 49.4 percent, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local banks back fund to facilitate corporate loans</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five Taiwanese banks will join with the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to
establish a fund to build a platform that would streamline the assessment of
small and medium enterprises  (SME)  seeking financing,  the ministry  announced
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust  Commercial Bank,  Taiwan Corporate Bank,  First Commercial Bank, E.
Sun Bank, and Taipei Fubon Bank have agreed to contribute NT$5 million each, to
match the MOEA's input of NT$5 million, for the construction a NT$30-million
information facility that would provide all-in-one credit assessment for
commercial financing.</P>
      <P>The facility, an electronic financial service platform planned in 2004, will
compile financial reports on SMEs by using the e-Government  Services  Hub,  a
state-run  virtual platform to access the data of the business status and credit
status of Taiwan's private companies.</P>
      <P>The requirements for corporate loans are often stricter than for personal loans,
as the banks usually have to review a range of financial information such as
income tax and sales tax records, to determine a company's ability to repay a
loan.</P>
      <P>Greater transparency of companies' financial status will help lower the risk of
bad debts and subrogation costs incurred by the MOEA, which in some cases serves
as a guarantor, said a section chief of the Small and Medium Enterprise
Administration (SMEA) under the MOEA.</P>
      <P>"Once the banks are convinced that a company has the ability to repay a loan,
they would be more willing to offer financing, which in turn would help upgrade
the company's businesses," the official said. Financially stronger SMEs would
mean reduced tax levying by the Ministry of Finance, she added.</P>
      <P>The new mechanism will also make it easier and quicker for the country's SMEs to
obtain loans, as conventional procedures require a lot of paperwork and extra
time and costs.</P>
      <P>The new platform will incorporate hardware infrastructure and a software system.
The former will focus on a firewall to protect the companies' information, while
the latter will be an application to systemize the information required by the
banks.</P>
      <P>The MOEA section chief said no decision has yet been made regarding the sourcing
of the components.</P>
      <P>Referring to another MOEA project, the SME Credit Guarantee Fund, the official
said the ministry is offering a total of NT$5 billion in loan guarantees in
2008, and that some NT$37 billion had already been spent in credit guarantees
and subrogation fees to the banks since 2003.</P>
      <P>"The new platform and the credit guarantee fund could together help to improve
the financial capacity of Taiwan's SMEs, " she said.</P>

      <P>The 2008 Taipei International Auto Parts and Accessories Show kicked off
Wednesday morning, with a record high number of manufacturers setting up booths
at the event.</P>
      <P>A total of 937 automobile parts and accessories makers are taking part in the
four-day exhibition being held at the Taipei World Trade Center Nangang
Exhibition Hall. The figure represents a 13.6 percent increase over the previous
year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 2,494 booths have been set up at the show, also a record high,
marking a 30 percent increase over the number at last year's event.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the show, Hsieh Fa-da, deputy minister of economic
affairs, said that the record-high figures illustrate the Taiwan auto parts and
accessories industry's "unyielding strength."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that "Made in Taiwan" auto parts and accessories have become famous
around the world and "synonymous with innovative technology and high quality."</P>
      <P>"By means of a complete supply chain and their efforts at adding value to their
products,  Taiwan's auto parts and accessories manufacturers have been
successful in expanding their overseas markets," he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that the production value of Taiwan's auto parts and accessories
industry reached NT$153.9 billion (US$5.04 billion) in 2007, a year-on-year
increase of 2.7 percent, while the country's auto parts and accessories exports
amounted to NT$4.771 billion, up 11.3 percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>He said these figures illustrate the competitiveness of Taiwan's auto parts and
accessories makers.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said that if Taiwan's auto parts and accessories manufacturers can
maintain their distinct advantages as flexible and diversified suppliers and
continue investing in innovation, they will be able to preserve their
competitiveness in overseas markets.</P>
      <P>The 2008 Taipei International Auto Parts and Accessories Show was organized by
the Taiwan External Trade Development Council. Aside from Taiwanese suppliers,
manufacturers from 13 countries, including the United States, Japan, the United
Kingdom, India and Singapore, are taking part in the show.</P>
      <P>In addition, Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia have each set up booths to
showcase their respective auto parts and accessories industries at the
exhibition, which will run through April 12.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed Tuesday another serious case of
enterovirus -- Type 71 (EV 71) -- in southern Taiwan, bringing the number of
confirmed severe cases of enterovirus to 27 so far this year, with one casualty.</P>
      <P>The newest case is a one-year-old boy in the southern County of Pingtung, where
most of Taiwan's enterovirus cases were recorded in recent months.</P>
      <P>The boy developed a fever and pain in his throat March 27, and by March 29 was
vomiting and having spasms.</P>
      <P>He was sent to the intensive care unit of a medical center March 31 after he
developed pneumonia and muscle weakness.</P>
      <P>The boy, who has since been moved to an ordinary ward, is expected to be
discharged from the hospital soon.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-hao, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control under
the DOH, said that two confirmed cases of serious enterovirus are still being
treated in the pediatric intensive care unit -- an 8-month-old boy from Hsinchu
City and a 21-month-old girl from Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Chou said the enterovirus cases occurred earlier than expected this year, with
three-fourths of them recorded in the southern areas of Taiwan. According to
Chou, the epidemic usually reaches its peak between May and June, and between
September and October.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus usually enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract and
thrives there, and then moves on to attack the nervous system. It can be found
in the respiratory secretions and stool of an infected person.</P>
      <P>Chou reminded parents and teachers that frequent hand-washing is still the most
effective way to avoid contracting enterovirus.</P>

      <P>A Philippine governor on Tuesday called on the Chiayi city government and
visited the Chiayi Christian Hospital (CYCH) in an effort to enhance the
exchange of information on providing medical care.</P>
      <P>Sally Lee, governor of Sorsorgon Province in the southernmost Philippines, was
warmly welcomed by Chiayi Deputy Mayor Lee Hsi-chin and CYCH superintendent Chen
Cheng-ren, a CYCH spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee shared her views with Deputy Mayor Lee Hsi-chin and Chen on issues related
to upgrading the quality of health management and enhancing local infrastructure
development, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The visits came three years after Sorsogon Provincial Hospital and CYCH forged
sisterhood ties and a CYCH overseas medical team undertook a medical mission to
the Philippine hospital.</P>
      <P>Under the sponsorship of the Cabinet-level Department of Health and the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, in 2005, CYCH put together an overseas medical team, led by
its former superintendent Wong Juei-heng, to provide free medical services at
Sorsogon Provincial Hospital, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Due to a severe shortage of medical equipment and health care professionals in
the Philippines, most seniors in the country suffer from rheumatoid arthritis,
diabetes and gout, the spokesman noted.</P>
      <P>Thus, one of the main goals of the medical mission is to provide Filipinos with
information on dental, gastrointestinal and diabetic health care, and other
types of relevant information, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>"Through  the exchanges  between the two sister hospitals, Filipinos have
greatly benefited from Taiwan's medical technologies," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Medical personnel from Sorsogon Provincial Hospital have also attended seminars
and surgery demonstrations in Taiwan as part of the efforts to boost the quality
of medical care in the Philippines, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has approved a draft amendment to the Administrative Law of
State-Run Enterprise to allow state-run businesses to issue corporate bonds,
beyond the confines of the Company Act, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment will go into effect only after it has been passed by the
Legislative Yuan, Chang noted, urging the legislature to pass the bill as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>According to Article 247 of the Company Act, the total amount of corporate bonds
cannot exceed the net value of all assets possessed by a company after deducting
all liabilities and intangible assets, and the total amount of unsecured
corporate bonds should not exceed one-half of the net remainder.</P>
      <P>As state-run enterprises may be vulnerable because of their role in helping the
government stabilize the prices of commodities without raising the prices of
their own products, Chang said, "this has impeded the ability of the state-run
enterprises to raise funds."</P>
      <P>In recent months, state-run enterprises in Taiwan, such as oil refiner CPC Corp.
Taiwan and grid operator Taiwan Power Co., have frozen the prices of petroleum
and electricity in accordance with government policies, making it difficult for
them to raise funds under the terms of the current Administrative Law of State-
Run Enterprise.</P>
      <P>"The proposed amendment to the law would help the state-run enterprises to raise
funds and would also boost the nation's economic development on the whole,"
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said that personnel recruitment in state-run enterprises should
be done openly and transparently and should include the required "written test."</P>
      <P>"Matters  pertaining  to personnel  employment,  assessment, retirement, and
management within state-run enterprises should be drafted by each company and

      <P>The southern port city of Kaohsiung is on the alert for a possible outbreak of a
rodent-borne disease after the first case of native Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever
this year was reported.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health confirmed
Tuesday that a 26-year-old man who worked at a fish processing factory in
Kaohsiung's Cianjhen district was diagnosed with Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever on
March 38 after he complained of having a stomach ache, fever and diarrhea.</P>
      <P>The patient has recovered and was discharged from hospital three days after he
was admitted, according to a CDC statement.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director General Chou Chih-hau said a rat had been caught on the
grounds near the factory in Cianjhen where the man worked and that laboratory
tests were being conducted to determine whether the rat was carrying the virus..</P>
      <P>Hantavirus is found in the urine, saliva and droppings of infected city or field
rats and some other rodents. The diseases caused by the virus, including
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) , are listed in Taiwan as second-
degree infectious diseases that pose a moderate public health risk.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has reported 10 cases of Hantavirus since 2001, according to CDC data.</P>
      <P>The CDC said extermination of rats is the best way to prevent the disease since
people could become ill by inhaling virus-carrying dust, being bitten by rats,

chairman.</P>
      <P>The  proposed  appointment  of  Huang,  reportedly  on the recommendation  of
Chen Chin-jun,  has sparked criticism after opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Lee Ching-hua claimed that Huang had paid a bribe of NT$20 million
(US$655,737) to secure the position.</P>
      <P>Edward K. M. Chen, president of Taipower, said that it was likely he would be
forced to resign from his post because he did not endorse Huang's appointment.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs on Wednesday admonished him for opposing
Huang's appointment.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L. Chen revealed
during an interpellation at the Legislative Yuan that "he had been asked by Chen
Chin-jun to handle (Huang's appointment)."</P>
      <P>Rebutting the accusations that the vice chairmanship of Taiwpower could be
bought, the minister nonetheless ordered an investigation into the matter.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shieh insisted that Chen Chin-jun's recommendation of Huang was
"normal, " stressing that Chen Chin-jun did not know Huang personally and that
the government often receives recommendations from various sources whenever a
position is available.</P>
      <P>"As long as the person is competent, the Executive Yuan would consider the
recommendation," he added.</P>
      <P>Shieh, however, failed to elaborate on why Chen Chin-jun would recommend someone
he did not know for the Taipower post.</P>
      <P>"Decisions  regarding  recruitment  lie with  the personnel departments in the
state-run companies... and no one can manipulate the employment process," Shieh
said.</P>
      <P>Discounting Lee's accusations, Shieh said the lawmaker "should provide further
evidence in this matter instead of making indiscriminate statements."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH warns travelers to Vietnam to beware of cholera outbreak</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 9 (CNA)
04/09/08  22:40:09
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday urged people to be on the alert
during any trips to Vietnam, as 85 confirmed cases of cholera have been reported
in that country.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said
that with the increasing exchanges between Taiwan and Vietnam, people visiting
the Southeast Asian country should wash their hands frequently and refrain from
eating uncooked food.</P>
      <P>Chou said the cases of cholera, including fatalities, had been reported mainly
in 10 areas in northern Vietnam, including Hanoi and Hai Phong.</P>
      <P>Among the 85 confirmed cases, 44 people lived in Hanoi, all of whom reported
that they had eaten uncooked food or vegetables, Chou said, noting that
Vietnamese authorities had found vibrio cholerae, the bacteria that causes the
disease, in rivers, ponds and vegetables.</P>
      <P>He said that there have been no reported cases of cholera in Taiwan for two
consecutive years, and that there have been only chronic cases in the country
over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan business people are major investors in Vietnam and Vietnamese
nationals are the biggest group of foreign spouses in Taiwan, the DOH had to
issue the warning, Chou added.</P>
      <P>Cholera is an acute type of gastroenteritis caused by the bacterium Vibrio
cholerae. The bacterial infection of the small intestines can be mild with no
symptoms, but in severe cases it can cause massive diarrhea, vomiting and leg
cramps. Approximately one in 20 infected persons develop the severe form of the
disease and the rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock.
Without treatment, death can occur within hours, as cholera is one of the most
rapidly fatal illnesses known.</P>

      <P>A legislator of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) asked the Ministry of Justice
Wednesday to investigate why a container security program at the southern
seaport of Kaohsiung, aimed at preventing weapons of mass destruction from
reaching U.S. territory, should be carried out at Taiwan's expense.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lu Hsiu-yen reminded Chien Liang-chi, head of the Directorate General
of Customs under the Ministry of Finance, at a legislative session that the
container security program at Kaohsiung harbor is not based on the principal of
reciprocity, nor on mutual respect for sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Chien admitted  earlier  to another  KMT legislator,  Liao Cheng-ching, that
about 10 U.S. officials are currently stationed in the port city for the anti-
terrorism  program,  and that the Directorate General of Customs had paid for
the container X-ray facilities.</P>
      <P>Chien said the two large imaging machines purchased in 2005 for NT$180 million
(US$5.9 million) turned out to be unusable, and that two other advanced machines
acquired in October 2007 for NT$240 million are still not in use after
undergoing test runs.</P>
      <P>Lu criticized the Ministry of Finance for wasting public funds and allowing the
nation's sovereignty to be infringed upon by another country. She urged the
Ministry of Justice to investigate the inappropriate spending.</P>
      <P>In 2002 after the 9-11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection
proposed the Container Security Initiative aimed at ensuring that all containers
that could pose a potential risk of terrorism are identified and inspected at
foreign ports before they are destined for the Unite States.</P>
      <P>The program has stationed multidisciplinary teams of officers to work with host
foreign government counterparts  to target and prescreen containers,  using
automated facilities and radiation detection devices at major seaports around
the world.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the first imported cluster cases of
dengue fever discovered in a family Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said
the patients were four children born to a Tongese mother who was married to a
Taiwanese man living in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Chou said the mother took her four children to visit Tonga, a South Pacific
island nation near New Zealand, and brought the children back to Taiwan on March
24.</P>
      <P>Her 4-year-old son was detected to have fever at the airport and was confirmed
to have been infected with the mosquito-borne disease.</P>
      <P>Taipei County health authorities then took specimen from the mother and her
three daughters aged 8, 10, 13. Tests confirmed that the three sisters were also
infected, although the mother was not.</P>
      <P>But "only one sister showed the symptom of fever on March 28, and the two others
had no symptoms," Chou said, adding that all four children recovered after
taking medicine.</P>
      <P>The centers estimated that there have been 24 imported dengue fever cases so far
this year, compared with only 15 imported cases during the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>Among the 24 cases, 10 were from Indonesia, four each were from the Philippines
and Tonga, three from Vietnam, one each from India and Malaysia and the source
of another case was unclear.</P>
      <P>Chou said that dengue fever outbreaks were reported in Southeast Asia and the
South Pacific with fatalities this year, urging the public to take precautionary
measures against mosquito bites when traveling to those countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP chairman urges younger generation to run for chairmanship</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Frank Hsieh is encouraging
younger party members to run for the party chairmanship in the election
scheduled for May 18, a DPP official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan, quoting Hsieh's remarks during a regular
meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee, said the chairman  encouraged
the young  people  to "take up the responsibility, as whoever takes over the
post will face a tough task ahead."</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the party has been in disarray since it suffered two major
setbacks in the Jan. 12 legislative elections and the March 22 presidential
poll.</P>
      <P>Hsieh has invited more members, especially those under 50, to register for the
party chairmanship election, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said that, in accordance with DPP election guidelines, consultations will be
held among the hopefuls after the registration process, and if a leader is not
selected, then an election will be held.</P>
      <P>The DPP will hold an event May 10 for hopefuls to present their platforms, and
will invite young people to raise questions, in an effort to involve younger
party members in the process, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing, one of the seven local DPP heads in
southern Taiwan, said that it is best to produce a party chairman through
consultation, and suggested that former Presidential Office Secretary-General
Chen Shih-meng is one of the best candidates.</P>
      <P>"An election is likely to lead to protracted squabbling and that could extend
the time it would take the DPP to regain power," Yang said.</P>
      <P>To date, no one within the DPP has openly expressed an intention to run for the
chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said during a meeting with the media Tuesday night that the party should
pass the baton to the younger generation, suggesting that Presidential Office
Deputy Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung and former DPP legislator Lo Wen-jia
should throw their hats into the ring.</P>
      <P>"Those city and county chiefs who will step down at the end of next year are
also potential candidates," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>On the future of the party, Hsieh said that the incoming Kuomintang (KMT)
administration would be happy to see the DPP and other parties splinter into
three or four equally weak groups so that it could maintain its grip on the
power for a long time.</P>
      <P>But he also said that after the KMT takes over, it will face problems  as the
electorate  in the urban areas  will become discontented and will complain.</P>
      <P>The city and county chief election in late 2009 is a major poll, but it is not
expected to result in much change, he said, adding that the more crucial
elections will be the presidential and legislative polls in four years' time.</P>
      <P>As for his future plans, Hsieh, 62, said that he has been dedicated to the
democratic movement since he was in his 30s, and that the younger generation
should now lead the party.</P>
      <P>Having served as premier and Kaohsiung mayor, Hsieh said, he is very familiar
with government operations and budgets.</P>
      <P>"I will use my experience to help monitor the government via the Internet," he
added.</P>

terrorism  program,  and that the Directorate General of Customs had paid for
the container X-ray facilities.</P>
      <P>Chien said the two large imaging machines purchased in 2005 for NT$180 million
(US$5.9 million) turned out to be unusable, and that two other advanced machines
acquired in October 2007 for NT$240 million are still not in use after
undergoing test runs.</P>
      <P>Lu criticized the Ministry of Finance for wasting public funds and allowing the
nation's sovereignty to be infringed upon by another country. She urged the
Ministry of Justice to investigate the inappropriate spending.</P>
      <P>In 2002 after the 9-11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection
proposed the Container Security Initiative aimed at ensuring that all containers
that could pose a potential risk of terrorism are identified and inspected at
foreign ports before they are destined for the Unite States.</P>
      <P>The program has stationed multidisciplinary teams of officers to work with host
foreign government counterparts  to target and prescreen containers,  using
automated facilities and radiation detection devices at major seaports around
the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH warns travelers to Vietnam to beware of cholera outbreak</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 9 (CNA)
04/10/08  11:44:14
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday urged people to be on the alert
during any trips to Vietnam, as 85 confirmed cases of cholera have been reported
in that country.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said
that with the increasing exchanges between Taiwan and Vietnam, people visiting
the Southeast Asian country should wash their hands frequently and refrain from
eating uncooked food.</P>
      <P>Chou said the cases of cholera, including fatalities, had been reported mainly
in 10 areas in northern Vietnam, including Hanoi and Hai Phong.</P>
      <P>Among the 85 confirmed cases, 44 people lived in Hanoi, all of whom reported
that they had eaten uncooked food or vegetables, Chou said, noting that
Vietnamese authorities had found vibrio cholerae, the bacteria that causes the
disease, in rivers, ponds and vegetables.</P>
      <P>He said that there have been no reported cases of cholera in Taiwan for two
consecutive years, and that there have been only chronic cases in the country
over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan business people are major investors in Vietnam and Vietnamese
nationals are the biggest group of foreign spouses in Taiwan, the DOH had to
issue the warning, Chou added.</P>
      <P>Cholera is an acute type of gastroenteritis caused by the bacterium Vibrio
cholerae. The bacterial infection of the small intestines can be mild with no
symptoms, but in severe cases it can cause massive diarrhea, vomiting and leg
cramps. Approximately one in 20 infected persons develop the severe form of the
disease and the rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock.
Without treatment, death can occur within hours, as cholera is one of the most
rapidly fatal illnesses known.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian proposed Thursday that the government work with the
private sector to map out a bicycle path network around Taiwan to help make
cycling a national sport.</P>
      <P>Chen raised the issue in an article published in the latest issue of his online
newsletter, in which he commented on Earth Day, which falls on April 22.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the world is paying increasing attention to Earth Day, as global
warming has adversely impacted on the environment and the earth's ecological
system in recent years.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, bicycles, which do not produce carbon dioxide, has become
a popular means of transport in many European countries, such as the
Netherlands, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although there is an increasing number of people in Taiwan who ride bicycles to
work and enjoy cycling as a pastime on weekends, cycling is still not as popular
in Taiwan as in Europe, the United States and Japan, he said.</P>
      <P>"Cycling would become more popular if the government and the private sector
could be more creative," he said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that some people in Taiwan recently completed a cycling tour around
the island, the president suggested that senior high school students be
encouraged to make a round-the-island cycling trip before they graduate.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, such a tour will not only provide an opportunity for the
students to test their patience and willpower, but will also allow them to
become more familiar with the land in which they live and to recognize the
importance of protecting the environment and the ecological system.</P>

      <P>The Fair Trade Commission fined the local construction company RSL Architecture
NT$5.5 million (US$180,328) Thursday for misleading consumers with an
advertisement for real estate showing residential buildings on land specified
for industrial use.</P>
      <P>The RSL commercial advertisement shows spaces such as living rooms and kitchens
superimposed on a blueprint of the land, an image that could lead potential
buyers to think that the property could be used for residential purposes,
according to FTC Commissioner Chou Ya-shu.</P>
      <P>This advertisement could cost buyers considerable trouble because the
construction of any residential buildings on the property would be illegal and
the owners may be forced to redesign or even demolish the buildings,said Chou at
a press conference.</P>
      <P>The FTC will also order the company to revise the advertisement, which is in
violation of the Fair Trade Law, she indicated.</P>
      <P>The FTC cautioned that investors should ensure that any land they purchase can
be legally developed as intended, especially as Taiwan's real estate is likely
to become more popular thanks to the incoming government's promise to allow
Chinese buyers to purchase property in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Buyers need to watch out for potential risks in case some companies try to take
(illegal) advantage of the anticipated higher demand,said Brain Chang, an FTC
section chief.</P>
      <P>The FTC said there had been no response from RSL to the fine, to date, but that
the company might appeal for a reversal of the FTC ruling.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Civil Service Act, former civil servants are banned from

    <TEXT>
      <P>Far Eastern Air Transport (FAT) , one of the local airlines that have been hard
hit by a downturn in domestic air travel, said Thursday it regretted that a
proposal by a potential investor to give it a much needed shot in the arm had
not taken off.</P>
      <P>Shih Chien-hua, an FAT planning manager, made the remarks after learning that
the Kinmen County Council had voted earlier in the day -- 10-6, with two
abstentions -- to turn down a proposal by county government-owned Kinmen
Kaoliang Liquor Inc. (KKL) to invest in FAT.</P>
      <P>Shih however added that an FAT shareholders' meeting will take place as
scheduled Friday and that the meeting is expected to pass a proposal to increase
the airline's capital to ease its dire financial situation.</P>
      <P>Shih said that two vacant board director seats are also expected to be filled
during the meeting. The board will then contact interested parties on the
possibility of investment, he said.</P>
      <P>He declined to identify the potential investors, saying only that "they are from
home and abroad."</P>
      <P>KKL's new chairwoman, former legislator Joanna Lei, contacted FAT last month
with a proposal to inject between NT$2.2 billion (US$66.58 million) and NT$2.75
billion into the company in exchange for a 40 percent stake.</P>
      <P>Lei said she was hoping that the investment would benefit Kinmen, which lies
closer to China than to Taiwan, and help to provide its residents with more
convenient transportation options.</P>
      <P>Upon learning that the KKL investment proposal had been rejected, both Lei and
Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng said they "respect the majority decision by the
county council."</P>
      <P>KKL, which is run by the Kinmen local government, enjoys an annual turnover of
more than NT$11 billion, with its famous sorghum liquor enjoying the largest
domestic market share in the white rum business.</P>
      <P>FAT, Taiwan's oldest privately owned airline, celebrated its 50th anniversary in
November 2007. Its financial crisis first came to light in February when a fuel
payment check for NT$151 million bounced and it was disclosed that FAT was also
unable to pay its landing fees.</P>
      <P>The airline filed for bankruptcy protection Feb. 15 after reporting debts of
NT$9.99 billion at the end of September 2007.</P>
      <P>It won a 90-day stay in bankruptcy from the Taipei District Court Feb. 22. Since
then the airline has been seeking investors willing to take over its huge debts.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that, so far, 17 of
Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies had confirmed that they would be represented at
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration ceremony May 20, setting a new
record.</P>
      <P>"It is a very good sign that 17 heads of state and vice presidents have already
committed to attending the inauguration ceremony, which shows a high degree of
goodwill and is a very positive development, " Foreign Minister James Huang said
after briefing President-elect Ma and Vice President-elect Vincent Siew on
Taiwan's current diplomatic circumstances.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee of
the Legislative Yuan, MOFA's Deputy Minister Yang Tzu-pao  also  said that one
king,  eight  presidents,  three governor-generals, two prime ministers and
three vice presidents had confirmed that they would attend the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The leaders are the king of Swaziland; the presidents of Palau, Kiribati, the
Marshall Islands, Burkina Faso, Sao Tome and Principe, Honduras, El Salvador,
and Paraguay; the governor-generals of the Solomon Islands, Saint Kitts and
Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines; the prime ministers of Tuvalu and
Belize; and the vice presidents of the Gambia, Guatemala and Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>"The ceremony will be simple and solemn and will be held in accordance with
diplomatic protocol," Yang said.</P>
      <P>He told the CNA that the number of foreign dignitaries scheduled to attend
President-elect Ma's inauguration is "more than at previous inaugurations,
setting a historic record," and that many other countries that do not have
diplomatic ties with Taiwan will also send envoys and delegates to the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Regarding speculations that the United States might send a high- ranking
official to attend the ceremony as a salve following its rejection of Ma's
request to visit the U.S. before taking office, Yang did not respond directly,
saying only that the MOFA hopes countries, with or without diplomatic relations
with Taiwan, would send high-ranking officials.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Lai Shyh-pao said he hoped the MOFA would do its best to
invite dignitaries like former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the May 20 inauguration. Yang said anything is
possible and the MOFA will do all that it can.</P>
      <P>Ma's decisive victory on March 22 was welcomed by the international community,
and many countries, even those without diplomatic ties to Taiwan, have
congratulated Ma with high hopes that relations between Taiwan and China will
improve.</P>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush also issued a statement right after the election
to congratulate Ma, and praised Taiwan as a beacon of democracy in Asia.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking official in charge of public construction  said Thursday that the
planned government subsidies to contractors of public construction project
should be decided by the incoming government to be inaugurated May 20.</P>
      <P>Lee Wu-hsiung,  vice chairman of the Cabinet-level  Public Construction
Commission (PCC) , made the remarks at a meeting with a group of petitioners led
by Pan Chun-jung, chairman of the Taiwan Regional Engineering Contractors
Association (TRECA) , who mobilized thousands of builders to protest against the
government's failure to offer them subsidies amid soaring construction material
prices.</P>
      <P>Lee said that as the issue will involve huge sums of money, the PCC will leave
the decision  to the incoming  government  of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>The TRECA also launched a one-day strike Thursday demanding that the government
fulfill a promise it made before the March 22 presidential election to subsidize
builders of public construction projects in light of the increasing prices of
building materials.</P>
      <P>Many builders complained that they can hardly survive at a time when the cost of
almost all construction materials has risen, and some even claimed that they
were losing money even though business had increased.</P>
      <P>According to the builders' estimates, Thursday's strike will cost them some 2
billion (US$65.8 million).</P>
      <P>Pan claimed that the PCC and TRECA had reached a consensus before the
presidential election that the government would lower the subsidy threshold from
2.5 percent of construction material price hikes, and had agreed that the
subsidies would be granted if the price increases exceeded 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>For some specific items, the PCC promised to lower the threshold from 10 percent
to 2.5 percent, according to Pan.</P>

matter to the incoming government at a time when many public construction
projects remained idle as builders do not want to bid for them and the

    <HEADLINE>Heightened alert urged against Kawasaki disease</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10 (CNA)
04/10/08  18:26:47
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pediatricians called Thursday for a heightened alert in Taiwan this season
against the occurrence of Kawasaki disease, an illness that often strikes young
children under the age of five.</P>
      <P>Kawasaki disease, also known as lymph node syndrome or Kawasaki syndrome, is a
leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in Japan, South Korea, and
Taiwan, as well as in children in the rest of the world of oriental extraction,
said Lu Hung-chi, executive director of the Cardiac Children's Foundation
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Children, particularly those under five living in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan,
are prone to Kawasaki disease in the months between April and June every year,
Lu said in a speech delivered at the Ninth International Kawasaki Disease
Symposium that opened at the Grand Hotel in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>First described in 1967 by Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki in Japan, the disease is a
poorly understood self-limited vasculitis that affects many organs, including
the skin and mucous membranes, lymph nodes, blood vessel walls, and the heart.</P>
      <P>Lu said that parents and pediatricians should pay extra attention if children in
their care have a fever for more than five days and show other symptoms such as
a rash, swollen hands and feet, red eyes, swollen lymph glands in the neck, and
irritation and inflammation of the mouth, lips and throat.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, about 66 out of every 100,000 children under five have been affected
by Kawasaki disease, compared to 188 in Japan and 105 in South Korea, Lu said.</P>
      <P>He said that the number of Kawasaki disease cases in Taiwan has gradually
increased over the past 10 years, with 800 to 1,000 cases being diagnosed
annually in the last two years.</P>
      <P>"In the absence of proper treatment, as many as 20-30 percent of the children
with Kawasaki disease could suffer complications that affect the heart, " Lu
said. "Their coronary arteries and heart muscles could be damaged."</P>
      <P>Doctors still do not know what causes Kawasaki disease, but it appears not to be
hereditary or contagious. Researchers who have studied the illness think
evidence strongly suggests that is caused by an infectious agent such as a
virus. It is very rare for more than one child in a family to develop Kawasaki
disease and less than 2 percent of children have a repeat attack.</P>
      <P>Wu Mei-huan, a leading pediatrician at National Taiwan University Hospital, said
at the symposium that Kawasaki disease is not easily diagnosed, as many of its
symptoms are similar to those of flu.</P>
      <P>"Doctors are encouraged to use endocardiography to diagnose the little patient,
if a child presents with four to five symptoms of typical Kawasaki disease," Wu
added.</P>
      <P>Even though the cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown, certain medicines are
known to help, according to members of the Cardiac Children's Foundation Taiwan.
Aspirin is often used to reduce fever, rash, joint inflammation and pain, and to
help prevent blood clots. Another treatment, intravenous gamma globulin, can
help decrease the risk of developing coronary artery abnormalities if
administered during the early stages of the illness, they said.</P>
      <P>Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki was at the opening of the symposium Thursday, which also
brought together 27 leading pediatricians from around the world.</P>
      <P>A total of 274 research papers by specialists from 20 countries are expected to
be read or presented during the three-day symposium.</P>

    <HEADLINE>All four commercial harbors ready for direct cross-strait links</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The heads of Taiwan's four commercial ports said unanimously Thursday that they
are ready for direct cross-strait transportation links between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>They were responding to questions by Legislator Yang Chiung-ying of the
Kuomintang at a legislative committee meeting regarding whether they have made
adequate preparations for the links.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou declared recently that he would open full direct
cross-strait transportation links between Taiwan and mainland China after he
assumes office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Keelung Harbor Bureau Director-General Hsiao Ting-hsun said there will be no
difficulty for the harbor in northern Taiwan to deal with cross-strait
transportation, noting that "all is set."</P>
      <P>Taichung Harbor Bureau Director-General Lee Lung-wen said that the harbor in
central Taiwan was ready nine years ago, and "is waiting for the government to
give the green light."</P>
      <P>Lee also said that the harbor has conducted a test, which showed that four
vessels could navigate the harbor within two hours. He ADDED THAT an estimated
4,000 passengers can travel through the port each day.</P>
      <P>Taichung currently allows direct cross-strait transportation links during
religious festivals to ease travel, such as for followers of Matsu, a revered
sea goddess in Taiwan and China, so they can directly travel through the harbor
to China without having to go through a third destination.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau Director-General Hsieh Ming-hui said that as an
international harbor, the harbor in southern Taiwan is ready to accept
passengers and cargoes from all corners of the world.</P>
      <P>Hualien Harbor Bureau Director-General Wang Chung-hsiung said with confidence
that the harbor in eastern Taiwan is "all ready."</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma has said that he would open Taiwan to direct cross-strait
transportation links and allow 3,000 Chinese tourists to come to Taiwan daily
after July 1.</P>
      <P>Currently, due to sour relations between China and the current Taiwanese
administration, only direct "mini" links are allowed between Taiwan's outlying
islands and a few cities in China's Fujian province and only certain people
qualify to take those convenient routes.</P>
      <P>Direct chartered flights between Taiwan and China are allowed only on special
holidays to enable Taiwanese business people and their families to easily return
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Most others who want to travel from Taiwan to China and back must go through a
third destination - usually Hong Kong.</P>

      <P>All three U.S. presidential candidates have extended congratulations to
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou on his March 22 election win, a ranking official of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama of the Democratic
Party and Republican John McCain have all offered congratulations to Ma and Vice
President-elect Vincent Siew in public statements made on the campaign trail,
said Christine Hsueh, deputy director-general of the MOFA Department of North
American Affairs.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered in Chicago March 22, Obama said that he offered his
congratulations to Ma and best wishes for his presidency.</P>
      <P>"The people of Taiwan deserve our respect and admiration for this free and fair
election,  which  is just the latest  step in consolidating a democracy that has
advanced over the last two decades," Obama said.</P>
      <P>"I hope the People's Republic of China responds to this election in a positive,
constructive and forward-leaning way. It is important for Beijing to demonstrate
to the people of Taiwan that the practical and non-confrontational approach that
President-elect Ma promises to take toward the Mainland will be met with good
faith and progress, " he said.</P>
      <P>Obama said the PRC should reduce the military threat to Taiwan by drawing back
the missiles it has deployed in southeast China and by other security
confidence-building measures.</P>
      <P>He said on issues such as Taiwan's observer status in the World Health
Organization, where the health of all Chinese people is at stake, it should
allow Taiwan greater international space.</P>
      <P>"The United States should respond to Ma Ying-jeou's election by rebuilding  a
relationship  of trust and support for Taiwan's democracy. The U.S. should
reopen blocked channels of communication with Taiwan officials. We should
continue to provide the arms necessary for Taiwan to deter possible aggression,"
he said.</P>
      <P>At a regular press conference Thursday, Hsueh said the White House and the U.S.
Department of State had offered congratulations to Ma and Siew almost
immediately after the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ticket won the poll.</P>
      <P>A total of 56 members of the U.S. Congress have also extended congratulations to
Ma and Siew, either by sending congratulatory letters or in open statements,
Hsueh added.</P>
      <P>She noted that the 56 members included leaders of the Congress such as Speaker
of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) , Senate Majority Leader
Harry Reid (D-Nev.) , Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) , and House
Republican Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).</P>
      <P>In addition, she said, three state governors and three deputy governors, as well
as speakers of many state assemblies have also sent congratulatory messages to
Ma and Siew on the KMT's victory.</P>
      <P>On the question of who might represent Washington at Ma's inauguration on May
20, Hsueh said the U.S. government has yet to make a final decision.</P>
      <P>The United States sent a delegation to Taiwan to attend the presidential
inauguration ceremonies in 2000 and 2004.</P>

      <P>A carnival celebrating Songkran Festival--or the Thai New Year--will take place
this weekend in Kaohsiung  County to help foreign workers from Thailand  ease
homesickness, an activity organizer said at a news conference Thursday.</P>
      <P>The carnival, to be jointly organized by governments of Kaohsiung County,
Kaohsiung City, and Pingtung County in southern Taiwan, will be held at the
Kaohsiung County's Labor Recreation Center from April 13-15. It will mark the
first time for the the three local governments to hold such an activity.
Kaohsiung County held its first such carnival last year alone, drawing 1,000
participants.</P>
      <P>According to Sung Ting-tung, director of Kaohsiung County's Labor Affairs
Bureau, the Songkran Festival is celebrated every year in Thailand from April
13-15.</P>
      <P>To celebrate Thailand's most joyful holiday, Thai people splash water and put
scented powder on each other to express hopes of ridding bad luck and praying
for blessings, Sung said, adding that the festival is also celebrated in many
other Southeast Asian countries, such as Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar, as well as
by the Dai people in Yunnan, China.</P>
      <P>Activities designed for the carnival in Kaohsiung include water splashing,  a
band performance,  traditional  Thai dance,  and traditional dance from the
Philippines, Sung said.</P>
      <P>Nearly 5,000 people have signed up for the carnival, he added.</P>
      <P>Sung noted that Taiwan has more than 9,800 temporary workers from Thailand, and
most of Kaohsiung County's more than 1,300 foreign workers are from Thailand.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is the top choice in terms of working destination for workers from
Thailand,  " said Sung.</P>
      <P>Directors of the three government's  labor affairs bureaus Thursday invited all
foreign workers and local residents to join the carnival to gain a better
understanding of the traditional Thai culture.</P>
      <P>A similar activity will take place in Taipei City in northern Taiwan on April
12, according to an official of Taipei City government's Department of Labor.</P>
      <P>In addition to water splashing, there will be dance performances by a group from
Thailand-based Faculty of Fine Art, Srinakharinwirot University, as well as
performances by popular bands formed by Thai workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Muay Thai--Thai boxing, singing contests, lottery drawing, and delicacies
presentation will also be featured at the carnival.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NGOs call for more comprehensive policy on Chinese spouses</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two non-governmental organizations are urging the incoming government to adopt
more comprehensive policies regarding Chinese spouses in Taiwan, to augment the
immigrants right to work and streamline the process of applying for residence.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who won a decisive victory in the March 22
presidential election, campaigned on a platform of more open and closer
relations between Taiwan and China,  a significant departure from the position
of the current Democratic Progressive Party government.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the incoming government will pay greater attention to the rights
of Chinese spouses, " said Ke Yu-ling, executive director of the Pearl S. Buck
Foundation,  a non-governmental organization that helps foreign spouses and
their children to adapt to life in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The government should take into consideration the immediate needs of Chinese
spouses, and give attention to issues such as the right to work and a simpler
process of obtaining a Taiwan identity card, " Ke told the Central News Agency.
She further called for the Immigration Act and the regulations on resident
permit applications to be amended.</P>
      <P>Chinese spouses, in most cases, have to wait five to eight years to obtain
Taiwan nationality,  longer than spouses from other countries, who can apply for
resident status after about three years and are allowed to work almost as soon
as they arrive in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She suggested that Chinese spouses should at least be treated the same as other
foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) officially announced in early April that
Chinese spouses of Taiwanese citizens who have minor children will be allowed to
work even if they do not yet have residence status.</P>
      <P>About 10,000 Chinese spouses  will benefit  under the new regulation, according
to the CLA.</P>
      <P>Describing the new measure as "a step forward," Lin Ying-zhen, the director of
the section of aid and service of the Chinese Association for Relief and
Ensuring Services, said that the government has been paying increasingly greater
attention to the voices of new immigrants.</P>
      <P>She added, however, that the government should provide alternative access to
information for Chinese people who are marrying Taiwanese citizens, as most
official Taiwan Web sites are blocked in China.</P>
      <P>Of the 400,000 foreign spouses living in Taiwan, some 250,000 are from China,
according to the Ministry of the Interior.</P>

      <P>A campaign to "deliver love to every corner  of Taiwan"  kicked off Thursday  in
Taipei  with the participation of dignitaries and officials, including Chu Shu-
hsian, the wife of Vice President-elect Vincent Siew, and Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-
bin.</P>
      <P>The program invites the public to contribute articles to express their love in
an attempt to "influence society with people's love." The best articles will be
chosen by experts and the winning writers awarded prizes of between NT$100,000
(US$3,278) and NT$1,000.</P>
      <P>Pai Hsueh-hua, better known by her stage name Pai Ping-ping, who is founder and
chairwoman of the event's organizer -- the Pai Hsieh-yen Cultural and
Educational Foundation (PCEF) -- said at the launch ceremony  that even though
social order in Taiwan is unsatisfactory, "love is still observed in many
places."</P>
      <P>She urged the public "to treasure what they have, to write stories about love
and to spread their love to others."</P>
      <P>The PCEF was founded in 1997 by Pai, a well-known local singer and actress,
after her only daughter, Pai Hsieh-yen, was abducted and murdered.</P>
      <P>Following the establishment of the PCEF, the foundation has devoted itself to
creating a society in which people can live in peace and enjoy their work, as
well as helping children in Taiwan grow up safely.</P>
      <P>Commending Pai as a brave woman in overcoming tragedy and throwing herself to
social work, Chu said that "only love can let us live happily."</P>
      <P>"Let's do good things, say good words and make our society a peaceful one," Chu
said.</P>
      <P>Hau  praised  Pai  for  her achievements  in helping  the underprivileged and
urged the public "to work together and use love to solve the obstacles around
us."</P>
      <P>The PCEF started accepting entries April 10 and will continue to accept them

      <P>Formosan black bears, the only bear species endemic to Taiwan, forage around the
areas near Jade Mountain following the fruit bearing season of a specific kind
of oak tree, according to a recent study conducted by local zoologists.</P>
      <P>Formosan black bear, or ursus thibetanus formosanus, is a subspecies of the
Asiatic black bear. The species, the largest mammal in Taiwan, usually inhabits
forest areas at elevations between 1,000 meters and 3,500 meters.</P>
      <P>Scientists believe that the bears leave their domain only when the food supply
becomes scarce.</P>
      <P>The zoologists, who have closely observed the black bear's activities for nearly
a decade, reported Wednesday that the number of bears in the region laced with
ring-cupped oaks always rises sharply from October to January, corresponding
with the period when acorns are produced.</P>
      <P>Hwang Mei-hsiu,  assistant  professor  at National Pingtung University of
Science and Technology and leader of the project, said the average bear
population in the neighborhood between October and January is around 1.5 times
that in February to September.</P>
      <P>"Bears usually begin to arrive by late-October, and leave gradually after acorns
become scarce; when there is no nuts at all, the bears disappear entirely as
well, " said Hwang during a thesis presentation organized by the Yushan National
Park Administration, the supervising agency for the areas neighboring Jade
Mountain (Yushan in Chinese).</P>
      <P>Hwang, nicknamed "Mother Black Bear" for her contribution to the understanding
and conservation of the endangered species, said during the years when ring-
cupped oaks produce less fruits, the bears would more likely invade human
territories to seek food supply.</P>
      <P>Animal researchers suggested that the acorn production volume can be recognized
as an index of the aggressiveness of wild black bears in October-January.</P>
      <P>They also suggested that when the nut supply is expected to decrease in the
year, an advanced warning could be issued to caution residents or tourists in
the area of the danger of bears prowling activities.</P>

      <P>Just withdrawing, instead of destroying, half of the missiles that China has
deployed along its coastal provinces aimed at Taiwan is not good enough, Defense
Minister Tsai Ming-hsien said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to members of the print media, Tsai said he has no idea about the
veracity of speculations circulating in the local stock market that Chinese
President Hu Jintao plans to give President-elect Ma Ying-jeou an impressive
gift on his May 20 inauguration by announcing that China will withdraw half of
the missiles.</P>
      <P>Whether the speculation is true or not, the United Evening News said it caused
the TAIEX weighted index to surge 161.47 points, or 1.86 percent, to close at
8,829.4, a record high in 11 trading days.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that since most of China's missiles are mobile, withdrawing them would
make little sense, as they could very easily be moved back into place at a later
date.</P>
      <P>"If China truly wants to demonstrate its goodwill toward Taiwan, it should first
destroy some of the missiles targeting Taiwan and work out a timetable for such
destruction," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lo Chih-chiang, a spokesman for Ma's campaign office, said the office
has received no information on the issue and therefore refused to speculate on
the report.</P>

      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) criticized
Thursday President-elect Ma Ying- jeou's remarks that Taiwan should continue to
apply for observer status in the World Health Assembly (WHA) under the name
Chinese Taipei, describing it as a backward-moving strategy, the result of which
will be the responsibility of the outgoing government.</P>
      <P>"I strongly oppose applying for observer status in the WHA under the name
Chinese Taipei, as it would be a step backward, " DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin said
during a session of the legislature's Foreign Affairs and National Defense
Committee.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Taiwan does not have to deceive itself, as the membership application
is doomed to fail again this year. She added that "we cannot make concessions in
advance, as the incumbent government will have to take the blame for the result
of the bid."</P>
      <P>The upcoming WHA -- the World Health Organization's (WHO's) decision-making body
-- which is scheduled to open May 19 in Geneva, one day before Ma's
inauguration, is seen in some political quarters as likely to be the first
crucial test of the relationship between China and Ma's new administration.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister James Huang reiterated  Thursday  that no conclusion has been
reached on how to handle Taiwan's bid for its participation in the WHO this year
but said the Foreign Ministry will continue to communicate with Ma's office.</P>
      <P>"The issue is pending discussions among relevant agencies and the government
will communicate with Ma's office on the basis of mutual respect, " he said
after briefing Ma and Vice President-elect Vincent Siew on Taiwan's present
diplomatic circumstances.</P>
      <P>Ma signaled his intention April 4 to employ pragmatism and flexibility in his
foreign policy -- which he described as "modus vivendi " -- saying that Chinese
Taipei is an acceptable name for Taiwan to use in international organizations, a
suggestion that represents a significant departure from the position of the
outgoing DPP administration.</P>
      <P>Since it began seeking representation at the WHA in 1997, Taiwan's annual
attempts have been thwarted by Beijing. Last year, it applied for membership of
the WHO for the first time under the name Taiwan but failed due to opposition
from China, which claims Taiwan as its territory.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's expulsion from the United Nations and affiliated organizations in
1971, it has been isolated from major international activities and at present
has formal diplomatic relations with only 23 countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA to promote vegetarianism: EPA minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Minister Chen Chung-hsin said
Thursday that his agency will promote vegetarianism in an effort to counter
global warming.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a meeting of the Health, Environment and Social Welfare
Committee of the legislature, where he explained the government's policy on
reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Hung-chih of the opposition Kuomintang, who was also present at
the interpellation session, asked why the EPA has not promoted vegetarianism as
a way to fight global warming.</P>
      <P>According to information collected by Lin, producing one kilo of beef (from
breeding to selling) will produce 76.4 kg of carbon dioxide, as the transport
process requires refrigerated planes and trucks.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the livestock  industry depends heavily on pastures, the creation
of which causes shrinkage of forests worldwide and thus accelerates global
warming.</P>
      <P>While producing animal products consumes large amounts of energy, the
cultivation of plants consumes little, Lin went on, adding that the CO2
emissions produced by cultivating plants are only 3 percent of those produced by
animal products.</P>
      <P>"The CO2 emissions of the world's agriculture and livestock industries account
for nearly 20 percent of global CO2 emissions, " Lin said, adding that this
poses a very serious problem for the world.</P>
      <P>Lin suggested that each person could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 7 kg per
day if he or she adopts a vegetarian diet, and urged Chen to promote this kind
of diet.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen said he is aware that vegetarianism has become a world trend
in fighting global warming and admitted that it is a pity the EPA has failed to
promote it in its pamphlets promoting a "green lifestyle."</P>
      <P>He promised that the EPA will follow this route and that he will not eat meat on
Earth Day, which falls on April 22, and will encourage his colleagues to follow
suit.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Government officials were reluctant to confirm media reports
Thursday that Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Kuo will travel to Kaohsiung Friday
to discuss his investment plans with the local government, but voiced welcome
for possible investment by the major company.</P>
      <P>Chen Kai-ling, acting director of Kaohsiung's Department of Economic
Development, would only say that the Kaohsiung city government has contacted Hon
Hai Group, and expressed warm welcome and full willingness to cooperate for any
potential investment by the company.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu will be briefed on a software park on the eve of Kuo's
reported visit, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kaohsiung City Councilor Hung Ping-lang confirmed that Kuo will visit
the city Friday, where he will inspect the sites conserved  for  the
establishment  of  a software  park  and multifunctional trade and economic
park.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Group is reportedly planning to invest in the southern city's software
park and use the city's port as a key shipping point for its exports to other
countries.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports, authorities in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second-
largest city, are gearing up for possible investment by Hon Hai in the hope of
creating more job opportunities for local residents.</P>
      <P>Local media cited Kuo as saying that in response to a request by President-elect
Ma Ying-jeou, his group will launch investments in Kaohsiung City's software
park and will use the Kaohsiung Port, instead of Singapore or Hong Kong, to re-
ship export items produced by Hon Hai's plant in Vietnam to the United States or
European countries.</P>
      <P>Ma visited Kuo Monday to exchange views on Taiwan's industrial development at
Hon Hai's headquarters in Tucheng, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Media reports cited Kuo as saying that his group has begun assessing the
feasibility of several investment projects in Kaohsiung and concrete plans could
be made before Ma's inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>In the past, Hon Hai's investment in the domestic market mainly focused on
Taipei County and the Miaoli area, Kuo noted.</P>
      <P>It was reported that during the Monday meeting, Ma asked Kuo to increase
investment in Taiwan, particularly in southern regions, upgrade Hon Hai's
headquarters in Tucheng and turn it into the company's global business
operations center, and play a leadership role in advocating companies donate to
charity.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Ma and Vice President-elect Vincent Siew also met with Formosa
Petrochemical Group (FPG) Chairman Y. C. Wang at the group's headquarters in
Taipei City. Also present at the meeting were Kuo, Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp. Chairman Morris Chang and Chinese National Federation of
Industries Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Kuo, Wang and Chang are leading moguls from Taiwan's high-tech and traditional
businesses. Combined assets of their groups total more than NT$6 trillion
(US$196.72  billion)  in market value, accounting for over 20 percent of the
Taiwan's stock market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Minister of Finance Yen Ching-chang said Thursday that he was both
"surprised" and "regretful" that prosecution  authorities  have indicated  him
for violating  a "revolving-door" ban.</P>
      <P>Yen made the remarks after learning that the Taipei Prosecutors Office had
indicted him for violating a code of ethics by assuming the chairmanship of
Fuhwa Financial Holding Co. less than three months after retiring from public
office.</P>
      <P>"The prosecution has distorted the spirit of the revolving door ban, " Yen
claimed.</P>
      <P>He noted that he served as finance minister between Oct. 5, 2000 and Jan. 31,
2002 and that at the time of his leaving the post, Fuhwa Financial Holding was
not even established.</P>
      <P>Yen then served as Taiwan's representative to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
from Feb. 1, 2002 until March 23, 2005, but said the job had nothing to do with
financial holdings or financial supervision operations.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yen said that opposition Legislator Sun Ta-chien asked the Ministry of
Civil Service (MCS) in 2005 to explain his situation and the MCS replied that
his serving as chairman of a financial holding did not contravene the revolving-
door ban.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service Act states that former civil servants are banned from taking
top positions in any company they supervised during a five-year period before
their retirement from the service.</P>
      <P>Violators of the law can be subject to a maximum sentence of two years in jail
plus a fine of up to NT$1 million, and could also have their earnings from such
positions confiscated, according to the law.</P>
      <P>The banned positions  listed  under the law are chairman, supervisor, manager,
major shareholder and consultant.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said that Fuhwa Financial Holding Co. was approved by the
Ministry of Finance Dec. 31, 2001, when Yeh was still finance minister, although
the company was not established until Feb. 4, 2002.</P>
      <P>Yen assumed the chairmanship of Fuhwa Financial Holding in June 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hakka Tung Blossom Festival to kick off April 12</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hakka Tung Blossom Festival will be celebrated April 12-May 18 with over 100
artistic and cultural activities in northern, central and southern Taiwan,
organizers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs, which sponsors the annual flower
season, now in its seventh year, will work with eight county governments and 44
social groups to organize the activities, Council Chairman Lee Yung-teh said.</P>
      <P>The public can see spectacular drifts of the snow-white flowers in the counties
of Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, Taichung, Changhua, Yunlin and Nantou.</P>
      <P>To make the festival more eco-friendly, Lee said the council has also asked the
county governments to launch hiking, biking and jogging events, and he urged
visitors to use public transport.</P>
      <P>In addition, stores in these counties have designed 400 tung flower-related
products, including porcelain works and accessories, as part of the council's
efforts to promote the development of industries featuring Hakka culture, Lee
told a news conference heralding the opening of the festival.</P>
      <P>The products will be sold at 92 outlets and 78 designated restaurants will lay
on Hakka dishes, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>The council will also collaborate with local companies to launch a photography
exhibition highlighting the past 100 years of Hakka culture in Taiwan, as well
as organizing package tours, he went on.</P>
      <P>It will also offer 100,000 free copies of tour brochures after April 16,
providing information about the events.</P>
      <P>Lee added that for this first time this year, the council has followed Japan's
suit by working with local TV stations to give up-to-date  information  in their
weather forecasts  about the blossoming of the tung flowers from April 11-May
10.</P>
      <P>The  council  has  also  set  up a Web  site  at  http: //tung.hakka.gov.tw to
provide details about the festival and maps.</P>
      <P>April and May are the months when tung flowers, also known as paulownia flowers,
are in full bloom in central and northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The white flowers have become a symbol of the Hakka people and the flowering
season is celebrated in Hakka villages every year with traditional music and
song, coupled with the consumption of Hakka delicacies.</P>
      <P>The Tung Blossom Festival has been designated by the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications as one of the eight major events
of Tour Taiwan 2008-2009.</P>
      <P>The Hakka are a unique ethnic group of Han Chinese, who originally lived in
central China but gradually migrated south during different dynasties and
settled in Jiangxi, Fujian and Guangdong provinces, as well as in Taiwan, after
fleeing from war and famine.</P>
      <P>They were called Hakka, which literally means "guest families" in Chinese, by
the locals when they first settled in.</P>
      <P>The Hakka people are considered to be careful about maintaining their  cultural
traditions  and  one  of  their  outstanding characteristics is that they are
willing to venture into other parts of the world to establish themselves.</P>
      <P>The Hakka have migrated to Southeast Asia, East Africa, Europe and North and
South America in the past century.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has some 4.5 million Hakka people, accounting for 13.2 percent of the
population. The first wave of Hakka migrants came from China to Taiwan in the
1690s, when China was under the rule of the Qing Dynasty.</P>

      <P>The European Satellite Navigation Competition (ESNC) , held to promote
applications related to the Galileo  satellite  navigation  system,  will
include Taiwanese participants for the first time, the regional organizer
announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Galileo, based on concepts similar to that of the U.S. Global Positioning
System, is being built by the European Union and the European Space Agency. The
system is expected to be fully operational by 2013.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the commencement of Galileo, two German organizations
launched the ESNC in 2004 to encourage satellite navigation application services
using the Galileo system, including initially only Germany, France and Sweden.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years, the ESNC has expanded to include 11 regions, with 900
participants vying for the grand title of Galileo Master.</P>
      <P>For the 2008 competition, the organizers have decided to extend coverage to
Taiwan, and have chosen the Hsinchu-based Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) as a regional organizer.</P>
      <P>During a press conference, ITRI President Johnsee Lee said that in addition to
the Galileo Master prize, the ITRI has also established two special awards for
Taiwanese participants -- the ITRI Special Topic Prize and the Taiwan Region
Prize.</P>
      <P>According to the ITRI, the winner of the Galileo Master title will be rewarded
with 20,000 euros and free project incubation services for six months.</P>
      <P>The winner of the ITRI Special Topic Prize will receive 20,000 euros and free
ITRI incubation services for one year, while the winner of the Taiwan Region
Prize will get 10,000 euros, one round-trip air ticket to Europe and free ITRI

      <P>An academic team from Taiwan has deployed a temporary seismological network in
northern Vietnam to monitor earthquakes in the South China Sea area, the
National Science Council under the Cabinet learned Thursday.</P>
      <P>Members of the council were briefed about the research work of the team by Huang
Bor-shouh, a research fellow at the Institute of Earth Sciences of Academia
Sinica -- Taiwan's leading research institute -- and Chen Yue-gau, a professor
with the Department of Geosciences of National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>Huang and Chen said the network can send instant first-hand information about
seismic activity in the South China Sea back to Taiwan through either the
Internet or satellite.</P>
      <P>They said the team will expand the seismic network to cover southern Vietnam
during a trip later this year,  followed by cooperation with the Philippines to
set up a seismic network in that country.</P>
      <P>According to the two academics, the team chose Vietnam to deploy the network
because Vietnam has high seismic  action and the information received about
earthquakes in the South China Sea can be used to keep countries in the area
informed about the threat of tsunami, which are often caused by undersea quakes.</P>

      <P>The Philippine government will provide Taiwanese investors with incentives, such
as lower taxes and special visas, to attract them to its special economic zones,
a visiting Philippine delegation of government officials and businessmen, said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The delegation, named the RP Investment Mission to Taiwan, made the appeal at a
press conference aimed at promoting investment in the Philippines through
cooperation between the government and private sectors.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is a competitive  market with advanced technology and hard-
working people, Lilia Lima, director-general of the Philippine Economic Zone
Authority (PEZA) , expressed hope that more Taiwanese businesses will invest in
her nation's 134 economic zones.</P>
      <P>"Through  the investment,  Taiwan and the Philippines  can strengthen bilateral
cooperation, which also helps boost the economic development of both sides,"
said Lima.</P>
      <P>She further said that the Philippine government is willing to set up other
economic zones -- areas especially developed for foreign investors to set up
companies or factories -- to accommodate Taiwanese businesses' specific needs.</P>
      <P>Saying that the Philippines has a good investment environment with sound public
security, Lima said the PEZA, an investment promotion agency attached to the
Department of Trade and Industry, will provide the incentives to Taiwanese
investors.</P>
      <P>According to Lima, developers and operators in economic zones pay only a 5
percent Gross Income Tax in lieu of all other national and local taxes.</P>
      <P>"The government will also issue special visas for foreign investors and their

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's offer to give Taiwan two pandas would be better achieved based on a
city-to-city framework, Taipei City Education Department Director Wu Ching-ji
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As Taipei City and Chengdu City in China's Sichuan Province also maintain sports
exchanges, it would be more appropriate for China to give the two pandas under a
city-to-city framework to better safeguard Taiwan's national dignity, Wu said
while fielding questions during an interpellation session at the Taipei City
Council.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question from Councilor Lee Shiou-yen as to how much animal
conservation fees Taiwan should pay China if it takes the pandas, Wu said the
two sides should hold talks in a way acceptable to both to settle the issue.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, China charges the United States as much as US$1 million per
year in animal conservation fees for pandas that it has received from China, but
asks Hong Kong to pay a minimum sum for the same purpose.</P>
      <P>If China applies the Hong Kong model to Taiwan, it would undermine Taiwan's
independent sovereignty, but if China charges Taiwan the same fee as the United
States, it would be too expensive, Lee pointed out, adding that pre-entry
quarantine and breeding are other major concerns.</P>
      <P>The panda issue again sparked public attention after Ma Ying-jeou of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) won the March 22 presidential election, fanning hope
that the pandas could come to Taiwan after he assumes office May 20.</P>
      <P>Taipei City and Hsinchu City in northern Taiwan and Taichung City in central
Taiwan are competing to take charge of the rare animals.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party administration rejected the offer of the pandas
when Beijing first made the offer in May 2005 following a visit to China by KMT
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Some DPP government officials described the panda offer as a "Trojan Horse"
designed to dampen Taiwan's sovereignty. Beijing has named the animals "Yuan-
Yuan" and "Tuan-Tuan, " which together mean "unite" in Chinese.</P>

      <P>A total of 1.45 million pledges made by Taiwanese people in an international
competition for environmental protection brought a US$350,000 prize to Taiwan,
according to a press statement released Thursday by Standard Chartered Bank
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The statement said the prize will be used to support vital environmental
protection projects in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The competition, organized by the Standard Chartered Group and the World
Wildlife Fund, ran from last October to March 17 this year, attracting more than
3.4 million participants.</P>
      <P>The competition, titled The Greatest Race on Earth 2007/08, required
participants to choose up to eight personal energy-saving actions listed on an
activity Web site that they then pledged to stick to in their daily lives.</P>
      <P>The three countries or areas with the highest percentages calculated on the
basis of dividing the pledge number with the national population shared a US$1
million prize. Brunei ranked before Taiwan and won US$500,000, while Hong Kong
took third place and won US$150,000, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The eight pledges included not leaving tap water running while cleaning teeth,
turning lights out when leaving the room, spending a minute less in the shower
each day and reusing or refusing plastic bags at least three times a week.</P>
      <P>The statement pointed out that 14,600 liters of water can be saved every year
simply by making sure the faucet is fully closed every day, while another 2,920
liters can be saved if one spends a minute less in the shower each day and
turning off lights when leaving the room can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by
68 kg every year.</P>
      <P>Complete realization  of the 1.45 million pledges made by Taiwanese people will
reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 48,000 tons, prevent 28.5 million plastic
bags from being dumped and save 3.2 billion tons of water, according to the

      <P>The Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital in Hualien has been highly successful
using deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery to treat Parkinson's disease, a
doctor at the hospital said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsin-yuan, director of the hospital's Parkinson's Disease Treatment and
Research Center, made the remarks while meeting a group of his patients on the
eve of World Parkinson's Disease Day. The patients have all benefited from the
new method over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the Tzu Chi hospital has treated 110 patients with
Parkinson's disease or other movement disorders with DBS surgery, with a 100
percent success rate and accounting for 44 percent of all DBS operations
performed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As a result, the hospital has now become a center in Asia for teaching the DBS
method, which offers the best hope for patients with Parkinson's disease whose
symptoms are not sufficiently controlled by medication, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>The treatment involves the use of electrodes that are implanted in the patient's
brain at the precise location where nerve signals generate the tremors. The
electrodes are then connected to a neurostimulator, which sends tiny electrical
impulses through a wire into the brain to block the abnormal activity that
causes the tremors.</P>

      <P>The government will approve a set of commemorative  postage  stamps  to mark
the  inauguration  of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou May 20, ending a
controversial dispute over how the stamps should be named, a Cabinet source said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan respects their decision, " the source said, referring to the
conclusion reached by Ma's office and the state-run Taiwan Post Co.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after the office agreed to accept the new design, which
will carry the imprint "the Republic of China (Taiwan), " as a solution proposed
by the postal company to solve the dispute of how the country's name should
appear.</P>
      <P>Earlier, the office had suggested postponing the launch of the stamps because
the original design was controversial as it was printed with only the name
Taiwan rather than the country's national title -- the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The office's move was considered  a move to question the legitimacy of a
government decision to change the postal company's name from Chunghwa Post Co.
to Taiwan Post Co. last year as part of its name change campaign supposed to
highlight Taiwanese identity.</P>
      <P>Soon after the name change last February, the company also replaced the Republic
of China on its stamps with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the legislature dominated by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), Ma's
party, did not pass an amendment to an act governing the establishment of the
postal company last year, leaving the company's legal name as Chunghwa Post Co.</P>
      <P>Prior to Thursday's announcement, the Cabinet had insisted that the name Taiwan
should appear on the stamps, but it decided to soften its stance because it does
want to "politicize" the launch of the new stamps, the source noted.</P>
      <P>This year will be the fourth time that the postal company has launched inaugural
stamps since 1996, when the company sold 4.2 million stamps to mark former
President Lee Teng-hui's inauguration.</P>
      <P>In 2000, the company also sold 3 million commemorative stamps for President Chen
Shui-bian when his party, the Democratic Progressive Party, first came to power,
ending 55 years of KMT rule.</P>
      <P>However, 1.5 million of the 3.5 million stamps launched in 2004 to mark the
start of Chen's second term remain unsold.</P>

      <P>A full 42.195-km marathon conforming to international standards will take place
in the northern county of Hsinchu Sunday, an organizer said Friday.</P>
      <P>The 2008 UMC International Marathon is sponsored by the United Microelectronics
Corp. with assistance from Hsinchu county and city, as the route will go through
both administrative areas, said UMC Chairman Jackson Hu.</P>
      <P>In addition  to the full marathon  with a time limit of five-and-a-half hours
for completion, the race also has divisions for a half-marathon, as well as for
10-km, 5.6-km and 1.6-km runs.</P>
      <P>Enrollment had ended as of Friday, with nearly 13,000 people signing up,
including 1,400 UMC personnel and their families, and 2,500 police officers --
500 of whom are females -- led by National Police Agency Director-General Hou
Yu-ih, said Hu.</P>
      <P>Hu said the UMC started holding annual runs in 2004, but this year's was
upgraded for the first time by adopting the international standards for full-
and half-marathons. The previous runs were only 10 km.</P>
      <P>Hu said UMC sponsors the runs to promote sports in Taiwan, and he expressed hope
that Taiwanese people will develop good daily exercise habits, like President-

      <P>At least 26 draft bills regarding the people's livelihoods and welfare are
expected to be reviewed in the space of a week, a spokesman for the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Kuo-liang, an acting KMT caucus whip, said that in the coming week,
various committees under the KMT-dominated legislature will review the draft
bills that have already passed their first readings in the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng called a meeting
April 8 to seek consensus among legislators from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the KMT on a decision that committee meetings,
instead of meetings of the whole legislature, will be held throughout the
following week to review draft bills so that the Legislative Yuan will have
"some bills" processed in the days to come.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, it was decided that April 11, 15 and 18 -- originally
reserved for whole-legislature meetings -- will be used for committee meetings
because there are no bills left over from the previous legislature, which ended
late last year, for review.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh,  the 26 bills will include a central government general
budget bill and several related bills, a bill on labor insurance, an amendment
on lowering taxes on rice wine and related products, as well as an amendment to
statutes regarding the welfare of youths and children.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New WHO strategy litmus test for China's sincerity: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
04/11/08  16:33:55
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's new strategy of seeking both membership  of and observer
status in the World Health Organization (WHO) can serve as a litmus test to
gauge China's sincerity in wishing to improve bilateral ties, an official of the
Presidential Office said Friday.</P>
      <P>"Our new strategy can not only show the world our resolve to secure
representation in the world health regulatory body but can also serve as a
litmus test for China's sincerity in seeking to foster a better relationship
across the Taiwan Strait, " said Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General
Lin Chia-lung.</P>
      <P>According to the new strategy, President Chen Shui-bian will write to WHO
Director-General Margaret Chan to express the country's intention to join the
organization as a full member under the name Taiwan or at least as an observer
in its decision-making body -- the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- also in the
name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will ask the country's
diplomatic allies who are also WHO members to present the application at this
year's WHA conference scheduled to take place in Geneva May 19-24.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been unsuccessfully trying to become an observer in the WHA under its
official title Republic of China since 1997. Last year, it applied for full WHO
membership as Taiwan for the first time, which failed again due to same reason
as before -- China's opposition on the grounds that Taiwan is part of its
territory.</P>
      <P>"This year around, we'll continue seeking full WHO membership while also
pursuing WHA observer status should the membership bid be doomed again," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>The new strategy was adopted at a national security meeting presided over by
Chen a day earlier. Those present at the meeting included Vice President Annette
Lu, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Foreign Minister James Huang.</P>
      <P>As the country's new government will take over the reins of power just a day
after the opening of the WHA conference, Lin said Chen has also asked President-
elect Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to express his opinion
about the issue.</P>
      <P>"Ma responded April 4 with a written statement addressed to Presidential Office
Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen, in which he said the country should refrain from
using the name Taiwan in the membership application, " Lin said, adding that Ma
did not propose another title under which to apply.</P>
      <P>Noting that the country's designation has never been a point at issue or a major
hindrance to Taiwan's quest for WHO representation, Lin said the real obstacle
lies in the trammels of Beijing's "one China" policy and its merciless
obstruction of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, all those present at the meeting agreed that we should
continue to use the name Taiwan in applying for WHO membership or WHA observer
status to uphold policy continuity and consistency," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The decision came after Ma said in a recent interview with CNA that his
government will seek WHO participation as an observer, rather than as a full
member. He also expressed his support for Taiwan seeking membership in
international organizations under the name Chinese Taipei, in line with his
cross-Taiwan Strait policy of "modus vivendi" based on "dignity, pragmatism and
flexibility."</P>
      <P>Upon learning of the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration's decision to stick to its guns and apply again for WHO
membership as Taiwan, Ma's spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said Ma had reminded the
caretaker government of the possible grim results this strategy might bring.</P>
      <P>"As the DPP is still the party in power, we have no say in the matter and can
just be prepared to suffer the consequences," Lo said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said the ministry
does not want to see the WHO issue spark discord or confrontation between the
outgoing and incoming governments.</P>
      <P>Early in March, Yeh said, China sent a letter to all WHO member countries
asking them to promise to shut Taiwan out of any forthcoming WHA activities.</P>
      <P>"Faced with enormous diplomatic woes, parties of different political persuasions
should bear in mind that our battlefield is in Geneva, not on the domestic
front, " Yeh said, adding that both the ruling and opposition camps should work
hand-in-hand in the pursuit of their shared goals of safeguarding the public's
health rights and preventing Taiwan from becoming the only gap in the global
epidemic control network.</P>

04/11/08  16:49:40

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus
urged Vice President-elect Vincent Siew Friday to defend Taiwan's interests
during the Boao Forum set to take place in China this weekend.</P>
      <P>Siew departed from Taipei earlier that day for China's Hainan Province, where he
will attend the April 11-13 2008 Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) in his capacity as
chairman of the private Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation.</P>
      <P>William Lai, the DPP caucus whip, said that Siew's name was not included on the
official BFA namelist of delegates. Hence, he is attending the international
forum as a "business leader," Lai added.</P>
      <P>Lai said he hopes that Siew's attendance at the forum is aimed at speaking for
the rights and interests of the Taiwanese people rather than seeking profits for
himself, his party or other individuals.</P>
      <P>"I hope Siew will stand tall and defend the Taiwan people's interests so as to
live up to the strong mandate that the voters gave him  and  President-elect  Ma
Ying-jeou  in the just-concluded presidential election," Lai added.</P>
      <P>Siew has attended the Boao Forum every year since 2003 in his capacity as
chairman of the cross-strait foundation and this year's attendance at the purely
non-political forum has nothing to do with his election victory.</P>
      <P>According to Kuan Pi-ling, a deputy DPP caucus whip, the DPP chose not to press
Siew too much on the issue "because the DPP is a party of virtue and kindness"
and because the DPP is willing to give Siew an opportunity to defend Taiwan at
an international event.</P>
      <P>Kuan expressed hope that Siew will play the role of a Republic of China vice
president-elect who will not jeopardize Taiwan's interests on the world stage.</P>
      <P>"As an ROC vice president-elect  with  legal  status  and obligations, Siew
should strive to disseminate messages that will benefit Taiwan at the Boao Forum
and not let the international community misunderstand the true relations between
Taiwan and China, " she continued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hung Chi-chang, chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation, said Siew's attendance at the forum arouses both "expectation and
worry."</P>
      <P>Hung said he attaches great expectations on Siew's ability to conduct
substantive  negotiations  with Chinese  officials  on cross-strait business and
trade issues on an equal footing, but added that he is also worried that chances
for the two sides to enter practical engagement will be lost should he fail to
deliver on these expectations.</P>
      <P>Lin Cho-shui, a former DPP legislator, said Siew, who will be sworn in as vice
president May 20, owes the country an explanation on whether  he is visiting
China with an invitation  issued to international VIPs or with a taibaozheng --
a travel document issued by the PRC government for people from Taiwan that
apparently downgrades Taiwan to a province of China.</P>
      <P>"If Siew uses a taibaozheng to enter China, can we respect him as a vice
president-elect any longer? " Lin asked, adding that "if Siew enters China with
an invitation,  he should  show it to the accompanying media and not prevaricate
on his status."</P>

      <P>The Buddhist Tzu Chi Hospital in Chiayi County's Dalin township said Friday that
with the approach of warmer weather, people who often eat out should take
precautions against acute hepatitis A infection.</P>
      <P>Chou An-liang, a doctor in the hospital's Gastroenterology and Hepatology
Department, said that the hepatitis A virus is most commonly transmitted by the
fecal-oral route via contaminated food or drinking water, and he urged people
who eat out to make sure to choose restaurants that are sanitary.</P>
      <P>Noting that early symptoms of hepatitis A infection can be mistaken for
influenza, Chou said that people who experience fatigue or loss of appetite
should immediately have a blood test to see if they have been infected, as the
disease can lead to liver damage and even death if not treated properly.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that according to the latest Department of Health tallies, 82 cases
of hepatitis A infection had been reported this year in Taiwan as of the end of
March, or nearly double the amount for the same period of the previous year.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that as the weather gets warmer, frozen snacks and desserts
tend to become more popular and he urged those who enjoy such treats to make
sure they purchase sanitary products, as the hepatitis A virus can survive in
temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>Chou also said that people with hepatitis B or C or cirrhosis of the liver
should get tested for the presence of hepatitis A antibodies.</P>
      <P>If hepatitis A antibodies are not present, these individuals should consider
being vaccinated against the disease, he added.</P>
      <P>Chou also advised people who traveling to Southeast Asia, China or other areas

rate of cervical cancer, however, declined significantly by 31 percent, the
report said.</P>
      <P>Chao Kun-yu, deputy director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Health Promotion,
attributed the increase in the number of men suffering from oral cancer and
esophagus cancer to the popularity of unhealthy habits such as betel-nut
chewing, smoking and drinking.</P>
      <P>Chao ascribed the sharp decrease in the number of women suffering from cervical
cancer to the rising number of women receiving screening for the disease.</P>
      <P>Chao noted that the likelihood of men surviving five years after being diagnosed
with cancer stands at only 40 percent -- lower than the 63 percent for women,
mainly because men suffering from lung cancer, liver cancer and esophagus cancer
enjoy a five-year survival rate of only 10-20 percent.</P>
      <P>The DOH report also revealed that the average age at the time of cancer
diagnosis was 65 among men and 59 among women during the 2004-2005 period.</P>
      <P>For men aged 25-44, the top five types of cancer recording the highest incidence
rates were oral cancer, liver cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, colorectal cancer,
and cancer of the trachea, bronchus and lungs.</P>
      <P>For women in the same age group, the top five most common types of cancer were
breast cancer, thyroid cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer and ovarian
cancer, according to the report.</P>

according to a Thursday report by EFE, Spain's leading news agency.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumer's Foundation warned Friday that most disposable chopsticks provided
by restaurants in Taiwan contain toxic bleaching agents that pose considerable
health risks.</P>
      <P>In a random survey of disposable chopsticks from 40 restaurants nationwide
collected between December 2007 and January 2008, the foundation found that 68
percent of the samples had traces of sulfur dioxide, with one pair having an
amount of the chemical that exceeded accepted norms, said foundation Chairman
Cheng Jen-hung.</P>
      <P>"Even though the chopsticks are not produced by the restaurants, they are still
responsible for consumers' safety," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The sulfur dioxide, a colorless chemical used in bleaching and preserving foods,
helps restrain microbes from proliferating and prevents the chopsticks from
becoming moldy and change color.</P>
      <P>According to local regulations, the sulfur dioxide found on chopsticks should be
below 500 parts per million (ppm).</P>
      <P>People who are sulfite-sensitive can develop asthma, breathing difficulties,
diarrhea and vomiting when eating with disposable chopsticks, Cheng said, and he
advised consumers to smell the chopsticks before using them.</P>
      <P>If they smell sour, he said, they may contain sulfur dioxide.</P>
      <P>In addition, consumers should break the chopsticks after eating with them "to
prevent some manufacturers from reusing them, " Cheng suggested.</P>
      <P>"But the best solution is to use your own pair of reusable chopsticks to protect
the environment and your health, " Cheng stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei Zoo management criticized for unfair treatment of animals</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 11 (CNA)
04/11/08  18:56:44
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City councilors criticized the city zoo management Friday for treating
animals with two different standards under its plan to house a pair of long-
expected star guests -- two pandas from China -- in a "luxurious mansion" while
keeping other animals in small, shabby cages.</P>
      <P>City Councilors Hsu Chia-ching and Wu Si-yiao of the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) claimed that an "M-shaped" society is forming in the Taipei City
Zoo, after the management spent more than NT$300 million (US$9.9 million) in
building a special exhibition hall to accommodate the Chinese giant pandas.</P>
      <P>The "M-shaped" society generally refers to the widening gap between the rich and
poor in Taiwan and the island's dwindling middle class as more people cannot
keep up with the rising cost of living, especially under stagnating wages.</P>
      <P>In the case of the zoo, however, the Shin Kong Group, which owns some 18
affiliated companies in Taiwan, donated NT$250 million for the exhibition hall.</P>
      <P>Construction of the hall began in 2003 and it is scheduled to be completed this
June.</P>
      <P>According to the city councilors, the facility occupies a plot of land that
measures more than 1,400 square meters, and each of the pandas, if they could
come to Taipei for a long stay, would occupy a room that measures some 689
square meters - as big as a "presidential suite" in a five-star hotel.</P>
      <P>In comparison, a Burmese python only lives in a 6.6 square-meter glass
exhibition box, while the Asian yellow pond turtle, a protected amphibian native
to Taiwan, is kept together with many other kinds of turtles in one glass tank,
Hsu said at a press conference which she and her colleague held at the City
Council.</P>
      <P>Hsu said she suspected the dormitory-like living environment was the cause of
death of 10 Asian yellow pond turtles in 2006. She said the turtles were
attacked or died from disease transmitted by other species living with them.</P>
      <P>Wu criticized the zoo for attaching much greater importance to boosting tourism
than to animal conservation and educational affairs.</P>
      <P>She also doubted new Taipei Zoo Director Yeh Chie-sheng is the right person for
the post which requires professional knowledge of animal caring and
conservation.</P>
      <P>Yeh assumed the office April 2 after his predecessor Wu Pao-chung retired. He
was promoted from the position of deputy director general of the city Bureau of
Civil Affairs.</P>
      <P>In response to the criticisms, Yeh said he takes the job with an open mind, and
noted that the zoo, under the management of a group of professionals, has been
listed as one of the world's top 10 zoos.</P>
      <P>Chang Ming-chie, head of the animal division, said the zoo is not only
commissioned to display animals but also to shelter those seized in agriculture
authorities' raids against illegal animal smuggling.</P>
      <P>He also explained that in the wild, different species live together in one
place, and that if the species share similar genes they would mate with each
other to produce hybrids.</P>
      <P>Beijing  offered  the pandas to Taiwan  in 2005 following then-opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's visit to China in May that year, but the
pandas were then rejected by the current DPP government. The government and the
DPP criticized the offer as a publicity ploy by China, which wants to eventually
reunify with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The panda  issue returned  to the media  spotlight  after President-elect Ma
Ying-jeou of the KMT said he welcomed them after Ma won the presidential
election last month.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Zoo has been actively seeking to host the celebrities, which the city
government regards as a way to boost tourism.</P>

      <P>THSRC officials said that as of Thursday, the company has sold 22,873,331 high

    <TEXT>
      <P>Speakers at a Taiwan Thinktank forum on Friday branded Vice President-elect
Vincent Siew's appearance at an economic forum in China "irresponsible and
impetuous conduct" and suggested that the entry permit he used for the trip
belittled Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Siew's visit to the forum is completely impetuous and lacks a plan,  " said Lai
Yi-chung, deputy-director of the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
Department of International Affairs, at a seminar organized by the pro-DPP think
tank discussing expectations for Siew's trip.</P>
      <P>Siew left for China early Friday to take part in the Boao Forum for Asia being
held in China's southern Hainan province from April 11 to 13.</P>
      <P>He will be making his sixth consecutive appearance at the annual conference in
his capacity as chairman of the private Taipei-based Cross-Straits Common Market
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Siew's trip marks the first time a Taiwanese vice president-elect has set foot
on Chinese soil and will be the first public encounter between Chinese officials
and a member of the future Kuomintang administration since the party's Ma Ying-
jeou was elected president on March 22.</P>
      <P>The seminar's participants blasted Siew for the possibility that he might hold a
closed-door meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Lai said Siew should not talk to Chinese leaders as no consensus has been
reached yet in Taiwan on cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Ma, who won the presidency by a 17 percentage point margin, campaigned on the
promise of forging closer and more open economic ties with China.</P>
      <P>Many have attached significance to Siew's trip as a possible new beginning for
more harmonious cross-Taiwan Strait relations, although it was unclear how much
contact Siew would have with Chinese officials at the forum.</P>
      <P>Lai said, however, that it would be a severe test of the potential future use of
"the 1992 consensus" -- which has both Taiwan and China recognizing there is
only one China but agreeing to differ on its definition.</P>
      <P>If Siew is using a standard "re-entry  permit for Taiwan compatriots," it would
be a serious issue, Lai contended.</P>
      <P>The requirement of such a permit might be an indication that China refuses to
accept President- elect Ma Ying-jeou's "mutual non-denial (of each other's
existence) " stance, or even worse, that Ma's "1992 consensus"  would be
interpreted  as accepting the "one-China" policy," Lai argued.</P>
      <P>Former DPP legislator Lin Cho-shui said Siew should immediately make clear how
he entered China.</P>
      <P>"How could Siew brag that this is a 'diplomatic breakthrough' if he uses a
Taiwan compatriot entry permit? It would be a head of state (Hu Jintao) meeting
with a citizen of the People's Republic of China," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin questioned how Siew would lead his subordinates after being inaugurated on
May 20, arguing that officials of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation  or those
attending  Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forums, have not needed
Taiwan compatriot permits when visiting China in the past.</P>
      <P>A "tacit" face-saving agreement has existed in the past to facilitate the entry
of Taiwanese officials into China.</P>
      <P>At APEC forums, for example, the officials would present their invitation to
enter the country, and the Chinese government would unilaterly process their
"re-entry permit for Taiwan compatriots" without actually giving it to them.</P>
      <P>Lin urged Siew, if he used the permit to go to Boao, to relinquish it, apologize
and withdraw from the forum immediately.</P>
      <P>As to speculation that China intends to use this meeting between Hu and Siew to
divert attention in the international community on the Tibet issue, Lai said
"Taiwan should not become China's accomplice in suppressing Tibet."</P>

      <P>World Vision Taiwan and Starbucks Coffee Company Taiwan began their 10th year of
cooperation on charitable projects by launching Friday another campaign to help
indigenous children stay in school and attend after-school tutorial programs.</P>
      <P>"Contributing to society and the environment is an important mission of our
company, " said Hsu Kwang-yu, general manager of Starbucks in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The campaign, called "Bringing Hope to Indigenous Children" will kick off April
17 and last for three months.</P>
      <P>All 215 Starbucks coffee shops in Taiwan will have fundraising boxes and will
sell products like notebooks and reusable chopsticks to raise money to sponsor
961 indigenous children in central Taiwan's Nantou County, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan National Director Hank Du said that the two organizations
hoped to raise greater public awareness of the predicament of indigenous
children.</P>
      <P>Being one of the first group of children who benefited from the program, a boy
who went by the alias Hsiao Chun said he used to blame God for his misfortune
until he received support from the charity.</P>
      <P>"I learned to look at poverty and illness with a positive attitude, " said Chun,
suffering from polio. "I wish to help other underprivileged  indigenous
children  after  graduating  from university."</P>
      <P>Well-known Taiwanese designer Jamei Chen is also taking part in the event,
designing a limited edition T-shirt.</P>
      <P>"The black bear print on the T-shirt represents the forests where many
indigenous people live," she said.</P>
      <P>Starbucks launched the aid program with World Vision in 1999, the same year the
global company set up its first branch in Taiwan, to help those who lost their
homes in the September 21 earthquake that claimed over 2,000 lives, injured more

      <P>Some NT$ 31 million (US$ 1 million) has been raised in the past 10 years to

    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Trade Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
has reached consensus that it is still necessary for Taiwan to levy anti-dumping
duties on coated art paper imported from Japan to protect domestic products from
unfair competition.</P>
      <P>The commission announced its findings Thursday after conducting a review on
behalf of the Ministry of Finance in accordance with a ruling by the Supreme
Administrative Court in June 2008 that called for a re-evaluation of the impact
of imported coated art paper from Japan on local manufacturers of the same type
of product.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Administrative Court ruling was made after the finance  ministry
appealed  a decision  by the  Taipei  High Administrative Court in favor of an
importer of paper products, requiring the ministry to cease levying anti-dumping
duties on imported coated art paper from Japan.</P>
      <P>The MOEA commission said its members reached the conclusion that lifting the
anti-dumping duties would again cause harm to locally produced coated art paper
products, and that the commission will submit its observation for the finance
ministry to make its final decision.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has imposed anti-dumping duties on coated art paper imported from Japan
since July 2000 at rates varying between 8 percent and 44 percent.</P>
      <P>Because China has also imposed anti-dumping duties up to 71 percent on the same
product from Japan since August 2003, members of the commission said they fear
that lifting the anti-dumping duties now would turn Taiwan into a major dumping
ground for Japanese overproduction.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The anticipated establishment of direct transportation and trade links across
the Taiwan Strait will push Chinese companies to recruit professional talent in
Taiwan, an executive of a Taipei-based head hunting company said here Friday.</P>
      <P>Alex Huang, CEO in charge of the Chinese market for www.104.com. tw, one of the
largest Web sites providing human resource services in Taiwan, said opening
direct transportation routes will further boost cross-strait economic and
political exchanges and attract Chinese and foreign enterprises to set up
strongholds in Taiwan, creating more job opportunities for Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, his division in Shanghai has recently received many
inquiries for Taiwanese professionals from Chinese corporations.</P>
      <P>One of them, an electronics company, has offered to pay from 600,000-700,000
Chinese yuan (US$85,817) per year for a sales representative position in Taiwan,
he said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese company is offering the Taiwan-based post in the hope of receiving
more orders directly from Taiwan, he explained.</P>
      <P>Due to the lack of direct air travel and shipping services across the strait in
the past, Chinese businesses were passive about exploring means to bolster two-
way contacts, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Huang, however, said that with direct transportation and trade links hopefully
to be put in place between the two sides in the short term, Chinese companies
are set to take concrete measures to reduce transportation and other operating
costs.</P>
      <P>Against such a backdrop, more Chinese and foreign corporations will certainly
open offices or shops in Taiwan, creating a larger number of jobs in Taiwan and
boosting local people's willingness to work in China, he forecast.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by Huang's company after Taiwan's March 22
presidential election, more than 17,000 Taiwan job seekers were trying to land a
job in China in March -- the highest number for a single month in more than two
years.</P>
      <P>For the whole of last month, the number of full-time job seekers in the domestic
market had reached nearly 300,000, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang, who adopts a more pragmatic
approach to China, has repeatedly promised to implement direct air and shipping
services between Taiwan and China as soon as possible after his May 20
inauguration.</P>
      <P>Such links currently do not exist due to a political stalemate across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>

      <P>A group of elementary school students from northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County is
preparing to go on a trip to Singapore with money they earned in the past year
from selling home-made specialty foods.</P>
      <P>It's a dream come true for the group of 37 fifth-graders from Hsin Nan
Elementary School in Yilan's Chuangwei Township, who will depart from Yilan for
Singapore on April 15 for the five-day trip.</P>
      <P>At a function dubbed "Here we come, Singapore!" held at the school, County
Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua presented the banner representing the northeastern county,
wishing the children a happy and safe tour of Singapore.</P>
      <P>The fifth-graders have worked under the assistance and guidance of their parents
and teachers over the past year to produce and market home-made specialty foods,
such as Amerille melon marmalade, sweet preserved roselle, fermented soybean
curds and peanut candy, in a bid to earn enough money for their air tickets to
Singapore.</P>
      <P>The fifth-graders' primary activities in Singapore will be visits to Singapore's
Hong Wen Primary School, said Hsin Nan Elementary School Principal Liu Hsi-hsin.</P>
      <P>During the visits to the Singaporean elementary school, the students will show
off their talent and skills in riding unicycles, diabolo juggling and exercising
martial arts and gymnastics.</P>
      <P>Hsin Nan Elementary School has also prepared four brand new unicycles to give to
the Singaporean school as a token of friendship, Liu said.</P>
      <P>After the news of the fifth-graders' wishes to tour Singapore with their own
money was reported last month via foreign wire services, some Singaporean

      <P>The Taiwan branch of Hewlett-Packard (HP) Co., the world's largest personal
computer maker, has promised to help enhance the southern county of Kaohsiung's
development and education, a top county official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came a day after HP Taiwan obtained approval from the central
government to set up a facility in the southern county's 570-hectare science
park, said County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing.</P>
      <P>HP, which purchases NT$800 billion (US$26.3 billion) in goods from Taiwan last
year, has promised to help transform Kaohsiung into a WiMAX county that offers a
wide range of broadband wireless service, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The county government has been working hard to attract major high-tech companies
to the science park in recent years to narrow the development gap between
northern and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>HP Taiwan will encourage  its Taiwanese subcontractors  -- including Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co., the world's largest contract electronics maker, and
Quanta Computer Inc., the largest contract manufacturer of notebook computers --
to set up operations in the science park, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>HP Taiwan will also collaborate with local universities on various projects,
Yang said.</P>
      <P>In a separate project, the computer maker has promised to assist the county
government to build a village that gives visitors an opportunity to practice
English with native speakers who dress as people from different walks of life,
Yang noted.</P>
      <P>Some local governments in Taiwan have set up or planned to build such a village
to improve local schoolchildren's English ability.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will continue to ban more than 800 Chinese
agricultural products from entering Taiwan after May 20 when president-elect Ma
Ying-jeou will assume office, a COA official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Deputy COA Minister Hu Hu-hsiung noted that the COA currently imposes a ban on
more than 800 Chinese agricultural products, which he said is allowed under the
framework of the World Trade Organization based on the principles of protecting
a country's domestic agricultural products and quarantine necessity.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and China are WTO members.</P>
      <P>Hu also said that Taiwan currently allows the imports of more than 1,000 Chinese
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Hu was responding to questions by Legislator Twu Shiing-jer of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party who wanted to know how the COA will execute Ma's
cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>Ma advocated during his presidential campaign that Taiwan should export its
agricultural products to China to help Taiwanese farmers earn money but he
pledged to at the same time restrict Chinese agricultural products from flooding
into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait agricultural product exchanges, Hu said "the most urgent thing
is to help Taiwan farmers get intellectual property rights protection when their
products are exported to China."</P>
      <P>The move is aimed at "preventing agricultural know-how from flowing to China,"
he added.</P>

      <P>Freeway authorities warned motorists Friday they will face a steep fine if they
back up in the electronic toll collection (ETC) lane after discovering they
drove through the wrong toll booth.</P>
      <P>Motorists not equipped to use the ETC toll lane will be fined NT$3,000 to
NT$6,000 (US$99 to US$198) if they drive through the toll booth and then back
up, hoping to correct their mistake, or if they change lanes as they approach
the automatic toll booth, the Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau (TANFB) said
in a statement.</P>
      <P>Under the statute governing road traffic, drivers are fined NT$600 to NT$1,200
if they mistakenly drive through an ETC toll booth but then continue on their
way.</P>
      <P>One lane is usually reserved at toll stations on Taiwan's No. 1 and No. 3
freeways for cars equipped for the ETC system, which collects tolls
electronically.</P>
      <P>The system was embroiled in controversy when first installed, saddled with
disputes over its accuracy, the cost of the on-board unit, and suspicions that
Far Eastern Electronic Toll Collection bribed officials to win the contract to
operate the BOT (build, operate, transfer) project.</P>
      <P>But the freeway bureau announced Friday that it was now permitted Far Eastern to
open another ETC lane at the Taishan Toll Collection Station in Taipei County,
northern Taiwan, to ease heavy back-ups during peak hours.</P>
      <P>Traffic flow at the Taishan toll station is heavier than at other toll stations
on the freeway, with freeway bureau statistics showing that as many as 1,837
vehicles have poured through the station in an hour.</P>

    <HEADLINE>American artist exposes human wastefulness in exhibition in Taipei</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An environmental art exhibit featuring the enormity of waste produced in
contemporary America opened at Liberty Square in Taipei Friday to celebrate
Earth Day and to raise people's awareness about the environmental crisis.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, named "Running the Numbers -- An American self- portrait",
presents photographs by an American photographer, Chris Jordan, whose aim is to
visualize the enormity of the waste that people produce everyday.</P>
      <P>For example, people can see in his photos 106,000 cans that are dumped by
Americans in 30 seconds, two million plastic bags used by them every five
minutes, or 410,000 paper cups used in 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>Some images are synthesized by the photographer. People will see a picture of
woman's breast, made up of 32,000 Barbie dolls, which is also the number of
elective breast augmentation surgeries performed monthly in the U.S. in 2006.</P>
      <P>Visitors will also see a skull, with a cigarette between the teeth. The skull is
composed of 200,000 packs of cigarettes, equal to the number of Americans who
die from cigarette smoking every six months.</P>
      <P>"Through my work, I'd like to convey a message that collectivity is made of many
individuals, " said Jordan in the opening ceremony of the exibition, adding that
each individual is responsible for wastefulness, which is causing an
environmental crisis.</P>
      <P>Asked about the origin of his idea, the photographer, whose work has been
exhibited worldwide, explained that most people reading the huge numbers of the
waste on pages of newspapers or reports do not feel anything, and he wanted to
"translate the cold language to a visual one."</P>
      <P>Stressing the importance of every individual's effort, he urged people to reduce
daily waste, saying that "one thing we can control is our behavior."</P>
      <P>Jordan was once a lawyer, enjoying high social status and material wealth, but
he decided to dedicate himself to showing his care for the world through his
photos several years ago.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is organized by the National Geographic Channels International to
celebrate Earth Day on April 22. This year is the 10th anniversary of the
channel's presence in Taiwan and the 120th anniversary of the National
Geographic Society.</P>
      <P>The images are exhibited outdoor at Liberty Square from April 11-27.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew arrived in southern China's Hainan province
Friday to attend the 2008 Boao Forum for Asia, a visit that could represent a
watershed in cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>Although Siew is attending the economic conference in a private capacity, he
hoped that his attendance at the forum will help thaw relations between Taiwan-
China, which have been stalled for more than a decade because of a political
impasse over Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao and other Chinese officials will be present at the
annually held conference from April 11-13 and are expected to meet with Siew.</P>
      <P>"With this trip, I hope I can help the two sides build mutual trust and enhance
bilateral understanding  through the forum's platform," Siew said upon his
arrival.</P>
      <P>There had been speculation that Siew would meet Hu in a one-on-one meeting at
the forum, but a Siew spokesman said on Friday that Hu would instead meet with
Siew together with other members of Taiwan's 14-member delegation for 20 minutes
Saturday afternoon.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, Siew has not brought any message from President-
elect Ma Ying-jeou for Hu.</P>
      <P>Ma and Siew of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) won Taiwan's March 22
presidential election. The pair has vowed to set up closer economic ties with
China</P>
      <P>Siew's  delegation  will host a round-table  forum on the cross-strait economic
outlook on Saturday at the conference.</P>
      <P>"I would like to take the opportunity to exchange opinions on Asian and
international economic development and also share Taiwan's standpoint with the
rest of the world, " the vice president-elect said.</P>
      <P>Siew is the first vice president-elect from Taiwan to set foot on Chinese soil,
although he has repeatedly stressed that he is taking part in this year's Boao
Forum in his capacity as chairman of the Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation
as he has done over the past five years.</P>
      <P>The Boao Forum is a private organization dedicated to economic cooperation in
the region, with members including China, Japan and the Philippines.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan County Council Speaker Wu Chien-bao was sent to prison to serve a five-
month sentence Thursday on an illegal gambling conviction after a prosecutor
exercised her right of discretion and refused to allow him to pay a fine
instead.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court's Tainan branch had sentenced Wu to five months in prison
for operating and illegal gambling parlor in 2004 but commuted the sentence to
an NT$137,000 fine.</P>
      <P>When Wu appeared at the Tainan Public Prosecutors Office to settle the case,
prosecutor Chang Wan-ning decided that the fine would not serve justice because
Wu's illegal gambling operation netted huge profits, with daily proceeds
amounting to millions of NT dollars.</P>
      <P>Citing one example, Chang said Wu's deputy, Kuo Hsiu-chu, admitted to losing
NT$80 million (US$2.64 million) within 10 days at Wu's underground casino during
the 2004 Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor decided on the spot to have Wu serve his five-month sentence
without delay, based on Article 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the
Republic of China, which gives prosecutors the power to enforce a prison
sentence if they deem a fine instead as an insufficient remedy.</P>
      <P>Wu appeared stunned, as he was obviously unprepared for the prosecutor's
decision. His family said they will ask lawyers to file a petition within one
month to seek redress for his imprisonment.</P>
      <P>If unsuccessful, Wu, as an inmate serving a criminal sentence, could be deprived
of his qualification as an elected Tainan County councilor.</P>
      <P>The 57-year-old  Tainan County Council speaker has been a controversial figure.
A member of the opposition Kuomintang, he was elected as a county councilor in
1998 and was re-elected in 2002 and became the speaker in the same year.</P>
      <P>Wu failed in his bid for a seat in the legislature when Li Chun-yi, his opponent
from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, defeated him in the Jan. 12
legislative election by a margin of 8,000 votes.</P>
      <P>He was connected to a game-fixing ring in Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball
League last year. The case is still pending in the Tainan District Court.</P>
      <P>According to prosecutors, he paid five Chinatrust Whales players NT$300,000 each
through the head of a gambling ring in exchange for their cooperation in fixing
the games. The team is one of six professional baseball teams in Taiwan,</P>
      <P>The gambling ring leader also helped Wu to profit by using dummy accounts to
place large bets at six gambling outlets. The prosecutors said that at one of
the outlets, the weekly turnover amounted to a staggering NT$1.4 billion
(US$46.2 million).</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP chairman would probably attend presidential inauguration</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Frank Hsieh said Thursday that he
"would probably attend" the May 20 inaugural ceremony of President-elect Ma
Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>In an interview with cable television network SET TV, the defeated former
presidential candidate said that he was considering attending the ceremony,
adding that he was also present at the inauguration of former president Lee
Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh dismissed speculation that the DPP was mired in infighting
ahead of the party's election of a new chairman to replace him in May. Hsieh has
decided to step down.</P>
      <P>Media reports of infighting grew after Hsieh recently accused President Chen
Shui-bian of applying double standards in the handling of corruption charges.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Hsieh criticized Chen for demanding that DPP members
who were merely suspected of corruption be expelled from the party, but for
being lenient when it came to Chen's family.</P>
      <P>Chen's wife has been indicted for embezzlement and his son-in-law has been
convicted of insider trading.</P>
      <P>"It is incorrect to call our self-examination a power struggle, " Hsieh said,
adding that his remarks about Chen were made in connection with self-reflection
by the party.</P>
      <P>Hsieh stressed that "there isn't any need for infighting, " even though the DPP
lost the presidential election. He said he will never run for president or party
chairman again.</P>
      <P>To win the city and county chief elections in late 2009, Hsieh said the DPP must
first engage in reflection and reform, while cementing party unity.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairman also encouraged those interested in running for the DPP
chairmanship to throw their hats in the ring. He expressed hope that the next
chairman will be a reformer and will be able to reach out to the grassroots
communities.</P>
      <P>With regard to his turning down a visit request by Ma, Hsieh explained that
considering that Ma was quite busy and the meeting served as a mere formality,
he decided not to meet with Ma and that it was not a "boycott".</P>
      <P>He added he will continue to keep a close eye on the government after Ma takes
office May 20.</P>
      <P>On his plans after stepping down as party chairman, Hsieh said he hopes to share
his experience in political and public affairs with the general public,
particularly young people, to enable them to develop the capabilities of
supervising the government.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also floated an idea of running a "shadow government" to monitor the
government, which would be based on the DPP's basic values and concept of a
"wellbeing economy."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he plans to modify his campaign Web site into an "Internet Radio" to
allow experienced politicians and young talents to work together to upgrade
grassroots people's ability to supervise government operations.</P>

      <P>A total of 1.18 million for-profit businesses were operating in Taiwan at the
end of 2007, down 0.2 percent from a year earlier, according to a report by the
country's statistics bureau profiling Taiwan's economic activity.</P>
      <P>As of the end of February 2008, there were 596,000 "existing companies"
officially registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, down 3.6 percent
from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>But to get a more accurate look at overall economic activity in Taiwan, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS) relied on tax
bureau figures to assess the number of businesses and in the country and the
size of their turnover.</P>
      <P>Sole proprietorships, like small retail stores, and partnerships are not
included among the MOEA's registered companies but do file taxes and account for
a substantial amount of economic activity.</P>
      <P>Over half, or 612,052, of the businesses in the DGBAS report were involved in
the wholesale and retail sectors, down 0.7 percent from the end of 2006, while
the cultural, sports and leisure category had the fewest number of companies at
25,546, down 9.3 percent from the end of 2006, the report, released Thursday,
indicated.</P>
      <P>Despite the growing demand for leisure activities in Taiwan, the decline
registered in the leisure sector was the largest of any sector, followed by the
1.3 percent decline in the number of manufacturers to 128,761, the statistics
showed.</P>
      <P>Some sectors showed increases in the number of companies, with the
accommodations and food-services sector growing 3 percent with 97,758 businesses
and the real estate and rental sector growing 2.5 percent with 26,552
businesses.</P>
      <P>The total sales of the businesses in the DGBAS study rose 4.2 percent year on
year to NT$36.32 trillion (US$1.19 trillion), with sales by manufacturers
growing 10.4 percent in 2007 to NT$13.29 trillion, the highest of any business
category. Sales in the wholesale and retail sector totaled NT$12.5 trillion for

      <P>The Tainan city government reported Friday that 44 suspected enterovirus cases
were discovered in the city between mid-March and April 10, with the case load
likely to grow as the peak period for the virus quickly approaches.</P>
      <P>Four of the suspected cases were serious ones, the southern Taiwan city said in
a statement.</P>
      <P>A 20-month-old boy in the southern county of Kaohsiung died from the enterovirus
on March 5, the first reported fatality in Taiwan this year caused by the virus
that is highly infectious in young children.</P>
      <P>Of the enterovirus cases that have hit children in Taiwan so far this year, 85
percent of the infected children were under the age of five and 73 percent were
under the age of three, the city's health bureau said, citing figures released
by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health as of
April 3.</P>
      <P>The epidemic usually emerges in late March before reaching its peak between May
and June. It often reappears in September when schools open.</P>
      <P>Outbreaks of the virus in Taiwan have been centered in the southern part of the
island, with Tainan City particularly hard hit in recent years.</P>
      <P>In its statement, the city's health bureau urged local parents not to ignore the
virus and stressed frequent hand-washing was still the most effective way to
avoid contracting enterovirus.</P>
      <P>The bureau said the practice was not as widespread as it needed to be, citing a
recent survey conducted among people who take care of children under five years
old.</P>
      <P>Only 20.2 percent of the respondents in the survey said they wash their hands
before coming in contact with children, which poses a serious health concern,
the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials have also discovered from their visits to local schools to
raise awareness of the epidemic that about 40 percent of the city's children did
not wash their hands cleanly enough.</P>
      <P>Those infected with the virus can develop blisters on their hands, feet or in
the mouth, or a flu-like illness with fever and muscle aches.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had not reported any deaths from enterovirus in the past two years.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan experienced a severe outbreak of E71 -- the deadliest type of
the virus -- with 405 children infected, 78 of whom died. Another E71 outbreak
in 2005 infected 145 children, 15 of whom died.</P>

      <P>Legislator Trong Chai of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) announced
Friday that he will register next Monday to run in the May 18 party chairman
election.</P>
      <P>The stalwart pro-Taiwan independence lawmaker was the first potential candidate
to make his intention to run for the post publicly known.</P>
      <P>Chai said his platform will include a reform of the party's nominating mechanism
as well as appointing members from the younger generation to serve as the
party's vice chairmen so that they will have the opportunity to groom themselves
for leadership.</P>
      <P>"In this way, the party can achieve generational change, " he said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Sing-nan, who is also a staunch advocate of Taiwan
independence, said that no individual who takes the helm of the party can reform
the party alone and that he would suggest to Chai that he set up a collective
leadership after being elected.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that 200,000 DPP members take part in community service as
volunteers, so that they will "touch the hearts of the public"  like members of
Buddhist  Compassion  Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, the largest charity
organization in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chai's announcement drew mixed reactions from colleagues within the party.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi said that he couldn't dismiss anyone who wants to
contribute to the party, but if only Tsai registers, then there will be no other
choice, which he said was bad for the DPP.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed the hope that "more will register with the party," and that "the
younger generation display passion."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Su Cheng-ching said he believes an election would further
splinter the party, already thrown into disarray after severe setbacks in the
March 22 and the Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that Council of Agriculture Minister Su Jia-chyuan would be a
suitable candidate.</P>
      <P>The legislator, who represents a district in the southern county of Pingtung
that Su Jia-chyuan once headed, noted that a party chairman "should have abroad
base of support."</P>
      <P>He noted that Su Jia-chyuan has served as a legislator, county magistrate and
interior minister, giving him ample experience in a variety of major posts.</P>
      <P>There are also reports that the now-defunct New Tide Faction within the party
could field former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen for the post.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, former Council for Hakka Affairs Chairman Luo Wen-jia said
Friday that he believes he is not up to the challenge of serving as party
chairman.</P>
      <P>"There are others who are more suitable to serve in the post, " Luo said.</P>
      <P>But the outspoken young Turk also said frankly that he believes the
"heavyweights" within the party are no longer suitable to take part in the race.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh recently suggested that members of the party's younger
generation, including Luo and former Government Information Office head Lin
Chia-lung, both in their 40s, run in the election.</P>
      <P>The DPP will invite hopefuls to register with the party April 14-18 and organize
a platform presentation for the candidates May 10. After the registration, the
party will try to reach a consensus on one candidate through coordination, and,
if that fails, then the party chairman election will be held May 18.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei prosecutors are seeking a life sentence for a former colleague whom they
indicted Thursday for taking bribes totaling NT$6.2 million (US$204,620) in 2002
and 2003 while investigating two criminal cases.</P>
      <P>If the Taipei District Court hands down a life sentence as requested, it will be
the harshest punishment for an offense by a prosecutor in Taiwan's judicial
history.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment submitted to the court Thursday, Ko Chin-chu, 60,
received NT$5.5 million in 2002 from Hong-En Hospital in Taipei through a lawyer
friend while he was investigating the hospital's involvement in health insurance
fraud.</P>
      <P>The hospital allegedly paid the bribe in return for his promise not to prosecute
its executives.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Ko again worked with his lawyer friend, Lu Ching-nan, to solicit
NT$700,000 from Chung Hua Hospital while investigating allegations  that
questioned  the legality  of the hospital's operations, in exchange for a
promise that none of the defendants would be indicted.</P>
      <P>This was not Ko's first brush with the law. In September last year, the Taipei
District Court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on corruption charges.</P>
      <P>The court found him guilty for taking a NT$1.2 million bribe in 2003 in return
for promising not to indict Huang Ju-yi during an investigation into the
gangster's alleged criminal activities. Ko has appealed the case.</P>

      <P>A human rights group on Friday urged Vice President-elect Vincent Siew to ask
China's president to stop suppressing Tibet and hold dialogue with the Tibetan
government- in-exile led by the Dalai Lama during their Saturday meeting at an
economic forum in China.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based group, Taiwan Friends of Tibet, issued the call in a press
release asking Siew to relay its concern over human rights conditions in Tibet
after riots against Chinese rule erupted in mid-March in Lhasa.</P>
      <P>Siew and other members of Taiwan's delegation are expected to meet with Chinese
President Hu Jintao Saturday afternoon for 20 minutes in a private meeting.</P>
      <P>The group appealed to Beijing to immediately halt all acts of suppression in
Tibet and begin peace talks quickly with the Dalai Lama.</P>
      <P>"Beijing would win the highest respect from Taiwan's people and others across
the world if it does so, " the group said in the statement.</P>
      <P>Despite its impressive economic development over the past two decades, China
will be still be seen as an authoritarian and feudal state if it continues to
adopt oppressive policies against its people, who are keen for progress,
modernization and human rights, the group said.</P>
      <P>China should seize its hosting of this weekend's Boao Forum for Asia to display
its leadership role and prove to the entire world its claim that its rise will
be peaceful, especially as it will also host the 2008 Olympic Games in August,
the group asseted.</P>
      <P>"Now is the best time for China to change its image and improve its
international status before the entire world," it argued.</P>
      <P>Siew departed earlier in the day for the 2008 Boao Forum for Asia annual
conference being held in Hainan province in southern China through April 13. The
forum's main goal is to step up economic and trade cooperation in Asia.</P>
      <P>Siew's participation at this year's conference has sparked widespread attention
from across Taiwan's political spectrum because of his status as president-
elect. The visit could be an early test of the newly elected government's hope
for closer ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Although Siew has stressed that he is attending the forum in his private
capacity as chairman of the Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation, he is the
first vice president-elect from Taiwan ever to set foot on Chinese soil.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lauded Taiwan's military Friday for remaining neutral
in all local and central elections since he first took office in 2000.</P>
      <P>The military neutrality demonstrated over the years is "a sign of progress",
Chen told troops based on Penghu Island, adding that no member of the military

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kazakhstan used a mystery player to pull even with Taiwan Friday in the first
day of their Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group I playoff tie being played in Almaty
this weekend.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan's top singles player, Lu Yen-hsun, dispatched Kazakh veteran Alexey
Kedryuk without much drama, 6-3, 7-5, 6-2, Chen Ti was called on to face world
no. 127 Yuriy Schukin, the center of attention at this weekend's event.</P>
      <P>On the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) Web site, Schukin is listed as
a Russian and local media reported that even Kazakh journalists were wondering
about his legitimacy as a member of the home Davis Cup team.</P>
      <P>But Schukin recently obtained a Kazakhstan passport, and because he had never
competed for Russia in the sport's premier international team event, he was
eligible to compete for the central Asian nation.</P>
      <P>The timing could not have been worse for Taiwan, which was likely to cruise to
victory if Kazakhstan did not have its Russian import.</P>
      <P>Instead Chen Ti, currently ranked 284th in the world, found out the hard way
that Schukin is a potential threat, losing in five sets after taking two of the
first three.</P>
      <P>Schukin's 3-6, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory gave his adopted country a 1-1 tie
after the first day's singles, putting the pressure on Taiwan in Saturday's
doubles, in which Chen and Lu are likely to team up, although Yang Tsung-hua,
the Australian Open Junior Doubles champion, could also get the nod.</P>
      <P>Taiwan lost its opening round match against Lleyton Hewitt-led Australia 4-1 in
February in Kaohsiung and is now trying to avoid what would be a painful
relegation.</P>
      <P>A victory over Kazakhstan this weekend would keep Taiwan in Group I and conclude
its Davis Cup campaign for the year.</P>
      <P>But a defeat would send it into another playoff against the loser of the
Uzbekistan-Philippines tie in September, with the loser being relegated to
Asia/Oceania Zone Group II, where Taiwan has not played since 2003.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP legislative caucus comes up with internal reform initiatives</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 11 (CNA)
04/12/08  00:32:04
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
Friday that a controversial public polling method should be scrapped and that
the party should step up efforts to recruit young members, following a meeting
Friday held to review the party's latest election setbacks.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus reached the consensus at the meeting aimed at
bringing the demoralized party back to its feet.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers present at the meeting suggested that polls that exclude "pro-
blue" voters should no longer be used in nominating party candidates for local
or national elections.</P>
      <P>In choosing candidates to represent the party in the Jan. 12 legislative
elections, the party held a primary and an opinion poll to decide the winner.</P>
      <P>The opinion polls attempted to weed out respondents who were likely to support
rival Kuomintang (KMT) candidates so that only the sentiment of hard-core DPP
supporters was gauged, which many believe resulted in nominees who were less
attractive to independent voters.</P>
      <P>The participants also agreed that the party should produce its nominees through
consultation rather than primaries because the latter have often led to
irreparable divides within the DPP.</P>
      <P>A consensus was also reached on the need to increase the number of the party's
central and local officials and young members serving as party standing
committee members to give them more opportunities to take part in the party's
operations.</P>
      <P>They also advised that the DPP plan early for the city and county chief
elections scheduled for late 2009.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lin Shu-fen, who said that the party has been criticized for
being estranged from the public during its eight years in power, suggested that
it should "listen to the views of the people."</P>
      <P>She also said the party needed to continue its tradition of debating different
paths for the country's future and "to enrich its discourse on the core values
of the party."</P>
      <P>The participants argued that the DPP, which was founded on the ideals of
cleanness and integrity, has seen its image tainted during the past eight years,
especially in the latter part of President Chen Shui-bian's second-term when a
series of scandals surrounding his family members and close aides came to light.</P>
      <P>"The party failed to review the problems in time," Lin said, and after the
impression of corruption took root, the party couldn't buck the trend and had
suffered three major election setbacks since 2005, including the 2005 city and
county chief elections and the Jan. 12 legislative elections this year.</P>
      <P>They also said that the reforms that the party promoted, such as reform of the
judicial, electoral and financial systems and a revamping of preferential saving
rates for retired civil servants, military personnel and public school teachers,
had failed to meet their goals.</P>
      <P>The DPP also failed to force the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to return its ill-
gotten assets to national coffers, they said.</P>
      <P>On the campaign strategy of the presidential election, they believed  that the
DPP's slogans of "Taiwan reformation"  and "happy economy" were too abstract for
Taiwan's voters.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP's warning against the KMT's "one-party dominance" of both the
legislative and executive arms of the nation, as well as challenges to KMT
candidate Ma Ying-jeou's loyalty and integrity over his alleged U.S. permanent
resident status, did have some effect, the tactics failed to keep the voters.</P>
      <P>The rude language leveled against Ma by some DPP members also turned the
election into a negative campaign, which they said ran counter to the party's
theme of "bringing happiness" to the public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Inflation to approach 3% if fuel, power rates rise: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
04/12/08  00:39:19
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's inflation rate will approach 3 percent if the new government
simultaneously raises gasoline and electricity prices, the country's top
economic planner cautioned Friday.</P>
      <P>"The domestic consumer price index (CPI) could register nearly 3 percent annual
growth this year if the new government to be sworn in May 20 opts to raise
electricity and fuel prices in one 'lump sum' move, " said Ho Mei-yueh,
chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with several local media outlets, Ho said the incumbent
Democratic Progressive Party administration has consistently followed several
principles in addressing fuel and utility pricing issues,  including operating
costs,  corporate finances, market mechanisms and rate segmentation depending on
the customer.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Ho said that in the wake of recent sharp spikes in international
commodity prices, the adjustment of domestic fuel and electricity prices could
no longer be set simply based on raw material cost.</P>
      <P>"Both the domestic and global macroeconomic situations should be factored in
while formulating fuel and utility pricing policy, " Ho argued, adding that
finding an opportune time and drafting complementary measures were extremely
important in deciding whether to adjust gasoline and electricity prices.</P>
      <P>State-run oil refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan has proposed raising its product prices
by NT$2.8 per liter from May and another state-run enterprise Taiwan Power Co.
also plans to raise electricity prices by NT$0.65 per kilowatt hour from May.</P>
      <P>Should the two price hike plans be adopted and the local currency's exchange
rate against the greenback stay at NT$30 to the dollar until the end of the
year, inflation would rise more than 1 percentage point to around 3 percent, Ho
warned.</P>
      <P>She also said economic growth would drop by at least 1 percent from last year's
level to about 3.3 percent.</P>
      <P>Noting that small- and medium-size enterprises tend to bear the brunt of rising
inflation, Ho said the incoming Kumointang government should take multiple
factors into account in addressing fuel and electricity pricing issues.</P>

      <P>Taipei prosecutors are seeking a life sentence for a former colleague whom they
indicted Thursday for taking bribes totaling NT$6.2 million (US$204,620) in 2002
and 2003 while investigating two criminal cases.</P>
      <P>If the Taipei District Court hands down a life sentence as requested, it will be
the harshest punishment for an offense by a prosecutor in Taiwan's judicial
history.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment submitted to the court Thursday, Ko Chin-chu, 60,
received NT$5.5 million in 2002 from Hong-En Hospital in Taipei through a lawyer
friend while he was investigating the hospital's involvement in health insurance
fraud.</P>
      <P>The hospital allegedly paid the bribe in return for his promise not to prosecute
its executives.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Ko again worked with his lawyer friend, Lu Ching-nan, to solicit
NT$700,000 from Chung Hua Hospital while investigating allegations  that
questioned  the legality  of the hospital's operations, in exchange for a
promise that none of the defendants would be indicted.</P>
      <P>This was not Ko's first brush with the law. In September last year, the Taipei
District Court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on corruption charges.</P>
      <P>The court found him guilty for taking a NT$1.2 million bribe in 2003 in return
for promising not to indict Huang Ju-yi during an investigation into the
gangster's alleged criminal activities. Ko has appealed the case.</P>

humiliated and have taken to venting their anger on the Internet.

    <HEADLINE>Cluster infection of German measles reported in central Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) reported Saturday  a  cluster  infection  of
German  measles  among Chinese-Malaysian students studying at a central Taiwan
university.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said
that seven students were confirmed to have contracted German measles.</P>
      <P>Chou said that the matter first came to light when two male Chinese-Malaysian
students at the university sought treatment at the same clinic April 3 and April
4, respectively, after developing the symptoms of coughing, running noses and
rashes.</P>
      <P>As the two students were from abroad and had similar symptoms, the doctors
treating them alerted the DOH April 6.</P>
      <P>Chou said that health officials were dispatched to the school to collect
specimens  for  testing.  Among  the  seven  male Chinese-Malaysians and one
female Taiwanese student who had had contact with the two infected men, five
were confirmed to have measles, including the Taiwanese student.</P>
      <P>Further investigation found that one of the infected students had returned to
Taiwan from Malaysia in late February, and developed obvious symptoms of the
disease March 13. The DOH thus suspected that the cluster infection had
originated overseas.</P>
      <P>Chou said that the DOH has vaccinated 59 other foreign students against measles,
mumps and rubella (MMR).</P>
      <P>He said that as the rate of MMR vaccination in Taiwan is as high as 95 percent,
and the vaccine is 95 percent effective, the DOH estimates that "the disease is
unlikely to spread further."</P>
      <P>Asked why the Taiwanese student was also infected, Chou said that she should
have had 95 percent protection with the MMR vaccine, but that less than five
percent of vaccinated people, because of individual factors, could still get the
disease.</P>

      <P>A pilot project aimed at delivering better health care to senior indigenous
people has proved fruitful after several months of work, volunteers said
Saturday at a press conference.</P>
      <P>The project, launched in late 2007, was introduced by the Department of Public
Health (DPH) of National Cheng Kung University and the National Association  for
the Promotion  of Community University (NAPCU) to establish a complete system of
public health care among indigenous tribes, most of which live in remote
mountain areas.</P>
      <P>Under the project, volunteers are focusing on providing health education to
elderly people, and on establishing a team of health workers in each clan, said
Chen Mei-xia, a DPH professor and volunteer on the project.</P>
      <P>"Indigenous people need a public health system that would take into
consideration factors such as their particular values, cultures, and autonomy, "
the professor said, referring to the basis of the pilot project.</P>
      <P>She said that "indigenous people are at a disadvantage in the area of public
health because they have long been neglected by the society, " adding that the
public health system in Taiwan is not very well developed.</P>
      <P>In general, indigenous people lack medical resources and life expectancy is
about an average of 10 years shorter compared to the wider population in Taiwan,
Chen added.</P>
      <P>In 2007 the average life expectancy in Taiwan was 77.5 years, according to the
Department of Health under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The DPH and NAPCU have recruited 188 volunteers, including 80 who are themselves
indigenous, to work among 15 clans of the many tribes nationwide, and those
numbers are expected to increase, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Young people have a chance to not only help care for the elderly, but also to
contribute to the continuity of the indigenous culture," said Li Hui-lan, a
religious worker in a clan in southern Taiwan who is also one of the volunteers
on the project.</P>
      <P>Li also said that the communication between the volunteers and senior members of
the tribes could serve the purpose of recording oral history.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the project will continue. Elderly people are very happy to know
that others care about them," said Zhou Jin-mei, who has served at a health
center in southern Taiwan for 23 years and is participating in the project.</P>
      <P>"Now we particularly need more funding for disease prevention, " she added.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the government officially recognizes 13 indigenous tribes that
represent 484,000 people, or about 2.1 percent of the total population of the
country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Youth Policy White Paper symposium held</HEADLINE>

      <P>The "2008 Symposium on the Results of the Youth Policy White Paper Guidelines"
was held Saturday,  with government leaders, scholars and youth representatives
discussing topics related to youth development, participation, health and
protection.</P>
      <P>The symposium, sponsored by the National Youth Commission, the Ministry of the
Interior,  the Ministry of Education and the Department of Health, was held at
the Civil Service Development Institute in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at the opening of the symposium,  Premier Chang Chun-hsiung expressed
the hope that the conclusions reached at the gathering will help the government
in formulating and implementing policies that are more in line with the needs of
the nation's youth.</P>
      <P>"By promoting such policies, it is hoped that an environment where all Taiwan's
young people have an equal opportunity to develop will be created, and the
competitiveness of the nation's youth will increase with each generation," he
said.</P>
      <P>A National Youth Commission official said at the symposium that as youth affairs
and policies cannot be handled by a single department, the commission in 2002
invited a group of scholars and representatives of various ministries and
agencies to establish the "Youth Affairs Advancement Committee."</P>
      <P>He added that the Youth Policy White Paper Guidelines were put forward in 2005
to provide a foundation for the government's general plan for youth affairs,  in
the areas of youth  development, participation, health and protection.</P>
      <P>The official further said that youth representatives have been invited to the
symposium to give them an opportunity to have their voices heard in order to
allow the government to gain a better understanding of the real needs of
Taiwan's young people.</P>
      <P>Among the many proposals made by youth representatives at the symposium was one
related to Internet crime put, forward by Wu Pei-chi, a student at Beitou Junior
High School in Changhua County, who took part in the discussion on youth
protection.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that although Internet crime involving youth, including online dating
scams and online fraud, has become more serious in Taiwan, the government has
yet to come up with adequate measures to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>She suggested that the government give greater priority to formulating policies
and laws to prevent online crime involving young people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liou Hsin-hsiang, a high school student in Hualien County who took
part in the discussion on youth health, complained about the lack of literature
and fine arts resources in eastern Taiwan and the fact that schools there do not
place much importance on the cultural development of students.</P>
      <P>She suggested that the government take measures to address these inadequacies in
order to create an environment where youth around the country may have the
opportunity to develop into well-rounded individuals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD warns against overreliance on Chinese tourists to boost economy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  12  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman Ho Mei-yue
warned Saturday against relying too heavily on Chinese tourists to boost the
economy, calling this a "passive" approach that could prove dangerous.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks ahead of a planned meeting between Chinese President Hu
Jintao and Taiwan's vice president-elect, Vincent Siew, Saturday afternoon on
the sidelines of the Boao Forum Asia being held in southern China's Hainan
province.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of speculation about whether Hu and Siew would discuss
cross-Taiwan Strait trade and economic issues, such as the proposed direct air
links and the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists, and whether the meeting
would lead to a thawing of relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Siew said ahead of the meeting that the Boao Forum provides a platform for
cross-strait economic exchanges and he expressed the hope that mutual
understanding between the two sides could be enhanced and that they would "break
the ice" via this platform.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the much anticipated Hu-Siew meeting, Ho said that an increase in
tourist numbers would indeed bring many economic benefits to Taiwan, including
helping to boost development in the more remote regions.</P>
      <P>However, she expressed the hope that the incoming administration would not rely
solely on an increased number of Chinese tourists to stimulate the local
economy, as such a policy carries inherent risks.</P>
      <P>Noting that the tourism industry is usually one of the first casualties during a
global economic downturn, Ho said the impact of such a downturn on Taiwan would
be massive if the government were to follow such an approach.</P>
      <P>She therefore urged the next administration to adopt an "active" approach to
stimulating Taiwan's economy. She cited the example of Taiwan's high-tech
industry which enjoys many competitive advantages, saying that the government
must actively work to maintain the industry's international competitiveness for
the good of the wider economy.</P>

      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which suffered major setbacks with the
loss of the legislative and presidential elections this year, is attempting to
pick itself up and move forward by engaging in self-examination and internal
reforms.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus announced Saturday that it will begin a series of
public regional meetings Monday to discuss legislative reforms.</P>
      <P>Caucus whip William Lai said the DPP will not be able to perform its duty of
providing checks and balances on the incoming Kuomintang government without
public support and a party caucus that is 100 percent dedicated to its work in
the legislature.</P>
      <P>The victory  by the KMT's Ma Ying-jeou  in the March 22 presidential election
will put the party in control of both the executive and legislative branches of
government following its landslide win earlier in the year of 81 seats to the
DPP's 27 in the 113-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>Lai said that a healthy legislative system is crucial to the DPP's role of
monitoring the incoming KMT government. Lawmakers should have integrity and be
professional, should not hold dual citizenship and should refrain from physical
and verbal attacks during question-and-answer sections, he said, adding that the
DPP will seek to adhere to these standards.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, during a DPP self-examination meeting in the southern city of
Kaohsiung to review its poor performance in the recent elections, grassroots
members harshly criticized the party's leaders, and claimed that factional
conflicts had destroyed the party's spirit and cohesion.</P>
      <P>Similar meeting are being held in other major cities in central and northern
Taiwan, with DPP members spelling out the flaws and missteps of the party that
first came to power when it defeated the KMT in the presidential election in
2000. Since then the DPP and some of its leaders have faced a string of
corruption allegations, which many see as largely responsible for the sharp
decline in the party's popularity.</P>
      <P>The party members at the meetings argued that the DPP, which was founded on
ideals of integrity, has seen its image deteriorate over the past eight years,
especially in the latter part of President Chen Shui-bian's second-term when a
series of scandals surrounding his family members and close aides come to light.</P>
      <P>The party has also failed to fulfill its long-standing goal of forcing the KMT
to return its ill-gotten assets to the national coffers, the critics said.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, who is one of the founding members of the DPP, said
Saturday that he had suggested to President Chen on the day of the recent
presidential election that the leadership of the party should be taken over by
younger party members.</P>
      <P>The DPP will begin registration April 14 of party members who wish to run for
the chairmanship position. Veteran DPP member and Legislator Trong Chai
announced Friday that he will register to stand in the May 18 election for the
post, making him the only member to date openly express an interest in the party
leadership.</P>
      <P>Chang said he believes the "Formosa generation, " which refers to a generation
of pro-democracy activists during the martial law era, should pass the baton of
the party to the younger generation, having completed its mission of pushing
democratic reforms of the country.</P>

      <P>A traditional Japanese Urasenke tea ceremony was held at one of the most typical
Japanese-style buildings in Taiwan Saturday, marking the first time that such a
tea ceremony has been presented here.</P>
      <P>The tea ceremony at the Taiwan Folk Arts Museum (TFAM) building in Taipei City's
Beitou district attracted the attendance of many local scholars, tea lovers and
Japanese culture enthusiasts.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was hosted by Seki Souki of the Urasenke Tradition of Tea, a
prestigious sect of Chado (Japanese Way of Tea) in Japan, in a room that fully
recreated an atmosphere of Japanese culture.</P>
      <P>Because Chado engages the body, mind, and soul, Souki said, "practicing Chado
leads to perfection of speech and behavior."</P>
      <P>Noting that the 1921 Japanese-style wooden structure that houses the TFAM is a
valuable cultural asset, Cecile Wu, director of the museum,  said she hopedthe
program would help locals better understand the essence of Japanese culture."</P>
      <P>According to Wu, through learning and practicing Chado, the tradition  of
making  Japanese  tea,  doing  ikebana  (flower arrangements), aesthetics, the
protocol of tea making and aesthetics are all observed.</P>
      <P>"Each move in Japanese tea making has a specific meaning that is worth learning
and is worthy of appreciation by the Taiwanese people," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shi-nung, an assistant professor of Japanese language and law at Ming Chuan
University, said "experiencing Japanese Chado indeed promotes the publics sense
of propriety."</P>
      <P>Hsu, who began to learn Chado when he was studying for his doctoral degree in
Japan, further explained that because good manners is essential in Japanese tea-
making ceremonies, "practicing Chado helps individuals learn how to use utensils
carefully at home and how to relate well to other people in the society."</P>
      <P>In an attempt to promote the museum and its historical background and to provide
the the public with an opportunity to experience Japanese culture, the TFAM also
launched a special program starting Saturday as a basis for learning Japanese
tea making, Wu said.</P>

      <P>A contest aimed at encouraging smokers to quit was officially launched Saturday,
with organizers announcing that the contestants who succeed in kicking the habit
within the specified time will qualify to draw for a top prize of NT$600,000
(US$19,672).</P>
      <P>The "Quit and Win" campaign was organized jointly by the John Tung Foundation
(JTF) and the Bureau of Health Promotion under the ministerial-level Department
of Health, as part of its effort to promote public health.</P>
      <P>Chen Ying-chun, JTFs vice director of the Tobacco Control Division, said "many
smokers are actually willing to quit this bad habit, " and that "some 20,000
smokers are expected to enroll in the contest."</P>
      <P>Noting that there are an estimated of 4.5 million smokers in Taiwan, which
represents one fifth of the nations population, Hsueh Kuang-chieh, Head of
Tobacco Cessation Clinic, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, said he hoped
"the campaign would help them to stop smoking completely."</P>
      <P>Hsueh said that smoking-related problems cost the government some NT$30 billion
each year to provide treatment, and suggested that deep breathing, drinking cold
water and doing body stretches will help to reduce the desire to smoke."</P>
      <P>I am eager to quit smoking in order to fulfill the promise I made to myself and
my family, " said Liu Chou-hong, one of the contestants who has been smoking for
28 years.</P>
      <P>Lu, who recalled that he lit his first cigarette at the age of 15, said
"quitting smoking would not only make me healthier, but would help me to set a
good example for my 18-year-old son who is also a smoker."</P>
      <P>Andy Chu, a taxi driver who had been a smoker for 30 years before he quit in
2007, told the participants in the campaign that "a strong will and self-

      <P>The Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) being held in southern China's Hainan province is
an "ice-melting journey" for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, said a former
Taiwan official in charge of mainland affairs Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hours before the opening of the meeting, Su Chi, a former chairman of the
Mainland Affairs Council, said the forum will be a place where the two sides can
make friends with each other.</P>
      <P>After the BFA, it will be time to activate a new round of interactions between
the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart,
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) in Beijing, Su
said at a lunch meeting with the media in the Hainan resort of Boao.</P>
      <P>Su is part of Vice President-elect Vincent Siew's BFA delegation, which also
includes Morris Chang, founder and chairman of the world's largest contract chip
maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.; Walsin Lihwa Corp. Chiao You-lun;

      <P>Su said that in the 1990s when the two sides each established a quasi-official
intermediary body to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official
links, technical issues were given priority over political matters.</P>
      <P>However, in the near future, if SEF-ARATS talks resume, the discussions will
touch on every possible issue, including technical and political matters, he
said.</P>
      <P>Asked when the two associations are likely to resume contact, Su said "at least
within one year."</P>
      <P>Siew and his entourage met with Chinese President Hu Jintao Saturday afternoon
soon after the opening ceremony of the two-day forum.</P>
      <P>Siew, who is taking part in the meeting in his capacity as chairman of the
Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation, will host a roundtable discussion
entitled "Prospects for Taiwan's Economy and Cross-Strait Economic Cooperation
and Trade" Sunday, before returning to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The leaders of 11 countries and more than 2,000 Chinese and foreign guests are
participating in the 2008 BFA conference, which is focused on the theme "Green
Asia: Moving Towards Win-Win Through Change."</P>
      <P>The BFA is a non-government international organization committed to promoting
regional economic integration  and bringing Asian countries closer to their
development goals.</P>
      <P>The forum was initiated in 1998 by then-Philippine President Fidel  Ramos,
then-Australian  Prime  Minister  Bob Hawke and then-Japanese Prime Minister
Morihiro Hosokawa. It was formally inaugurated in February 2001.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan on brink of Davis Cup defeat after losing doubles</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's worst Davis Cup nightmare may be coming true.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun and Chen Ti lost the pivotal doubles Saturday to
Kazakhstan's Alexey Kedryuk and Yuriy Schukin 6-2, 6-3, 6-7 (2) , 7-5 in a match
that lasted over three hours to fall behind 2-1 in the best-of-five Asia/Oceania
Zone Group I tie in Almaty.</P>
      <P>Playing in a hostile atmosphere in which the home fans were happy to do what
they could to disrupt the visitors, including making noises as Taiwan's players
served, Chen and Lu were unable to cope with the hard serving Kazakhs, and
especially some brilliant serving and returning of serve from Kedryuk that
belied his 522 ranking.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's players and team captain repeatedly complained to the Iranian chair
umpire to restrain the crowd, but that only further encouraged unruly behavior,
according to members of the Chinese Taipei Tennis Association who are attending
the match.  Lu and Chen recovered from two poor sets and seemed to have righted
themselves by taking the third set in a tiebreaker, but a tiring Chen Ti, coming
off a 3-hour 45-minute marathon singles defeat on Friday, was unable to hold his
serve late in the fourth set, ending Taiwan's hopes of a comeback.</P>
      <P>Lu and Chen will have to win both of Sunday's reverse singles if Taiwan is to
avoid facing a relegation battle in September against the loser of the
Uzbekistan-Philippines tie, not an impossible task since they will be ranked
higher than their opponents.</P>
      <P>But for a team that has long had the potential to be one of Asia's best,
struggling in the relegation playoff round of the eight-country Group I is not
where Taiwan might have expected to be.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the addition of the 127th-ranked Schukin, a Russian who recently
obtained a Kazakhstan passport to become eligible for its Davis Cup team, has
made Taiwan's task much more difficult than expected.</P>
      <P>He defeated Chen in a five-set marathon Friday to even the tie at 1-1, and will
face Lu, ranked 114th, in the first match Sunday.</P>
      <P>If Lu, who has had trouble getting used to what he described as a court that
wasfaster than fast, can overcome the pesky Schukin, the world no. 284 Chen
would have to top the veteran Kedryuk, ranked more than 200 places lowers but
clearly a threat at home on the slick hardcourts.</P>
      <P>Chen was being treated for a sore right shoulder after the doubles, and it was
unclear how healthy he would be if he has to play for the decisive point on
Sunday.  Taiwan was last in Asia/Oceania Group II in 2003 and had seemed more
likely in recent years to contend for a spot in the World Group playoffs, the
entry point to the Davis Cup's elite 16-country World Group, than face
relegation.</P>
      <P>But with one singles defeat in Almaty on Sunday, a relegation battle is exactly
what Taiwan will face.</P>

      <P>The issue of economic exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
dominated the historic meeting between Taiwan's Vice President-elect Vincent
Siew and Chinese President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the 2008 Boao Asian
Forum (BFA) in Hainan, southern China, Saturday.</P>
      <P>The high-profile meeting began 35 minutes later than scheduled as it was delayed
by the opening ceremony of the BFA that was attended by many world political
leaders and former heads of states.</P>
      <P>Television footage showed that Hu shook hands and exchanged greetings with Siew
upon his arrival at the Sofitel hotel where the meeting between Chinese
officials in charge of Taiwan affairs and members of Siew-headed Taiwanese
delegation to the forum took place.</P>
      <P>During the brief greeting, Hu said he was delighted to meet Siew, whom he lauded
as an expert in economic affairs, and expressed the hope of exchanging opinions
with Siew on cross-strait economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Hu told Siew that the two sides needed to make joint efforts to promote cross-
strait economic cooperation and exchanges.</P>
      <P>Calling himself a "veteran soldier" in Taiwan's fight for economic development,
Siew told the Chinese leader that he thought that Taiwan's economy is an
integral part of the economy of Asia, and the global economy as well.</P>
      <P>Over the past two decades, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has grown ever
closer economically,  Siew said,  adding that "the cross-strait economic
development is a common expectation of the people of the two sides, " which is
believed to be able to improve their lives and promote regional peace.</P>
      <P>It is the sixth time that Siew is attending the Boao Forum. He is heading a
delegation comprised of 12 members, including Morris Chang, founder and chairman
of the world's largest contract chip maker -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co.</P>
      <P>Siew, attending the forum in his capacity as chairman of the private Cross-
Strait Common Market Foundation, will preside over a roundtable  meeting on
Taiwan's economy and the prospects  of cross-strait business and trade
development Sunday, before concluding his three-day visit to Hainan.</P>
      <P>While the first seven-minute part of the high-profile 20-minute meeting between
Siew and the Chinese president was open to the media, the rest of the talks was
held behind closed doors.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, a member of Siew's delegation, said afterwards that the Siew-Hu talks
focused on future cross-strait engagements, including opening of direct air
links and opening of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The 2008 World Summit of Indigenous Cultures, the first of its kind in Taiwan,
will open Sunday, focusing on the prominent issue of climate change from the
perspective of the indigenous peoples of the world, the organizers said at
Saturday's opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Indigenous peoples from a dozen countries as well scientific researchers and
scholars have been invited to share their knowledge at the summit, which is
being held under the theme, "Cherishing the Earth, Respecting Ancient Wisdom, "
said the Taiwan Indigenous Cultural Enterprise Development Association (TICEDA),
the main organizer.</P>
      <P>"Global warming is a reality that we are going to have to confront, and the way
that indigenous people live, which means in harmony with nature, can be an
example for modern society," said Alice Takiwatan, director-general of TICEDA.</P>
      <P>Urging people to pay closer attention to the environment and to respect nature,
Takiwatan related a piece of wisdom passed on from her mother, saying that
"human beings cannot joke with the Earth, because it winks its eyes," implying
that nature reacts to human behavior.</P>
      <P>"And now, it's that moment when the Earth winks, " she said.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who was unable to attend the opening ceremony,
conveyed his support for the summit via indigenous Legislator Kung Wen-chi,
stating that the idea of sustainable development has always been a part of
indigenous peoples' lives, and that one of the priorities of his incoming
administration would be to work on environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Ma's and his administration are scheduled to take office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Asked to give an example of indigenous peoples' means of preventing global
warming, Takiwatan said that "leveling the mound and raising that which is low
is not part of indigenous peoples' logic," alluding to their respect for the
order of nature.</P>
      <P>Scholars, followers of different religions and sects, along with indigenous
peoples from countries such as the Philippines, United States, England,
Singapore and Myanmar, will also discuss during the two-day summit topics like
development of indigenous enterprise and their contemporary belief system,
according to TICEDA.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the government officially recognizes 13 indigenous tribes that
represent 484,000 people, or about 2.1 percent of the total population of the
country.</P>

to learn about Taiwan's traditions.</P>

period in 1914 by a tea merchant and used as a meeting place for local gentry,

topics, economics and the environment.</P>
      <P>It was Siew's sixth time at the annual forum, but his first time seated in the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Vice President-elect Vincent Siew brought up four requests in his
historic talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao Saturday, with improving
economic relations as main focus, according to Siew's spokesman.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, a top China policy planner in Taiwan's former Kuomintang (KMT)
government who is accompanying Siew on his current visit to China, told
reporters that Siew had called for normalization of cross-Taiwan Strait trade
exchanges and resumption of bilateral dialogue mechanism in his talks with the
top Chinese leader.</P>
      <P>Siew also requested that China allow its citizens to make sightseeing trips to
Taiwan as early as possible and open direct cross-strait charter flights on
weekends as a prelude to the establishment of direct air links, Su said.</P>
      <P>The historic Siew-Hu meeting took place on the sidelines of the Boao Forum for
Asia (BFA) which opened Saturday with regional economic cooperation as its top
theme.</P>
      <P>The meeting was the highest-level cross-strait political contact since the
Republic of China government moved its seat to Taiwan in 1949. Never before has
an ROC president-elect or vice president-elect set foot on mainland China soil.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the 20-minute Siew-Hu meeting focused on improving economic
relations, a key plank in the platform that boosted incoming Vice President
Vincent Siew and President-elect Ma Ying-jeou to victory in the March 22
presidential poll.</P>
      <P>"The 20-minute talks started with Hu making brief welcoming remarks, which were
followed by Siew's presentation in detail and then Hu's response, " explained
Su, who is now a professor and widely tipped to be the new KMT government's top
national security adviser.</P>
      <P>The first seven minutes of the Siew-Hu meeting was open to the media but the
rest of talks proceeded behind closed doors.</P>
      <P>According to China's official Xinhua news agency, Hu met with Siew in his
capacity as the general secretary of the Communist Party of China. He was
accompanied by Chinese officials in charge of Taiwan affairs during the meeting.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Siew, who will take office May 20, is visiting China in his
capacity as chairman of the private Taipei-based Cross-Straits Common Market
Foundation (CSCMF) . The 12-member CSCMF delegation headed by Siew is composed
of academics and business executives.</P>
      <P>The Siew-Hu meeting is expected to mark a watershed  for cross-strait relations
that have been stalled since 1999 when then-President Lee Teng-hui declared
cross-strait relations as a special state-to-state relationship. The Ma-Siew
ticket campaigned on a platform of better economy and closer cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>After exchanging  pleasantries  with the Siew-headed  CSCMF delegation, Hu said
improving relations between the two sides requires efforts from both parties.</P>
      <P>"On this occasion, I'm happy to exchange opinions on the cross-strait economic
cooperation with Siew," Hu said, adding that he looks forward to seeing the two
sides forge consensus amid changes in regional and global situations.</P>
      <P>Hu further said the enthusiastic participation of delegates from around the
world to the Boao forum reflects a strong desire of Asian countries and areas to
strengthen exchanges and cooperation and create mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>"This common aspiration has provided an important inspiration for our two sides
in considering how to boost bilateral economic exchanges," Hu said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Siew said reality has proved that cross-strait economic
development is the common wish of people on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>He expressed hopes that Taiwan and China would set aside their disputes with
pragmatism and work together to create a bright future that will see a win-win
scenario.</P>
      <P>"I hope our two sides will face reality, set sights on the future, put aside
disputes and pursue a win-win scenario for all parties concerned," Siew said.</P>
      <P>Noting that it's not easy for him to attend the Boao forum this time around,
Siew said he keenly hopes the two sides can from now on adopt a pragmatic and
open-minded attitude in dealing with bilateral affairs to turn a new page for
cross-strait relations that are based on "mutual trust, mutual understanding,
mutual help and mutual benefits."</P>
      <P>Responding to Siew's proposals, Hu was quoted by Xinhua news agency  as having
promised  to continue  promoting  bilateral negotiations on opening of weekend
cross-strait charter flights and on issues regarding Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the end of the meeting, Hu also asked Siew to convey his regards to Taiwan's
president-elect Ma Ying-jeou, KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and KMT honorary
chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Hu was further quoted as having stressed that in the face of ever more ferrous
global economic competition, the two sides should seized the current hard-won
opportunities to create a win-win scenario for both sides.</P>
      <P>The Boao Forum is a non-government, not-profit organization aimed to promote
regional economic cooperation. Founded in 2001, it is headquartered in Beijing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Vice President-elect Vincent Siew said late Saturday that he was
satisfied with courteous reception that China has accorded him at an economic
forum being held in the southern Chinese resort of Boao in Hainan province.</P>
      <P>Siew, the running mate of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , made the remarks after attending a dinner hosted by Chinese
President Hu Jintao in honor of all participants to the Boao Forum for Asia
(BFA).</P>
      <P>"I'm satisfied with all the warm hospitality and courteous treatment extended to
me by forum organizers, " Siew told Taiwanese reporters covering his current
landmark visit.</P>
      <P>Siew is the first Taiwanese vice president-elect ever to set foot on Chinese
soil. Although he is attending the forum in his capacity as chairman of the
private Taipei-based Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation (CSCMF) , China sent
a charter plane to Hong Kong to take him and his 12-member entourage to Boao, a
lavish treatment befitting his status as a country's incoming vice president.</P>
      <P>On Saturday afternoon, Siew met Hu in the highest-level political contact across
the Taiwan Strait in nearly 60 years.</P>
      <P>Siew, who, along with Ma, will take office May 20, said he keenly hopes his
20-minute talks with Hu will contribute to peaceful development on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait which separates Taiwan from China.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Siew said he proposed that the two sides "face reality, set
sights on the future, shelve disputes and pursue a win-win scenario."</P>
      <P>"The essence of my suggestion is that cross-strait affairs should be addressed
with pragmatism and openness, " Siew said, adding that all his opinions
expressed during the meeting have received Hu's positive response.</P>
      <P>Siew recalled that when he bade farewell to Hu at the end of the dinner, Hu told
him that their meeting in the afternoon was "very meaningful."</P>
      <P>Describing Hu's comments as offering a "historic opportunity" for improving
cross-strait ties, which have been stalled for eight years due to China's
unwillingness to hold dialogue with Taiwan's incumbent pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party administration, Siew said the two sides should
start with tackling economic issues while putting political disputes on the back
burner.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su Chi, a former Mainland Affairs Council chairman who was also
present at the Siew-Hu meeting, portrayed the talks as "candid and friendly"
with "harmonious chemistry."</P>
      <P>According to Su, Siew brought up four requests during the talks, including
resumption of cross-strait dialogue, normalization of bilateral trade and
economic ties, launch of weekend cross-strait charter flights and opening of
Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that cross-strait negotiation will resume soon and weekend
cross-strait charter flights could take off in early July, " Su forecast
optimistically, adding that it is almost sure that spring is in sight.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Vice President-elect Vincent Siew brought up four requests in his
historic talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao Saturday, with improving
economic relations as main focus, according to Siew's spokesman.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, a top China policy planner in Taiwan's former Kuomintang (KMT)
government who is accompanying Siew on his current visit to China, told
reporters that Siew had called for normalization of cross-Taiwan Strait trade
exchanges and resumption of bilateral dialogue mechanism in his talks with the
top Chinese leader.</P>
      <P>Siew also requested that China allow its citizens to make sightseeing trips to
Taiwan as early as possible and open direct cross-strait charter flights on
weekends as a prelude to the establishment of direct air links, Su said.</P>
      <P>The historic Siew-Hu meeting took place on the sidelines of the Boao Forum for
Asia (BFA) which opened Saturday with regional economic cooperation as its top
theme.</P>
      <P>The meeting was the highest-level cross-strait political contact since the
Republic of China government moved its seat to Taiwan in 1949. Never before has
an ROC president-elect or vice president-elect set foot on mainland China soil.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the 20-minute Siew-Hu meeting focused on improving economic
relations, a key plank in the platform that boosted incoming Vice President
Vincent Siew and President-elect Ma Ying-jeou to victory in the March 22
presidential poll.</P>
      <P>"The 20-minute talks started with Hu making brief welcoming remarks, which were
followed by Siew's presentation in detail and then Hu's response, " explained
Su, who is now a professor and widely tipped to be the new KMT government's top
national security adviser.</P>
      <P>The first seven minutes of the Siew-Hu meeting was open to the media but the
rest of talks proceeded behind closed doors.</P>
      <P>According to China's official Xinhua news agency, Hu met with Siew in his
capacity as the general secretary of the Communist Party of China. He was
accompanied by Chinese officials in charge of Taiwan affairs during the meeting.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Siew, who will take office May 20, is visiting China in his
capacity as chairman of the private Taipei-based Cross-Straits Common Market
Foundation (CSCMF) . The 12-member CSCMF delegation headed by Siew is composed
of academics and business executives.</P>
      <P>The Siew-Hu meeting is expected to mark a watershed  for cross-strait relations
that have been stalled since 1999 when then-President Lee Teng-hui declared
cross-strait relations as a special state-to-state relationship. The Ma-Siew
ticket campaigned on a platform of better economy and closer cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>After exchanging  pleasantries  with the Siew-headed  CSCMF delegation, Hu said
improving relations between the two sides requires efforts from both parties.</P>
      <P>"On this occasion, I'm happy to exchange opinions on the cross-strait economic
cooperation with Siew," Hu said, adding that he looks forward to seeing the two
sides forge consensus amid changes in regional and global situations.</P>
      <P>Hu further said the enthusiastic participation of delegates from around the
world to the Boao forum reflects a strong desire of Asian countries and areas to
strengthen exchanges and cooperation and create mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>"This common aspiration has provided an important inspiration for our two sides
in considering how to boost bilateral economic exchanges," Hu said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Siew said reality has proved that cross-strait economic
development is the common wish of people on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>He expressed hopes that Taiwan and China would set aside their disputes with
pragmatism and work together to create a bright future that will see a win-win
scenario.</P>
      <P>"I hope our two sides will face reality, set sights on the future, put aside
disputes and pursue a win-win scenario for all parties concerned," Siew said.</P>
      <P>Noting that it's not easy for him to attend the Boao forum this time around,
Siew said he keenly hopes the two sides can from now on adopt a pragmatic and
open-minded attitude in dealing with bilateral affairs to turn a new page for
cross-strait relations that are based on "mutual trust, mutual understanding,
mutual help and mutual benefits."</P>
      <P>Responding to Siew's proposals, Hu was quoted by Xinhua news agency  as having
promised  to continue  promoting  bilateral negotiations on opening of weekend
cross-strait charter flights and on issues regarding Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the end of the meeting, Hu also asked Siew to convey his regards to Taiwan's
president-elect Ma Ying-jeou, KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and KMT honorary
chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Hu was further quoted as having stressed that in the face of ever more ferrous
global economic competition, the two sides should seized the current hard-won
opportunities to create a win-win scenario for both sides.</P>
      <P>The Boao Forum is a non-government, not-profit organization aimed to promote
regional economic cooperation. Founded in 2001, it is headquartered in Beijing.</P>

      <P>The 2008 Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) opened Saturday in Boao, a resort city on the
southern Chinese island of Hainan, with Taiwan Vice President-elect Vincent Siew
joining business leaders and many other international political figures,
including former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, to discuss, among other
topics, economics and the environment.</P>
      <P>It was Siew's sixth time at the annual forum, but his first time seated in the
front row reserved for VIPs. Siew was seated between Volvo Group Chief Executive
Officer Leif Johnansson, on his left, and Chen Jinhua, vice chairman of the
ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, on his right.</P>
      <P>Powell sat next to Chen at the opening, while Chinese President Hu Jintao was
seated center stage between 10 other heads of state.</P>
      <P>The forum is being attended by over 1,000 world political and business leaders,
as well as former heads of states. However, Siew, who is participating in the
meeting in his capacity as chairman of the Cross-Straits Common Market
Foundation,  was the focus of attention for the Taiwanese reporters covering the
event, who appeared to be anticipating some interaction between him and Hu.</P>
      <P>The theme of the BFA conference this year is "Green Asia: Moving Towards Win-Win
Through Change."</P>
      <P>The BFA is a non-government international organization committed to promoting
regional economic integration  and bringing Asian countries closer to their
development goals.</P>
      <P>The forum was initiated in 1998 by then-Philippine President Fidel  Ramos,
then-Australian  Prime  Minister  Bob Hawke and then-Japanese Prime Minister
Morihiro Hosokawa. It was formally inaugurated in February 2001.</P>

      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew met with former U.S. Secretary of State Colin
Powell for a brief talk Sunday on the sidelines of the 2008 Boao Forum for Asia,
which opened in the southern Chinese resort city a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Powell met Siew for a meeting that lasted about 20 minutes. After the talk,
Powell praised Siew's landmark meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao
Saturday, saying it was "very good news for the region."</P>
      <P>Powell told reporters that "the two sides have begun down a new path.... I think
we are at the beginning of a new phase in relations between the parties in
Asia."</P>
      <P>He said that Siew has been one of his Asian friends for years, adding that he

as the president and vice president in the Taiwan presidential poll held March
22. Ma and Siew are slated to take office May 20.</P>
      <P>For his part, Siew told the reporters that he had extended an invitation, on
behalf of President-elect Ma, to Powell to attend their inauguration May 20 in
Taiwan. Powell responded that "he would love to attend the inauguration ceremony

      <P>Siew said Powell had visited Taiwan before and that he has a great impression of

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City Government held a healthy baby competition featuring over 300
children under five years of age Sunday to promote public awareness of the
importance of breast-feeding and regular monitoring of child development.</P>
      <P>The2008 Healthy Baby Competition" was the second of its kind organized by Wyeth
Taiwan Corporation and BabyHome Web site, under the supervision of the Taipei
City Government's Department of Health.</P>
      <P>These young participants were divided into four groups to compete in various
activities, including crawling, rolling balls and matching color balls. The
categories were chosen to highlight parent-child interaction and to assess
muscle and cognitive development.</P>
      <P>"Healthy babies are those who receive their vaccinations on time, have regular
physical and child development examinations and are breast fed," said Lin Hsiu-
liang, deputy director of the department.</P>
      <P>She advised that parents should make sure their children have</P>
      <P>regular check-ups so that the babies can be treated if there is</P>
      <P>any sign of developmental delay.</P>
      <P>Developmental delay is defined as a child lagging behind in areas such as motor,
language, social, or thinking skills, which means he or she is not reaching
developmental landmarks at the expected age.</P>
      <P>According to the World Health Organization, 6-8 percent of children aged zero to
six years old suffer developmental delay, and in Taiwan the number is at least
100,000 children under the age of six, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin called on all new parents to breast feed their babies, saying it is the best
first food for infants.</P>
      <P>Research has shown that breast milk is perfectly suited to nourish infants,
protect them from illness and promote the development of intelligence," she
said.</P>
      <P>In the baby crawling competition, the parents were even busier than their six-
month to one-year-old babies, using pacifiers, stuffed toys, keys or even cell
phones to get the attention of the children and encourage them to move to the
finish line.</P>
      <P>" Being part of this competition can create great memories between our baby and
us," said Yao Shin-yi, the mother of an eight-month-old competitor wearing a
camouflage head scarf.</P>
      <P>The organizers of the competition also set up counseling booths to provide a
wide range of health information to parents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Long beloved Kapok trees cause headaches in Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/13/08  16:40:01</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA Staff Reporter</P>
      <P>Taipei, April 13 (CNA) Spring has arrived in Taiwan and with it the dilemma over
what to do with the island's many kapok trees, whose beautiful flowers are
inspiring some local governments to plant them to promote tourism, while
irritating motorists and others to no end.</P>
      <P>The problem involving the trees -- known for their large, beautiful, lily-like
flowers -- is turning out to be a battle between nature and modernization. It
also reveals the changes in Taiwanese society over the decades.</P>
      <P>In April, the large trees, which grow to about 60 meters tall, enter their
blooming season. Palm size blossoms in colors of red, pink or orange make
picture perfect backdrops for photos, but they are a headache as the pedals fall
to the ground, causing scooter drivers as well as pedestrians to slip and fall.</P>
      <P>Fallen flowers also get stuck on windshields and the flying cotton-like fillings
of the large seed pods that form on the trees a month after the flowers bloom
irritate people with respiratory problems. Ripe pods, the size of big mangoes,
open up to release cotton-like fillings with little seeds, which are carried by
the wind and fly around in the air. Some people also complain that the flowers
stink after being crushed by cars on the roads.</P>
      <P>City, county and township governments in many parts of Taiwan are torn over what
to do about the problem after getting frequent complaints by local residents
about problems innocently caused by the trees.</P>
      <P>Many local governments of where the kapok trees are found are faced with having
to decide whether to spend lots of time and effort maintaining the trees where
they are or removing them and risk harming the roots and killing them in the
process.</P>
      <P>Those who despise the trees and those who love them are in a tug of war.</P>
      <P>A dispute over whether or not to remove the trees in Tungshih township in
central Taiwan's Taichung County still has not been resolved after festering
for three years.  Six village heads complained about the trees on behalf of
local residents and appealed to the township office to cut down about 900 kapok
trees in 2005.</P>
      <P>Thanks to increasing awareness of the importance of ecological protection,
tourism promotion, as well as consideration of public's affection for the trees,
the government chose transplantation, said Chen Ching-tung, the township
office's construction section chief.</P>
      <P>The  Taichung  County-based  Ecological  Conservation  and Environmental
Protection Association of Ta-Chia Stream urged the local government to leave the
trees where they are, arguing that not that many people are bothered by them and
that transplantation might still jeopardize the life of these trees as they had
stood where they were for three decades.</P>
      <P>"The roots of the trees  could  be impaired  during  the transplantation
process, which will lead to them dying, " said an executive of the association.</P>
      <P>Kapoks, also known as Ceiba or Silk Cotton trees, were once a star on Taiwan's
floral list, voted as the official flower of Taiwan's second largest city,
Kaohsiung, as well as Taichung County by local residents in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>The local governments of Kaohsiung and Taichung began planting the trees in wide
areas following the vote, aiming to formulate people's identity with the places
where they live.</P>
      <P>The tree rose in people's heart in 1978, when Taiwan was riding the wave of a
folk song era. A song titled "Kapok Tree Road" that relates the red kapok
blossoms with nostalgic love impressed the old and young.</P>
      <P>As the song, sung by then famous singer Wang Mung-lin, goes, "the long road
burns with blooming blossoms and that passionate love vanishes quickly as
flaming red kapok blossoms wither and fall after its season passes."</P>
      <P>The tree also had practical uses in people's lives at a time when many Taiwanese
were poor. Its flowers, pods, and "silk cotton" pod fillings served as
children's toys decades ago, when Taiwan had not yet seen so much economic and
modern development and children did not have expensive hand-held computer games
and other toys as they do now.</P>
      <P>Housewives would make food or teas with the kapok petals, and use its silk-
cotton as filling material for pillows, but such use is no longer seen as
imported cotton can be easily purchased in stores.</P>
      <P>As trees were widely planted and Taiwanese society became more modern, people
started to notice how the tree got in the way of their daily life during the
blooming season from March until May.</P>
      <P>However, as the kapok, introduced from India to Taiwan in the 17th century, is
deeply connected with many people's childhood memories and recollections of a
bygone era, many people do not want to see the trees uprooted from where they
had survived for hundreds of years, existing alongside humans with few problems.</P>
      <P>In Tatu, another township in Taichung County, transplantation has not been
enough to iron out the dispute between those who love the trees and those who
wish they were gone. The township had 960 kapok trees in schools and main roads
removed to a park last year, but complaints about the same problems still exist,
with some county councilors pointing out that the park is not far enough away
from densely populated areas for the petals and silk cotton to not be a
nuisance.</P>
      <P>Another place in Taichung County, Fengyuan City, chose to send fire brigade
wagons to "shoot down" ripe seeds with water hoses to prevent the silk-cotton
from flying around once the seed pods open.</P>
      <P>"Taichung County now has less than 3,000 kapok trees remaining on main roads,
not including the 960 already transplanted, " said Lin Hung-wen, chief of the
county's road maintenance section.</P>
      <P>While the issue of finding a home for kapok trees remains a debate in Taichung
County, central Taiwan's Changhua County is trying to use the trees to promote
tourism, seeing them as an attraction.</P>
      <P>Changhua County's Pitou township kicked off its first campaign last week to
promote tourism during the Kapok tree flowering season along a 4.5-km riverside
road, which has about 670 kapok trees.</P>
      <P>They timed the campaign during Taiwan's Tomb Sweeping Festival in hopes of
drawing  more tourists  and boosting  local economic development.</P>
      <P>A series of activities were held to celebrate the flower season, with local
schools performing music and dance and presenting sweet broths and cakes made of
kapok blossoms.</P>
      <P>"We are hoping that the flower season will help create business opportunities
for local industries, " said Pitou township head Chen Tsang-chiung, adding that
since the flower season appears to be attracting a lot of visitors, the township
office has decided to plant more kapok trees on the other side of the same road
to create a grander view.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had 3.71 million visitors, including tourists, in 2007, up 5.58 percent
from 2006's figure, but the number is considered low. The Tourism Bureau plans
to increase visitor numbers to 4.25 million in 2009.</P>
      <P>Domestic travel by Taiwanese people is also increasing, showing a promising
future in tourism promotion.</P>
      <P>Many local governments now actively plan activities related to local cultural or
natural resources, with the aim of attracting more visitors to boost the local
economy.</P>
      <P>Advocates of keeping the kapok trees said they hope the awareness of tourism
promotion will create a way out for the kapok. The fate of the trees in many
other areas, however, remains unknown.</P>
      <P>Regardless of whether it is decided that the trees should remain or be
transplanted, efforts are needed to take care of the trees to ensure they are in
good health.</P>
      <P>An executive of the Ecological Conservation and Environmental Protection
Association of Ta-Chia Stream pointed out that without proper care and a good
place for transplantation, the trees, even if they are removed to a new place,
would still cause the same problems, especially as those areas develop and
become more densely populated.</P>
      <P>"When the problems happen again after removal, where should the trees be moved
to?" said the executive.</P>
      <P>Tungshih Township, which still has not decided whether or not to transplant the
trees, now that the community has cleaning teams to clean fallen flowers
everyday and will prune the pods to prevent the silk-cotton from flying and
dancing with the wind.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the township office will hold a public hearing next month
inviting representatives from different sectors to decide whether to move the
trees or not.</P>
      <P>"No big complaints have been made recently, but the problem still has to be
solved, " said Chen.</P>

      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus leader said Sunday that
although it was yet unclear what results the meeting between Taiwan's vice
President-elect and the Chinese president  would produce,  the exchange was
definitely conducive to the development of cross-strait ties in the future.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Kuo-liang, an acting KMT legislative caucus whip, said he welcomed the
meeting between Taiwan's Vice President-elect Vincent Siew and Chinese President
Hu Jintao Saturday, which took place on the sidelines of the 2008 Boao Forum for
Asia in Hainan, China.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said although the KMT caucus would not be able to determine the tone of
Siew's "ice thawing" participation in the Boao Forum until the vice-president
elect returns to Taiwan, it views the amicable Hu-Siew meeting as a historic
event that would significantly contribute to the development of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh blasted Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tong
for adhering to what he called the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration's approach of shutting off Taiwan from the international
community by refusing to engage in any kind of exchanges with China.</P>
      <P>"It would be pathetic if Chen chose to stick to the DPP's closed-door policy
until the last day, May 20, when the incoming KMT government takes over," Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>If Chen is indeed a responsible official in charge of formulating Taiwan's China
policy, he should take the time to obtain a better understanding of the incoming
government's cross-strait policies and its needs so that he could help the MAC
administer the measures that would be introduced by the KMT, Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the historic Hu-Siew meeting, Vice President Annette Lu said
the meeting could help ease cross-strait tensions, which had intensified since
Taiwan launched referendums on the country's bid to enter the United Nations
under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lu also called for the country not to fuss too much over how Siew was treated at
the meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao, saying that she thinks Siew was
met with proper etiquette in his capacity as a leading KMT figure, while Hu met
with him in Hu's capacity as general secretary of the Communist Party of China.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) will elevate a 17.15 km section of
railway in northern Taiwan to improve transport efficiency and services as part
of its strategy to cope with competition from the Taiwan High Speed Rail.</P>
      <P>According to TRA executives, the project to elevate the railway section between
Yingge township in Taipei County and Chungli City in Taoyuan County will
eliminate 17 grade crossings, and the three current stations at Taoyuan, Neili
and Chungli will be replaced by new elevated stations.</P>
      <P>The project will also add five new stations between Yingge and Chungli at an
interval of about two kilometers between every two stations to facilitate
commuters. The decision was made in accordance with the TRA's policy to operate
the railway more like a metro system.</P>
      <P>The entire project will carry a price tag of NT$30.8 billion (US$1.02 billion)
and will take seven and a half years to complete.</P>
      <P>The 120-year-old railway network in Taiwan's west corridor has lost 33 percent
of its long-distance passengers since the High Speed Rail became operational in
January 2007. The 345-km high speed rail linking Taipei and Kaohsiung has
reduced travel time between Taiwan's two largest cities from four-and-a-half
hours to 90 minutes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP-elect's China visit should benefit all: spokesman</HEADLINE>

      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew is expected to return home bearing the fruits
of his China visit, which should benefit all fellow citizens, not just his own
party or any specific individual, an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey made the remarks a day after Siew, the
running mate of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), had a historic meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao on the sidelines
of an annual global economic forum being held in the southern Chinese resort of
Boao in Hainan province.</P>
      <P>"As a vice president-elect, Siew represents Taiwan. We would like to see
substantial results from his current China trip. Nevertheless, any fruitful
outcome should be beneficial to all compatriots, not just the KMT or the Ma-Siew
ticket," Shieh said.</P>
      <P>The KMT once ruled all of China before fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war to the Chinese communists, and Siew is the first Republic of China
vice president-elect ever to set foot on Chinese soil since then.</P>
      <P>Shieh reminded Siew not to take any steps or make any statements during his stay
in China that could mislead the world into perceiving his visit as the
"beginning of reconciliation" between the two civil war rivals -- the KMT and
the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Since the KMT lost power to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2000,
Shieh said, the KMT has often sung a duet with the Beijing government, accusing
the pro-independence DPP government of being a troublemaker.</P>
      <P>"This time around, if the Chinese leaders criticize the DPP government, Siew
should remain silent or just respond with his trademark smile because he is no
longer a private citizen but instead is representing Taiwan," Shieh urged.</P>
      <P>Shieh also derided as "too self-deprecating" some media reports that interpreted
Siew's seating in the front row along with the top leaders from several
participating countries at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia
Saturday as a sign of China's "tacit recognition" of his status as Taiwan's
incoming vice president.</P>
      <P>"Seating arrangements at such an occasion mean little. We should never forget
that it is China that has spared no effort to suppress and belittle Taiwan in
the international arena since 1971 when the People's Republic of China took over
the 'China' seat in the United Nations at the expense of the R.O.C.," Shieh
noted.</P>
      <P>The incoming KMT government should push China not to block Taiwan's bid to
obtain seats in major world organizations, including the U.N. and the World
Health Organization, he added.</P>
      <P>Siew left for Boao Friday to attend the annual Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) in his
capacity as chairman of the private Taipei-based Cross-Straits Common Market
Foundation. The three-day forum brought together some 2,000 dignitaries from
major countries around the world,  including  political  leaders,  academics
and business executives, to discuss matters related to Asia regional economic
integration and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Saturday's Siew-Hu meeting was the highest-level  political contact across the
Taiwan Strait in nearly 60 decades. It was also widely seen as a watershed  in
the long-stalled  cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Despite a thaw in the early 1990s, cross-strait engagements have sunk to a low
ebb since 1999 when then-President Lee Teng-hui declared cross-strait ties as
special state-to-state relations. Because of Beijing's unwillingness to
negotiate with the pro-independence DPP administration, cross-strait ties have
remained deep-frozen over the past eight years.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Vice President Annette Lu said Sunday she would recognize
Siew's contribution if his historic meeting with Hu could truly help defuse
cross-strait tensions and usher in a new era of peaceful cross-strait
development and co-existence.</P>
      <P>On Siew's proposal to Hu that the two sides shelve disputes with pragmatism and
work together to create a win-win scenario, Lu said it is "easier said than
done" and that the success of such an initiative depends on China's sincerity to
take concrete action.</P>
      <P>"We should keep close watch on the development," Lu said, adding that she hopes
the incoming KMT government would listen to different opinions from various
quarters, including political parties, in dealing with cross-strait affairs.</P>

      <P>The rate of organ donation in Taiwan is not as good as it could be due to
cultural obstacles, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Saturday at a commemoration
ceremony to honor those who had decided before they died to donate their organs.</P>
      <P>Hu presided over the unveiling of a plaque that commemorated organ donors, while
recipients presented bouquets of flowers to the families of donors, at ceremony
held at China Medical University in the central city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>Hu expressed gratitude to the families of the organ donors, and noted that there
was still ample room for improvement in organ donation rates and in overcoming
the psychological barriers to organ donation.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan faces various obstacles to promoting organ donation, " Hu said, citing
the example of the cultural belief in keeping body intact after death so that
the deceased could enter the spirit world.</P>
      <P>Hu said that it is also a common view that requesting organ donation immediately
after the death of a potential donor deepens the surviving family's grief.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that some people are reluctant to have organ transplants as
they fear transplant failure.</P>
      <P>Even though it is difficult to change the public mindset against organ donation,
government agencies and the private sector has a responsibility to help raise
awareness of the importance of organ donation in saving lives, Hu added.</P>

      <P>Nineteen members from various U.S. print media outlets expressed amazement at
the high concentration of heritage sites and the spectacular coastal scenery in
Danshui, during a tour of the township in the northern county Saturday.</P>
      <P>The press corps from some 10 prominent  American outlets, including the New York
Times and the Washington  Post,  were accompanied by Taipei County Magistrate
Chou Hsi-wei on the second day of their Taiwan trip.</P>
      <P>Chou, in the dual role of tour guide and head of the host county, spared no
effort to pitch the many scenic attractions of the area to the foreign guests,
who had been given a tour of Taipei City a day before.</P>
      <P>Speaking in English, Chou detailed the history of Danshui, beginning with the
shore on which George Leslie Mackay -- a Canadian missionary well known and
remembered in Taiwan for his work in the fields of religion, education --
disembarked in Danshui in 1872.</P>
      <P>Chou mentioned many other sites of historical significance and also talked about
the county's achievements  in infrastructure construction. He exchanged views
with the media professionals on travel experiences and solicited their opinions
on Taiwan's future development.</P>
      <P>He said he hoped that "Taipei County will become better known to the world"
through the introduction of the American journalists from various influential
media establishments.</P>
      <P>During the two-hour tour, the delegation visited Mackay Mission Hospital,
Danshui Church, Little White House, Oxford College, Danshui High School's
"eight-cornered tower" and Fort San Domingo.</P>
      <P>Members of the press corps praised Danshui as an attractive destination, with
its great number of historic sites, diversified transportation system and
variety of local delicacies. They promised to develop a series of reports that

      <P>Kurt Wisner, a senior National Geographic Explorer reporter, described the

      <P>Taiwan is poised to join a regional action to turn off the lights in some cities
for one hour June 21 in an effort to raise environmental awareness, an
environmental group announced Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Society of Wilderness, Taiwan (SOW) announced that it had reached an
agreement with its counterparts  in Hong Kong and Guangdong, China Sunday on an
energy conservation plan that would see Hong Kong,  Taipei,  Taichung,
Kaohsiung and Guangdong cities extinguish household lights and the exterior
lights on public buildings for an hour on the night of June 21.</P>
      <P>"More than 1 million people are expected to join this significant lights-out
plan June 21, as other civil groups, from Beijing and Japan, that champion
environmental protection have also promised to participate," said SOW officials.</P>
      <P>According to the SOW, some 650,000 people around Taiwan joined a lights-out
campaign last June 21, with more than 100 public buildings of local governments,
high-tech companies at Hsinchu-based Science Park,  high-speed  railway
stations,  Taipei 101 building  and Kaohsiung's Love River turning off
unnecessary exterior lighting.</P>
      <P>The 2007 lights-out campaign, which lasted about 70 minutes, saved a total of
300,000 kwh of electricity, roughly equivalent to a reduction of 187 tons of
carbon dioxide emissions at the time, according to the SOW officials.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping to save energy and reduce global warming, the lights-out
campaign is also aimed at encouraging consumers to support corporations and
public organizations that demonstrate a greater willingness to save energy, SOW
officials said.</P>
      <P>This year's campaign, which marks summer solstice and is the fourth in a row, is
also inviting ordinary households to join the effort by turning off their lights
that night, the officials added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that China had invited Vice President-elect
Vincent Siew to attend a regional economic forum in southern China as a
diversion in the face of international pressure over its suppression of Tibet.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had received reports that claimed Siew originally did not want to
take part in the forum, but later changed his mind and submitted an application
after the deadline because China had extended an invitation to him.</P>
      <P>Siew, the first Taiwan vice president-elect ever to set foot on Chinese soil,
said prior to his visit that he planned to attend the annual forum April 11-13
in his capacity as chairman of the private Taipei-based Cross-Straits Common
Market Foundation (CSCMF) , as he had done in the past five years.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said at an alumni meeting of the Taipei-based Ketagalan Institute
that Siew's visit to China was an attempt by Beijing to divert the attention of
the international community, in much the same way that it did three years ago
when it passed an anti-secession law.</P>
      <P>The anti-secession law authorized Beijing to use force against Taiwan if it
declares formal independence from China.</P>
      <P>In 2005, two leaders of Taiwan's opposition parties -- Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Lien Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong -- were invited to

Gate 2, will take turns to entertain patients at Taiwan's hospitals with 19
performances this year as part of Cloud Gate's 35th anniversary celebrations.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Hwai-min, founder and artistic director of Taiwan's first

shows in the lobbies of 18 hospitals in Taipei, Hsinchu, Chiayi, Tainan and
Kaohsiung between April 11 and Oct. 24.</P>
      <P>One of the shows is Moon Water, which Lin created in 1998 on inspiration from a
Buddhist proverb: "Flowers in a mirror and moon on the water are both illusive."
The dance has been integrated with Tai Chi moves and is performed to the music
of Bach's Suites for Solo Cello.</P>
      <P>Other shows to be staged  include  parts of the troupe's productions "Tantalus,"
"Love Story" and "Body, Sound."</P>
      <P>Cloud Gate Dance Troupe 1, founded in 1973, now focuses more on international
touring while Cloud Gate 2, founded in 1999 to cultivate young choreographers,
performs mainly in local communities.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although the two troupes are extremely busy with domestic and
overseas performance tours this year, they have managed to find time for the

      <P>The Taipei City Government, along with a television channel and a department
store, launched an event in Taipei Sunday, in recognition of Earth Day April 22,
at which they called on the general public to use non-disposable chopsticks to
help save the earth.</P>
      <P>The earth is not just in high fever it's also suffering from lung disease," said
Taipei City governments Bureau of Environment Protection Director Stephen Shen,
referring to the effects of global warming and deforestation.</P>
      <P>One thousand trees are cut down to make the 2.8 million chopsticks used in
Taiwan each day, said Shen, urging the public to start using non-disposable
chopsticks as a way to save the earth.</P>
      <P>He said that the Taipei City Government might introduce a law to restrict some
businesses, such as convenience stores, from dispensing disposable chopsticks.</P>
      <P>If the six billion people on earth could all stop using disposable dining
utensils, we would becomegood bacteriaon the earth and help it to get better
much faster, " he added, sticking to the analogy of a sick person.</P>
      <P>Shen also read a "statement from a dying tree" in Hsinyi New Life Square that
urged the use of non-disposable chopsticks, which he said represented the
"views" of all those trees that had been hewn down to make disposable
chopsticks.</P>
      <P>Shen, along with Home Box Office (HBO) Singapore Senior Director Caroline Wong
and Yang Tsung-rong, store manager of the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi Department Store
Xinyi Branch, wrote on tree leaves their commitments to save the earth. The
leaves will be hung on the four-meter tall dying tree as symbol of its
restoration to life.</P>
      <P>Because we are going to show the film -- An Inconvenient Truth -- on Earth Day,
this is a great time for us to try to get the Taiwanese people involved in doing
something to save the earth,said Wong.</P>
      <P>Since disposable chopsticks are used a lot in Taiwan, we feel that it would be
appropriate for everyone to switch to chopsticks that can be reused," she added.</P>
      <P>Yang said that the campaign, dubbed "One pair of reusable chopsticks -- together
we can save the earth," will last from April 10 to 22, and anyone who spends
NT$200 (US$7) in the department store's food court can get a free pair of
reusable chopsticks and contribute the protection of the environment.</P>
      <P>Earth Day was founded by environmental activist John McConnell in 1969 to
inspire awareness of and appreciation for the Earths environment. It is
celebrated in many countries each year on April 22.</P>
      <P>Cutting carbon dioxide emissions is a matter of great urgency in Taiwan, with
the country's per capita carbon dioxide emissions amounting to three times the
global average.</P>
      <P>Each Taiwan citizen produces about 12 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year,
much higher than the global average of 4 tons. Taiwan is responsible for about
one percent of the entire global greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

      <P>Fighting fatigue and a sore serving shoulder, Taiwan's Chen Ti saved his Davis
Cup team from a painful defeat Sunday in its Asia/ Oceania Zone Group I playoff
encounter against upstart Kazakhstan in Almaty.</P>
      <P>Chen' s clutch play in two tiebreakers proved the difference as he outlasted
Kazakh veterain Almaty n Alexey Kedryuk 7-6 (8), 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (4) to give
Taiwan a 3-2 comeback win in the best-of-five tie and avoid a relegation battle
against the Philippines in September.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan having to win both reverse singles Sunday to claim victory after
losing the doubles on Saturday, Taiwan's No. 1 Lu Yen-hsun launched the comeback
with a relatively routine 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 triumph over Kazakhstan's Russian import
Yuriy Schukin.</P>
      <P>Although Lu is only ranked 13 places higher than Schukin, the gulf seemed far
wider as the world no. 114 rarely was pressured on his serve and returned well
on the lightning fast court in Almaty.</P>
      <P>It was then up to Chen to clinch the final point, and for the second time in
three years, the mild-mannered 24-year-old overcame the pressure, and fatigue
from having been on the court more than seven hours the previous two days, to
pull through.</P>
      <P>Although Chen is ranked 238 places higher than Kedryuk, he needed three sets to
overcome the 27-year-old Kazakh in a Futures event in Uzbekistan last year and
was likely to have an even tougher task in front of a highly partisan crowd.</P>
      <P>Chen was playing this weekend in place of Taiwan's No. 2-ranked player Wang Yeu-
tzuoo, who was left off the team because he has yet to recover his form after
battling illness and injuries in recent months.</P>
      <P>Wang's absence almost proved costly after the 127th-ranked Schukin, listed as a
Russian on the ATP site, was added to the Kazakhstan team recently when he was
granted a passport from the Central Asia country.</P>
      <P>He outlasted Chen in a five-setter on Friday and partnered with Kedryuk on
Saturday to win the doubles and give the hosts a 2-1 lead.</P>
      <P>But fortunately for the visitors, Chen replicated his decisive victory of
February 2006 when he beat Aqeel Khan in four sets in Taipei to give Taiwan a
3-2 Group 1 opening round win against Pakistan.</P>
      <P>With the victory, Taiwan's Davis Cup campaign for the year ends, and it will
open the competition as one of the eight teams in Asia/ Oceania Zone Group 1
next year.</P>

Chinese President Hu Jintao at a regional economic forum in China has set the
tone for cross-strait relations in the next four years, an opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) lawmaker said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hu mentioned cross-strait trade exchanges twice in his short opening remarks
during the meeting with Hu, which clearly focused the 20-minute discussion on
trade, said KMT Legislator Lin Yu-fang.</P>
      <P>The meeting marked the highest-level political contact across the Taiwan Strait

      <P>Siew, who took part in the forum in his capacity as chairman of the private

      <P>Offering his views on the meeting between Hu and the KMT's Siew on the sidelines

and business leaders from Asia, the U.S., Europe and Australia.</P>
      <P>It has been widely speculated that the "1992 consensus"-- a formula that the KMT
said would allow the two sides to skirt the issue of Taiwan' s sovereignty in
any official talks -- could serve as platform for the restoration of cross-
strait dialogue after President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT starts his four-
year term May 20.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT, under the "1992 consensus," each side would agree that
there is one China, but with different definitions of that one China, with
Beijing referring to "one China" as "the People's Republic of China" and Taipei
as "the Republic of China, " Taiwan's official title.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin said, China wanted to show the foreign delegates at the
economic forum it hosted from April 11-13 that it now has a harmonious, improved
relationship with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, China's inability to handle the cross-strait issue well will prompt
other countries to doubt Beijing's ability to play a leading role in economic
integration in Asia, he added.</P>
      <P>Lin nevertheless described the Siew-Hu meeting as having more of a symbolic
significance, but added that he believes the meeting will have a major impact on
the policies of state leaders on both sides of the strait in the next four
years.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations have been frozen in the past eight years due to China's
unwillingness to hold dialogue with Taiwan's incumbent Democratic  Progressive
Party  administration,  which  favors independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP-elect's meeting with Chinese leader seen as ice-breaker: scholar</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An unprecedented meeting between Taiwan's Vice President-elect Vincent Siew and
Chinese President Hu Jintao at a Beijing-hosted economic forum reflects a
thawing of relations between Taiwan and China, according to a Taiwanese scholar.</P>
      <P>Beijing did not say much after the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , which advocates
closer ties with China, won the March 22 presidential poll, Lin Chong-Pin, a
professor of Taipei-based Tamkang University, said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hu's remarks at the 20-minute meeting with Siew Saturday on the sidelines of the
Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) in China's southern Hainan province was the first
official response from Beijing since the Taiwan election, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Although he did not go into any details regarding trade exchanges and
cooperation between China and Taiwan, Hu responded positively to Siew's four
requests to resume cross-strait dialogue, normalize bilateral trade and economic
ties, launch weekend cross-strait charter flights and open Chinese tourists to
Taiwan, Lin claimed.</P>
      <P>It is now left to be seen how the two sides will work out the details, said Lin,
a former vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council and a former vice defence
minister.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that the meeting also marked another new development, as Beijing
did not insist on asking Taiwan to accept its "one-China" policy, but rather Hu
put aside political issues and focused on economic matters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, neither side mentioned the "1992 consensus" -- a formula that the KMT
said would allow the two sides to skirt the issue of Taiwan' s sovereignty in
any official talks -- after the meeting, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>The decision by both sides to set aside political issues "is sort of in line
with the spirit of the 1992 consensus," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Siew, who attended the forum in his capacity as chairman of the private Taipei-
based Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation (CSCMF) , is the first Taiwanese
vice president-elect ever to set foot on Chinese soil.</P>
      <P>The meeting marked the highest-level political contact across the Taiwan Strait
in nearly six decades.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Demand of large-size LCD panel will meet the supply in Q2 : analysis</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a 17 percent oversupply of large-size LCD panels in the first quarter of
2008, the balance is expected to level out starting in the second quarter if the
demand remains largely the same, IDC Taiwan stated in a recent press release.</P>
      <P>IDC Taiwan is the Taiwan branch of IDC, which provides data, market
intelligence,  advisory services,  and tracks trends in information technology,
telecommunications, and consumer technology markets globally.</P>
      <P>Despite the falling demand in the first quarter for LCD panels, 14-inch and
bigger, the prices of such products did not record a significant decline, the
IDC stated.</P>
      <P>The prices of personal computer monitors and notebook panels dropped 3 percent
to 10 percent, while LCD-TV panels were 4 percent cheaper thanks to strong
demand, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>"What stabilized the prices was mainly the LCD panel makers move to
strategically increase inventory instead of selling the panels on the market,"
said Hsu Mei-wen, IDC Taiwan's panel research manager.</P>
      <P>This strategy will help panel makers to deal with a crisis such as the one of
last year when demand outstripped supply, due to the snow crisis in China said
Hsu.</P>
      <P>Expecting a growth in LCD-TV panel demand that could compensate for the weak
demand for desktop computers, the IDC forecasted that starting in the second
quarter, the demand for LCD panels will begin to top supply, sending prices up.</P>
      <P>"In the third quarter prices will reach a peak, " the press release stated.</P>
      <P>The IDC said the world's leading LCD manufacturers, including Taiwan's Chi Mei
and AU Optronics, are expanding their production capacity, which will increase
total supply 25 percent to 30 percent year-on-year. However, the IDC noted that
the increase might not be enough to cope with the soaring demand.</P>
      <P>The LCD makers are evaluating to what extent demand could rise in the latter
half of 2008, as the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis is still affecting the global
market, said the IDC, adding that the makers would likely decide on the level of
production expansion in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>Citing the recent decline of the U.S. currency against the New Taiwan dollar,
the IDC advised LCD makers to take appropriate hedge positions to avoid
potential losses as result of a higher Taiwan dollar.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party no longer has a monopoly on the Taiwan
identity issue, and if the party continues to focus solely on that concern, it
would be hard pressed to regain majority support in Taiwan, DPP Chairman Frank
Hsieh has said.</P>
      <P>In an article published Saturday in the Chinese-language China Times, Hsieh
wrote that the Taiwan identity advocated by the DPP has become a consensus in
Taiwan's society and has also been accepted by the newly elected Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he believed that the party could soon stage a comeback if its members
at all levels engaged in a self-reflection and reform.</P>
      <P>In the article titled, "My Reflections and Future Prospects,", Hsieh took the
self-examination lead by stating four areas in which he thought he could have
done better.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he had served in a number of important posts during the eight
years of the DPP administration but had failed to fulfill the desire of Taiwan's
people for a more harmonious society.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairman also offered an apology for disappointing the Taiwan people
because he was unable to spur the party to deliver on its promises of integrity
and procedural justice.</P>
      <P>Since the DPP came to power in 2000, it has become increasingly alienated from
the grassroots communities and has been motivated largely by a desire to remain
in office, Hsieh said. He said the party sometimes sacrificed the values of
progress and democracy to maintain political power, and he pegged the reasons
for its recent crushing election defeats firmly to those problems.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also apologized to party members and supporters for having failed to help
deter factional fighting within the party while he DPP chairman and a member of
the DPP Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which will go into opposition when the KMT takes office May 20, should
monitor the incoming KMT government, particularly on its handling of cross-
Taiwan Strait issues, and will not allow the KMT to compromise Taiwan's
sovereignty or national security, or to hurt the democratic movement, Hsieh
wrote.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, urging the public not to speculate on his reasons, reiterated that he
will not run for president in 2012 and will not endorse anyone to run in the
presidential election at that time.</P>
      <P>Also on Saturday at a reception, The DPP chairman floated the idea of running a
"shadow government" to monitor the incoming KMT government, which he said would
be based on the DPP's basic values and concept of a "wellbeing economy."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he would use the administrative experience he gained as the country's
premier and as mayor of Kaohsiung to help young people develop skills in
supervising the government.</P>
      <P>At the reception, which he attended by taking the MRT, Hsieh said that he had
nothing to complain about and respected the voters' choice, in response to a
question on why he had lost by a margin of more than 20,000 votes in the
southern port city where he had served as mayor.</P>

      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew returned to Taipei late Sunday from a three-day
forum in Hainan province, southern China.</P>
      <P>On his arrival at the Taoyuan International Airport, Siew waved to waiting
jounalists but didn't answer their questions.</P>
      <P>Before leaving Boao,  Hainan province,  Siew described his attendance  at the
2008 Boao  Forum  for Asia as a successful "ice-breaking" trip that not only
helped to ease tensions across the Taiwan Strait, but also served to enhance
Taiwan's international image.</P>
      <P>Siew told Taiwan journalists accompanied him on the trip that he hoped his
20-minute meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the forum
will lead to a better understanding between Taipei and Beijing and contribute to
the trust-building process across the strait.</P>
      <P>The Hu-Siew meeting, the highest political contact between Taipei and Beijing
during the last six decades, was the highlight of Siew's activities in Boao and
was considered a breakthrough in the political impasse between China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which considers Taiwan part of its territory had ceased all contact
with Taiwan since 1999 when then-Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui described the
relations between his country and China as "special state to state, " had
hardened its no-contact stance after the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party came to power in Taiwan in 2000.</P>
      <P>During his talks with Hu, Siew called for the launch of weekend charter flights
between Taiwan and the mainland, and urged China to allow its people to visit
Taiwan for sightseeing purposes.</P>
      <P>Stopping short of agreeing with Siew's requests immediately, Hu said Beijing
will keep negotiating with Taipei on these issues.</P>
      <P>Siew, who will be inaugurated on May 20, took part in the forum in his private
capacity as chairman of the Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation  which he
founded  in 2001 to promote  the establishment of a common market between Taiwan
and China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Vice President-elect Vincent Siew said Sunday that while striving to
bolster its economic growth, Taiwan will pay attention  to social justice  and
sustainable development.</P>
      <P>To achieve that goal, Siew said, Taiwan should seek to increase domestic demand
and consumption, as well as to expand public investment, which will eventually
lead to infrastructure upgrades.</P>
      <P>Governmental policies that would contribute to rejuvenating Taiwan's industrial
structure so as to rev up innovation in the private sector are also imperative,
added Siew, who is slated to take office on May 20..</P>

      <P>Residents of southern Taiwan joined nearly 1,000 Thai workers in that part of
the country Sunday to celebrate the Songkran Festival, which is regarded in
Thailand as the traditional New Year.</P>
      <P>The Thai nationals are employed in Kaohsiung City and the counties of Kaohsiung
and Pingtung. The Kaohsiung County Government used several fire-trucks and
water-carrying vehicles to provide logistic support at what is also known as the
"Thai water festival."</P>
      <P>The festival formally began at the plaza in front of the Kaohsiung County Labor
Recreation Center with a representative of the Thai workers pouring flower-
scented water into the hands of the guests of honor seated on a platform.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Deputy Magistrate Yeh Nan-ming, Pingtung County Deputy
Magistrate Chung Chia-bin,  and Damrongsak Engsriswasdi, director of the
Thailand Trade and Economic Office in Taiwan, each threw a bucket of water into
the crowd, marking the beginning of a hilarious water fight symbolizing mutual
well-wishing.</P>
      <P>The Songkran Festival, by far the most important event of the year for the Thai
people, will last until 15. It is a time of fun and a special time to pay
tribute to water, the most important element in the agricultural culture of
Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the first choice of Thai nationals seeking employment abroad. It has

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fighting fatigue and a sore serving shoulder, Taiwan's Chen Ti saved his Davis
Cup team from a painful defeat Sunday in its Asia/ Oceania Zone Group I playoff
encounter against upstart Kazakhstan in Almaty.</P>
      <P>Chen' s clutch play in two tiebreakers proved the difference as he outlasted
Kazakh veterain Almaty n Alexey Kedryuk 7-6 (8), 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (4) to give
Taiwan a 3-2 comeback win in the best-of-five tie and avoid a relegation battle
against the Philippines in September.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan having to win both reverse singles Sunday to claim victory after
losing the doubles on Saturday, Taiwan's No. 1 Lu Yen-hsun launched the comeback
with a relatively routine 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 triumph over Kazakhstan's Russian import
Yuriy Schukin.</P>
      <P>Although Lu is only ranked 13 places higher than Schukin, the gulf seemed far
wider as the world no. 114 rarely was pressured on his serve and returned well
on the lightning fast court in Almaty.</P>
      <P>It was then up to Chen to clinch the final point, and for the second time in
three years, the mild-mannered 24-year-old overcame the pressure, and fatigue
from having been on the court more than seven hours the previous two days, to
pull through.</P>
      <P>Although Chen is ranked 238 places higher than Kedryuk, he needed three sets to
overcome the 27-year-old Kazakh in a Futures event in Uzbekistan last year and
was likely to have an even tougher task in front of a highly partisan crowd.</P>
      <P>Chen was playing this weekend in place of Taiwan's No. 2-ranked player Wang Yeu-
tzuoo, who was left off the team because he has yet to recover his form after
battling illness and injuries in recent months.</P>
      <P>Wang's absence almost proved costly after the 127th-ranked Schukin, listed as a
Russian on the ATP site, was added to the Kazakhstan team recently when he was
granted a passport from the Central Asia country.</P>
      <P>He outlasted Chen in a five-setter on Friday and partnered with Kedryuk on
Saturday to win the doubles and give the hosts a 2-1 lead.</P>
      <P>But fortunately for the visitors, Chen replicated his decisive victory of
February 2006 when he beat Aqeel Khan in four sets in Taipei to give Taiwan a
3-2 Group 1 opening round win against Pakistan.</P>
      <P>With the victory, Taiwan's Davis Cup campaign for the year ends, and it will
open the competition as one of the eight teams in Asia/ Oceania Zone Group 1
next year.</P>

      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou and Vice President-elect Vincent Siew of the main
opposition Kuomintang are slated to meet the press Monday afternoon, mainly to
discuss Siew's recent attendance at the 2008 Boao Forum for Asia which took
place in Hainan, China April 11-13.</P>
      <P>Siew, who attended the annual Boao forum in his capacity as chairman of the
private Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation, is expected to be showered with
questions about China's unilateral adding of the "one China" term to a news
release that was issued after Siew and Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming
jointly presided over a roundtable meeting Sunday on the sidelines of the forum.</P>
      <P>On that issue, Siew said after the forum that he and his team members had no
idea about it and that the news release, issued by the Chinese Ministry of
Commerce, had not been approved by the Taiwan delegation before it was released.</P>
      <P>China released a statement Saturday that read in part, "Both sides will build up
a bilateral communication platform, the sooner the better, under the "one-China"
policy." The statement was posted on the official Web site of the Chinese
Ministry of Commerce.</P>
      <P>It was learned Monday that the words "one China" have since been deleted from
the statement.</P>
      <P>Siew and the Taiwan delegation returned to Taiwan late Sunday night. Before
leaving Boao, Hainan province, Siew described his attendance  at the 2008 Boao
Forum for Asia as a successful "ice-breaking" trip that not only helped to ease
tensions across the Taiwan Strait, but also served as a platform for economic
exchanges between Taiwan and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Siew told Taiwan journalists accompanying him on the trip that he hoped his
20-minute meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the forum
will lead to a better understanding between Taipei and Beijing and contribute to
the trust-building process across the strait.</P>
      <P>The Hu-Siew meeting, the highest political contact between Taipei and Beijing
during the last six decades, was the highlight of Siew's activities in Boao and
was considered a breakthrough in the political impasse between China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During his talks with Hu, Siew called for the launch of weekend charter flights
between Taiwan and the mainland and urged China to allow its people to visit
Taiwan for sightseeing purposes.</P>
      <P>Stopping short of agreeing with Siew's requests immediately, Hu said Beijing
will keep negotiating with Taipei on these issues.</P>
      <P>Ma and Siew are scheduled to take office May 20.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is forecast to win seven gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games slated to
open in Beijing Aug. 8, the country's top official in charge of sports affairs
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yang Jong-her, chairman of the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council, said 37
male and 24 female Taiwan athletes have qualified to compete in nine events at
the Beijing Olympics and these athletes are expected to win seven gold and many
other medals at the games.</P>
      <P>Taiwan athletes are seen as having the best chances of winning gold  in the
taekwondo,  weightlifting,  archery  and  tennis competitions, Yang said during
a session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan athletes have registered to compete in other events, including women's
softball, table tennis, track and field, swimming and baseball, according to
Yang.</P>
      <P>At the session, ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Kuan Pi-ling
suggested that the Sports Affairs Council emulate the United States and plan to
boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics to express Taiwan's
indignation over China's military crackdown on Tibetan protesters.</P>
      <P>Responding to Kuan's suggestion, Yang said that his council has "resolved to
adhere to the principle of separating politics from sports."</P>
      <P>Yang added that the Sports Affairs Council will consult other Cabinet-level
agencies on issues pertaining to Taiwan's participation in international
competitions  and the country's  hosting  of international sporting events, such
as the World Games set to take place in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan next
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  athletes  won two gold medals,  both in taekwondo competitions, as well
as two silvers and one bronze at the last Olympic Games held in Athens in 2004,
taking 31st spot in the overall medal standings that year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan established the SEF in 1991 to serve as an intermediary body to handle
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official links. Its Chinese counterpart

    <TEXT>
      <P>Labor rights activists groups urged the government Monday to honor its promise
to review the minimum wage annually and take steps to have all wage earners
covered by the Labor Standards Act.</P>
      <P>Members of several social activist groups, including the Taiwan Confederation of
Trade Unions (TCTU) , filed an appeal with the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) Monday for a national meeting to review the existing minimum wage
structure, a meeting that the CLA had earlier promised.</P>
      <P>TCTU Chairman Shih Chao-hsien called for the CLA to convene the meeting as soon
as possible to decide whether or not the minimum wage is at a reasonable level,
as prices of commodities and daily necessities have soared over the past year.</P>
      <P>Shih said that although inflation has surged by an average of 6.46 percent over
the past four years and the country's economy has advanced between 4 percent-6
percent annually, blue-collar workers have not enjoyed any positive results of
this growths.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan's minimum wage has not been adjusted over the last 10
years except for once in 2007.</P>
      <P>"Even though the minimum wage was adjusted last year, the payment adjustment did
not efficiently reflect the real growth in inflation," Shih said.</P>
      <P>He further noted that the country's civil servants enjoyed salary hikes in 1999,
2000, 2001 and 2005.</P>
      <P>"I hope President-elect Ma Ying-jeou and his new administration will pay closer
attention to the issue of salaries for the working class," Shih added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sun You-lien, secretary-general of the Taiwan Labor Front, said that
according to official statistics released by the CLA, about 310,000 blue-collar
workers have yet to be protected under the Labor Standards Act.</P>
      <P>However, he disputed this figure, saying that according to his group's
estimation, at least around 600,000 salaried workers are not entitled to the
benefits of the Labor Standards Act.</P>
      <P>Sun called for the CLA to make a commitment that measures will be taken to
gradually allow all these disadvantaged workers to enjoy the benefits stipulated
in the law.</P>
      <P>The minimum wage was raised to NT$17,280 (US$568) per month and the minimum
hourly wage was hiked to NT$95 July 1, 2007. About 1.41 million "marginal"
members of the country's workforce -- including foreign laborers, part-time
workers,  senior citizens who have returned to the employment market after
retirement and female workers -- reportedly benefited from the wage hike.</P>
      <P>In response to the groups' calls, CLA officials said Monday that a review of the
issue of including more employees under the protection of the Labor Standards
Act is expected to be completed by the end of 2009 and that a national meeting
on the minimum wage issue will be held as scheduled -- probably after May 20,
when the new Kuomintang administration will take office.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture's (COA's) Agricultural Research Institute recently
identified a previously unrecorded type of cherry tree with white blossoms,
found at high elevations in Taiwan, as a subgroup of the Taiwan Cherry tree.</P>
      <P>The institute has since registered the "white blossomed Taiwan cherry" with the
International Union of Biologicial Science's Commission for the Nomenclature of
Cultivated Plants under the name "prunus campanulata Maxim F. Alba I.C. Wen."</P>
      <P>Huang Sheng-chung, director of the institute's National Plant Genetic Resources
Center, said Monday that he recently decided to research the background of the
special white-blossomed cherry tree and discovered that there was no record in
Taiwan of this type of tree.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he initially suspected that the tree might have been an imported
Japanese variety. However, after doing a thorough search, he found that the tree
did not match any on record in Japan's plant databases.</P>
      <P>He therefore decided to carry out a Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA analysis on
a specimen of the tree and determined it to be a member of the Taiwan Cherry
tree family.</P>
      <P>The white-blossomed variety of cherry tree shares most of the same
characteristics as the Taiwan Cherry, or prunus campanulata Maxim, including
excellent soil adaptability.</P>
      <P>The main difference is the color of the blossoms, with the Taiwan Cherry having
deep, rosy-pink, bell-shaped flowers about an inch wide.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Cherry is native to southern China, Taiwan and Japan's Ryukyu
Islands, and is usually found at elevations of between 500 meters and 2,000
meters.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Cherry has been hybridized with other cherry species to produce
several important ornamental trees, including the highly treasured "Okame."</P>
      <P>Throughout Taiwan's sightseeing areas, there are some 100,000 Taiwan Cherry
trees that each year attract thousands of tourists who flock to see the
spectacular display of color when the trees are in bloom.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the presence of the white-blossomed variety of cherry tree adds
another element to Taiwan's natural scenery during the spring months and
provides an additional reason for nature lovers to visit.</P>

      <P>A total of 779,000 passengers used the "mini three links" across the Taiwan
Strait during 2007, according to tallies released Monday by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The figure marks an increase of 16.4 percent over the level for the previous
year, according to the tallies.</P>
      <P>Of the total, 672,000 were Taiwanese nationals, marking an increase of 14.8
percent over the year-earlier figure.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 107,000 Chinese citizens used the "mini three links" routes in 2007,
up 27.8 percent.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Chinese passenger numbers had broken the 100,000-mark
since the implementation of the links at the start of 2001, the MOTC said.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" refers to direct postal, transport and trade links
between the Chinese cities of Xiamen, Mawei and Quanzhou in Fujian Province and
Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>As of the end of 2007, 2.681 million passengers had used the routes, with an
average annual increase of 75 percent, according to the MOTC statistics.</P>
      <P>Of that total, 263,000 of the passengers were Chinese citizens, with the average
annual increase standing at about 93 percent, the tallies show.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the figures, MOTC officials noted the large difference between
Taiwanese passenger and Chinese passenger numbers, resulting in part from the
differences in policies between the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that passengers using these routes are mainly Taiwanese, the
officials said that the mini three links have not contributed much to boosting
bilateral cross-strait exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Siew's trip to BFA `total failure': Taiwan Thinktank</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   14  (CNA)
04/14/08  17:59:39

    <TEXT>
      <P>As opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT) President-elect Ma Ying-jeou and Vice
President-elect Vincent Siew celebrated the fruits of Siew's appearance at the
Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) over the weekend,  speakers at a forum organized by a
pro-independence think tank Monday described his trip as a "total failure."</P>
      <P>Participants in the Taiwan Thinktank forum also claimed that instead of
achieving substantive results, Siew's visit served only to divert international
attention  from the Chinese  authorities' crackdown on Tibet and caused
confusion over Taiwan's cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>Saturday's meeting between Chinese President Hu Jintao and Siew on the sidelines
of the three-day BFA in China's Hainan Province was the highest-level contact
ever between the two sides since Taiwan and China split in 1949 after a civil
war, and is being viewed as the first step of a thaw in long-frozen political
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations have been stalled over the past eight years, with
outgoing President Chen Shui-bian -- who has been branded a separatist by China
-- restricting closer Taiwan ties with China.</P>
      <P>However, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and pro- independence
groups blasted Siew's visit, describing it as impetuous conduct that belittles
Taiwan's sovereignty, as Siew applied for a "re-entry permit for Taiwan
compatriots " from China -- though without actually using it -- for the trip.</P>
      <P>"From every aspect, the Hu-Siew meeting was no doubt a total failure, " said Lai
Yi-chung, deputy director of the DPP's Department of International Affairs, at
the seminar organized by the think tank to discuss and evaluate Siew's trip.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Hu-Siew meeting was more of a formality rather than anything of
substance, Lai said the facts that Hu did not respond to four requests Siew
proposed and that no further meetings were arranged all indicate that the gambit
was a failure.</P>
      <P>In his meeting with Hu, Siew said Taiwan's position is that the two sides should
"face reality, envision the future, put aside differences and pursue a win-win
situation."</P>
      <P>Responding to Siew's proposals, Hu said China will continue promoting bilateral
economic and cultural exchanges, negotiating on the opening of weekend cross-
strait charter flights and on issues regarding Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan,
caring for the rights and welfare of the Taiwanese people, and seeking a
resumption of cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, Hu only touched on the substantive issues lightly.</P>
      <P>"Hu only said `continue promoting' rather than making it clear if and when talks
will be resumed, " he said. "As to the normalization of cross-strait economic
and trade exchanges, Hu did not mention this at all," he noted.</P>
      <P>Lai said that despite everyone focusing on Siew's landmark meeting with Hu and
interpreting of it as "breaking the ice, " the real indicators will be whether
China will ease its suppression of Taiwan at the upcoming May 19 World Health
Assembly, or whether China will really reduce the number missiles aimed at
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai Horng-ming, deputy general-secretary of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries, also said that another indicator would be whether Taiwan can send a
higher-ranking official to attend this year's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) summit meeting, or whether China and Taiwan -- both of which are members
of the World Trade Organization  --  can have better interaction under the
organization's framework.</P>
      <P>As to DPP accusations that Siew "fell into China's trap by attending the BFA" --
a meeting he has attended every year since 2003 -- and that China made use of
his visit to deflect criticism over its crackdown in Tibet, Lai claimed that the
Kuomintang (KMT), which will take office May 20, "falls for China's plots every
time."</P>
      <P>He also said former KMT Chairman Lien Chan's visit to China in 2005 helped China
to divert attention  from the international community, which was criticizing it
for passing its anti-session law targeting Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang declined Monday to comment on the
possible impact on Taiwan's diplomatic situation that could be the result of the
historic meeting between Vice President-elect Vincent Siew and Chinese President
Hu Jintao over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Huang said he could not tell whether the meeting, which took place on the
sidelines of the 2008 Boao Forum for Asia in China's Hainan Province, "will
affect or have anything to do with Taiwan's diplomatic situation."</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks while answering reporters' questions in the southern
city of Tainan on whether  the Siew-Hu meeting represented a diplomatic
breakthrough for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that diplomacy is a symbol of national sovereignty, Huang said he
believes that the incoming Kuomintang administration will handle cross-Taiwan
Strait issues cautiously as President-elect Ma Ying-jeou has reaffirmed that he
will attach great importance to Taiwan's diplomatic ties with other countries.</P>
      <P>Speaking of Taiwan's renewed bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO)
under the name Taiwan, the minister of the outgoing government led by the
Democratic Progressive Party said that Beijing has made public its decision to
boycott any Taiwanese proposal for WHO access.</P>
      <P>Huang said that "designation is not the key problem, rather it is China's
attitude" toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"China fears that any concession to allow Taiwan to join (the WHO) will trigger
a domino effect" on Taiwan's other attempts to obtain membership of
international organizations, he said, adding that China will still try to shut
out Taiwan even if it uses other names for the bid.</P>
      <P>Asked about China's use of the "one-China" term in a public statement released
after the Siew-Hu meeting that was regarded as an "ice-melting" moment in the
long-frozen cross-strait direct talks, before deleting it after Taiwan
protested, Huang said he has never seen China's "one China" stance waver.</P>
      <P>Beijing has never altered its stance of claiming that "there is only one China
in the world, and that Taiwan is part of China, whose only legal government is
the People's Republic of China," he said.</P>
      <P>The "one China" principle is like "a magic spell that China has cast on Taiwan,
" which binds Taiwan whenever it tries to join international activities, he
added.</P>

      <P>High anticipation of better economic ties between China and Taiwan has allowed
Taiwan's share prices to remain unshaken by last Friday's huge setback in the
U.S. stock market, with the local bourse only dropping 16.90 points, or 0.18
percent, even as other Asian stock markets suffered a blow from the 256-point
drop in the U.S. market.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang's (KMT) win in the March 22 presidential election has given local
investors and industries  the expectation  of prosperous economic relation
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The anticipation was further enhanced by the recent Boao Forum for Asia, in
which Vice President-elect Vincent Siew and Chinese President Hu Jintao held a
landmark meeting over the weekend discussing issues including direct chartered
flights on weekends and bilateral investment in real estate and banks.</P>
      <P>Compared with other major Asian stock markets such as Japan and Hong Kong, which
dropped Monday by 3.10 percent and 3.47 percent, respectively, analysts said the
fruitful results of the Boao Forum have made Taiwan stocks immune from outside
influence, especially in such sectors as tourism, shipping and aviation,
construction, and finance. All of them rose by 5.38 percent, 1.46 percent, 4.07
percent, and 0.51 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Analysts attributed the potential boost in domestic consumers' confidence as the
main factor strengthening those sectors.</P>
      <P>With a more prosperous economic exchange between Taiwan and China, the domestic
demands are likely to rise, said Andy Chang, senior vice-president of Cathay
Securities Investment Trust Co.</P>
      <P>Chang said the revival of business activities could lift the confidence of both
consumers and investors, predicting that the promising outlook of cross-strait
trades could attract customers as well as lure back the countrys outflow of
capital, which is estimated to be NT$6.7 trillion over the last eight years.
The return of the foreign-based Taiwanese, along with Chinese tourists and
investors, could spur local industry sectors including airlines, real estate and
construction, and retail commodities, he said, referring to the one million
China-based Taiwanese businessmen.</P>
      <P>Taiwan stocksprice-earning ratio, a measure of how a company s earnings relate
to its stock price, could also be gaining ground due to the increase in
investorsconfidence,Chang added.</P>

      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou received the rare honor Monday of having nine trees
planted in Jerusalem's Forest of Peace in his name, representing the hope of
peace and prosperity in Taiwan under Ma's presidency.</P>
      <P>In a private meeting, Israeli Representative to Taiwan Raphael Gamzou, on behalf
of the Forest of Peace, presented the certificate of tree-planting to Ma at the
headquarters of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>"Since both of us (Israel and Taiwan) are pursuing peace, I decided to plant
nine trees on Ma's behalf," Gamzou told the CNA.</P>
      <P>Explaining that the number nine is synonymous with the Chinese word "jeou" and
symbolizes "a new beginning" in Hebrew, Gamzou said the tree-planting project is
"to wish him success and regional peace and prosperity."</P>
      <P>In August 2007, Gamzou also planted 18 trees in honor of Master Chen Yen,
founder of the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation.</P>
      <P>On behalf of his wife Michal Gamzou, Gamzou also presented Ma's wife Chou Mei-
ching with a CD of Israeli vocalist David D'Or, who creates works based on the
teachings of Master Chen Yen.</P>
      <P>Gamzou congratulated Ma for his landslide victory in the March 22 presidential
election  and  commended  the Taiwanese  people's achievements in establishing
democracy.</P>
      <P>Recalling a visit he made to Israel in 1999 as Taipei mayor, Ma said he was
really impressed by the country, the Weitzman Institute of Science -- Israel's
top research organization -- and his meeting with then-Jerusalem Mayor Ehud
Olmert, who is now Israel's Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>Ma, an enthusiastic jogger, also recalled jogging on the long beach at Tel Aviv,
saying that the experience "was great fun."</P>
      <P>Although issues on Taiwan's domestic politics were only slightly touched upon
during the meeting, Ma, however, restated his wish to Gamzou that he hopes
direct chartered flights between Taiwan and China will start very soon and that
increasing tourism from China will help boost Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Characterizing his meeting with Ma as "fruitful, " Gamzou said he and Ma share a
common wish for peace in the Middle East and across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We both wish that Taiwanese and Israelis can work together in various fields
for the benefit and prosperity of both," Gamzou said.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Trong Chai registered
Monday to run for the chairmanship of the party in an election slated for May
18.</P>
      <P>The stalwart pro-Taiwan independence lawmaker was the first potential candidate
to register with the DPP Central Committee to run for the post, which will be
vacated by Frank Hsieh next month.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who was the DPP's standard bearer in the March 22 presidential election,
offered to resign as DPP chairman March 26 to take responsibility for the
party's crushing defeat in the poll.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, nevertheless, agreed to stay on in the chairmanship post until a new
leader is chosen.</P>
      <P>According to DPP election guidelines, consultations will be held among
candidates for the position after the registration process, and if a leader is
not selected, then an election will be held.</P>
      <P>The DPP will invite hopefuls to register April 14-18 and will organize a
platform presentation for the candidates May 10. After the registration, the
party will try to reach a consensus on one candidate  through consultations
and,  if that fails,  then a chairmanship election will be held May 18.</P>
      <P>Upon his registration as a candidate, Chai said that he supports "collective
leadership, " and suggested that several DPP members of the younger generation
be appointed to serve as the party's vice chairmen so that they could have an
opportunity to be groomed for leadership.</P>
      <P>"In this way, the party would be able to achieve generational change," he said.</P>
      <P>Apparently not daunted by the voices of younger party members, who have said
that the new DPP chairman should be "young and inclined towards reform," Chai
said he is "resolute in his decision to run for the chairmanship" because he is
"determined to safeguard the Taiwan-centric political line and continue the
efforts to seek Taiwan independence -- ideals that are not necessarily central
to the views of the younger generation of DPP members."</P>
      <P>Chai, however, said that he would not oppose the proposal that the party should
try to reach a consensus on one candidate through consultations.</P>
      <P>"I see it as my duty to serve the DPP as the party is facing unprecedented
challenges -- challenges that are even tougher than those 20 years ago when the
DPP was founded as a small opposition party -- and in the wake of two
humiliating election defeats this year," Chai asserted.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that 200,000 DPP members engage in community service as
volunteers, so that they can "touch the hearts of the public," like members of
the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, the largest charity
organization in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh took the helm of the DPP Jan. 16 this year, replacing President Chen
Shui-bian, who resigned from the party chairmanship soon after the DPP was
soundly defeated in the Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Chen was widely blamed for the party's  drubbing  in the legislative polls which
left the DPP with only 27 seats in the new 113-seat legislature.</P>

      <P>A senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official turned a cold shoulder to
Vice President-elect Vincent Siew's trip to an economic forum in China,
criticizing at a seminar Monday in Taipei that it has created an illusion that
will severely hinder Taiwan's diplomatic efforts and strategies.</P>
      <P>"The incoming administration, which prioritized cross-straits policies over
diplomatic policies, or thought of using cross-straits policies as the
guidelines for all diplomatic policies, will severely impact Taiwan's overall
diplomatic strategy, " said Liu Shih-chung, vice chairman of the MOFA's Research
and Planning Committee.</P>
      <P>Saturday's meeting of Chinese President Hu Jintao and Siew on the sidelines of
the three-day economic conference Boao Forum for Asia in China's Hainan Province
was the highest-level contact ever between the two sides since Taiwan and China
split in 1949 after a civil war, and is being viewed as the first step of
thawing the long- stalled political exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations between Taiwan and China have been stalled over the past
eight years, with Beijing reluctant to deal with the outgoing administration of
President Chen Shui- bian -- who has been branded a separatist by China.</P>
      <P>Describing the incoming government as "over enthusiastic with overly high
expectations, " Liu said "it fell right into China's carrot-and- stick trap --
feeding with more economic and trade exchanges without giving up diplomatic
suppression of Taiwan's participation in the international community."</P>
      <P>In addition, the trip could also bring trouble to future diplomatic efforts, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>"When we ask our diplomatic  allies  to speak for us in international
organizations or urge them not to make contact with China, they might question:
your vice president-elect also shook hands with President Hu Jintao," Liu said.</P>
      <P>It will be an important and difficult task for President-elect Ma Ying-jeou to
find an equilibrium between the cross-strait policies and diplomatic policies,
he added.</P>
      <P>"The so-called ice-melting trip is, in reality, just the tip of an iceberg,

      <P>State-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) President Edward K.M. Chen said Monday
that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will be responsible for any losses
in the firm's investment in a power plant in Honduras.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to questions from several opposition
Kuomintang  (KMT)  lawmakers  during  a legislative interpellation session.</P>
      <P>During the session, the legislators asked Chen why Taipower is still insisting
on investing in a hydroelectric power plant in Honduras, one of Taiwan
diplomatic allies in Central America, after MOFA classified the politics and
social order in that country as unstable and after Taipower has incurred massive
losses due to a government ban on lifting a freeze on electricity prices.</P>
      <P>According to Taipower statistics, the firm is expected to have an income of
NT$443.8 billion (US$14.64 billion) and spending of NT$488.6 billion this year,
which will leave a pre-tax loss of NT$44.8 billion.</P>
      <P>Taipower  officials  have attributed  the losses mainly to continuing soaring
fuel prices and increasing demand for electricity.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers asked why Taipower is still evaluating a project that would help
the Honduran government build a power plant, at projected losses of more than
US$35 million.</P>
      <P>The power plant project forms part of a package of foreign aid that President
Chen Shui-bian promised to several Central American countries during a trip he
made there last August.</P>
      <P>"As this project is a response to government policy, the government has promised
that MOFA will be responsible for any losses the project incurs, " K.M. Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that the company might face a loss of up to NT$130 billion a
year if the government decides not to increase electricity prices to cope with
continually increasing oil prices.</P>
      <P>"If Taipower hopes to balance its books, it should increase electricity prices
by 50 percent, " the Taipower head said, adding that he favors an upward
readjustment in several stages, with 30 percent increases in the first stage.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Monday that she will hold President-elect Ma Ying-
jeou to his campaign promise to spur development in the southern Taiwan port
city, in part by asking to channel Chinese tourists there.</P>
      <P>Ma has pledged that an agreement would be reached to allow Chinese tourists to
visit Taiwan beginning in July, and Chen said that from the standpoint of
Kaohsiung, she hoped her city would be the point of entry and departure for the
visitors to boost local tourism revenues.</P>
      <P>"If that is not possible, we hope that they could at least enter Taiwan through
Taipei and leave from Kaohsiung," she said.</P>
      <P>The mayor also said that she hoped to institutionalize the distribution of tax
revenues allocated by the central government.</P>
      <P>The central government allocated NT$11.9 billion (US$391.44 million) to
Kaohsiung last year in addition to a special subsidy of NT$10 billion, Chen
said, but she worried that if funding guidelines were not institutionalized, her
city would face a funding shortfall on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>She urged the central government to enact a law on allocations to local
governments as soon as possible to ensure the city's financial future.</P>
      <P>Chen wasn't the only Democratic Progressive Party administrative head Monday who
felt closer economic ties with China would help her constituents.</P>
      <P>With frosty cross-Taiwan Strait relations perhaps thawing after a meeting
between Vice President-elect  Vincent Siew and Chinese President Hu Jintao at an
economic forum in China over the weekend, Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen
is reportedly eyeing a share of the vast Chinese market for farmers from her
county.</P>
      <P>The United Evening News said that Su will lead representatives from 24 farmers'
groups to Macau this week on a four-day visit, during which she will promote the
county's agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>She is expected to sign a long-term marketing agreement with a supermarket chain
there to supply it with premium vegetables, fruits and flowers as well as
county's specialities such as its rice, soy sauce, coffee and black peanuts.</P>
      <P>Hoping to use Macau as a springboard to tap the Chinese market. Su will visit
Beijing in mid-July on another promotional mission.</P>
      <P>Reports quoted Su as saying, "I will go anywhere that will be helpful to
farmers."</P>
      <P>Both Chen and Su are from the Democratic Progressive Party that lost power in
the March 22 presidential election. Kaohsiung City and Yunlin County are among

    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou indicated Monday that he has no plans at present to
visit China or Hong Kong, saying "it's too early" to talk about the matter.</P>
      <P>Ma was speaking at a news conference held jointly with Vice President-elect
Vincent Siew on Siew's just-concluded trip to Hainan province in southern China
to attend the Boao Forum for Asia.</P>
      <P>Siew met with Chinese President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the forum
Saturday, a meeting that Ma described as "successful" and took place in a
"natural, friendly and constructive atmosphere."</P>
      <P>But the visit wasn't one that Ma was looking to copy in the near future.</P>
      <P>The president-elect has been more interested in trying to visit the United
States, Japan and other countries before taking office May 20, a desire he made
public soon after being elected on March 22.</P>
      <P>Ma explained that he wanted to deliver a message of friendship to the countries
and brief them on his cross-Taiwan  Strait and diplomatic policies but seemed
resigned Monday that his hopes would not be fulfilled.</P>
      <P>"It doesn't matter if I can't go, " Ma said, adding that the ball was now in the
"court of others." He reiterated Taiwan's sincerity in improving international
and cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Facing local and foreign reporters' questions over when Taiwan and China will
resume long-stalled direct talks, Ma said efforts to promote the resumption of
contacts between Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and
its Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits -- will begin soon after May 20.</P>
      <P>He said a number of problems, including personnel changes and talks on technical
issues, needed to be addressed before the long-anticipated resumption of direct
talks between the two bodies, which were founded in the early 1990s to handle
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges in the absence of official links.</P>

      <P>A task force of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has worked out measures to allow
some convertibility between the Chinese yuan and the Taiwan dollar in Taiwan
proper beginning in July, a KMT lawmaker said Monday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lu Shiow-yen, co-convener of the Legislative Yuan's Finance
Committee, told reporters after a committee meeting that the legislature only
needs to make minor amendments to an existing law to allow individuals to
exchange yuan and Taiwan dollars at any designated bank.</P>
      <P>Lu is a member of the KMT task force in charge of preparations for policy
implementation after president-elect Ma Ying-jeou assumes his office as chief of
state on May 20.</P>
      <P>Other members of the task force include KMT Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and
Legislator Wu Den-yih, who is also secretary-general of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Lu said the new measures will still cap the amount that can be exchanged, with
the details to be worked out by the incoming KMT government.</P>
      <P>The yuan and Taiwan dollar have been convertible  on the Taiwan-controlled
islands of Kinmen and Matsu since October 2005. Individuals from either China or
Taiwan with valid travel documents are allowed to exchange up to 20,000 yuan at
designated banks on the islands.</P>
      <P>Individuals may also bring up to 20,000 yuan into Taiwan but cannot exchange it
on Taiwan proper, according to existing clauses in the Statute Governing the
Relations Between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area,</P>
      <P>Lu said the law and regulations will be amended in time to allow the exchange of
a limited amount of the yuan everywhere in Taiwan to coincide with the
implementation of new measures allowing 3,000 Chinese tourists into Taiwan each
day and direct charter flights between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>

      <P>Several Taiwanese expatriate groups will hold a series of activities in London
April 20 to solicit support for Taiwan's bid to enter the World Health
Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Lord Faulkner, co-chairman of the British-Taiwan Parliamentary Group, a sub-
group in Britain's Parliament, will be among those attending the activities,
which will be held at Speaker's Corner in London's Hyde Park.</P>
      <P>Faulkner and his parliamentary group have consistently supported Taiwan's bid to
enter international organizations, including the United Nations and WHO.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-yao, secretary-general of the European Federation of Taiwan Health
Alliance, said Taiwan's membership in the world health body was long overdue.</P>
      <P>"The fact that the WHO has excluded Taiwan from the organization for a long time
has violated the WHO's commitment to safeguarding health rights of the world's
people regardless of sex or race, " Lee told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has attempted to become an observer in the World Health Assembly (WHA) --
the decision-making body of the WHO -- under its official title Republic of
China every year since 1997 but has been rejected due to the opposition of
China, which sees Taiwan as a part of its territory.</P>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan decided to apply for full membership for the first time under
the name Taiwan, which China also successfully rebuffed.</P>
      <P>This year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will ask the country's diplomatic

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) warned consumers Monday that they may be
vulnerable in their own beds, after a survey by Taiwan's standards bureau found
excessive amounts of chemicals in local bedding accessories that could harm
people's health.</P>
      <P>The MOEA's Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection tested 11 randomly
selected accessories, including sheets and pillow cases, and found that three
contained excessive amounts of formaldehyde and five had high levels of
fluorescent substances.</P>
      <P>Formaldehyde is a toxic and flammable substance that is listed by the World
Health Organization (WHO) as a carcinogen and by Taiwan's Environmental
Protection Administration as a kind of toxic chemical.</P>
      <P>Products containing formaldehyde  can cause skin allergies, respiratory problems
or even life threatening pulmonary edema and cancer, the bureau warned in a
statement released Monday.</P>
      <P>Fluorescents also pose a threat of skin allergies.</P>
      <P>In addition, 10 of the 11 samples were found to be lacking basic product
information, including the material used and the name of the manufacturer, in
violation of the Commodity Labeling Law.</P>
      <P>The bureau will order the manufacturers and retailers of the substandard
products to recall and destroy their goods and will conduct more tests on
similar products, the statement said.</P>
      <P>To further prevent potential harm, the bureau advised local consumers to examine
product information before purchasing bedding accessories and check for any
unpleasant smell before use.</P>
      <P>The bureau suggested that washing the fabrics with warm water could eliminate
the formaldehyde and fluorescent substances adhering to their surfaces.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Teacher convicted of sexual assault must be dismissed: group</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Modern Women's Foundation (MWF) on Monday urged a university in Central
Taiwan to dismiss one of its faculties who was convicted of sexually assaulting
one of his students, stressing that this kind of teacher should be "kicked out
of campus."</P>
      <P>The women's group made the appeal as the controversial scandal which happened in
National Chi Nan University (NCNU) in the central county of Nantou, surfaced.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-chih, an associate professor at the Department of Public Policy and
Administration, was accused by one of his female students of sexual assault in
July 2006.</P>
      <P>Lee was convicted of sexual assault by a court in March and sentenced to one
year and two months in prison.</P>
      <P>However, according to Amy Chang, chief executive of the women's foundation, the
university did not dismiss Lee, only suspending him from his job for six months
after the incident became public. In early 2007, he resumed teaching at the
university, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"Because Lee was only suspended from duties instead of being dismissed, he could
return to campus to continue teaching," said Chang.</P>
      <P>"It is really incredible that the NCNU only suspended Lee's duties, which can
only deepen the mental trauma of the victim," Chang said, urging the university
to dismiss Lee in the university administration's upcoming meeting to be held
next week.</P>
      <P>In response to the criticism, Chiang Ta-shu, secretary-general of the NCNU, said
the university allowed Lee to resume teaching because at that time he had not
been sentenced yet, stressing that the NCNU has already suspended Lee following
the announcement of the sentence in March.</P>
      <P>Chiang further said that in the university administration's meeting next week,
the school will reexamine the case and decide whether to dismiss Lee.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the scandal as one of possibly many cases of sexual assault on
campus, Pan Wei-kang, the foundation's president and an incumbent legislator,
said that "I hope that through this case, everyone in society can face such a
task seriously."</P>
      <P>Pan stressed that "to force the teachers like Lee to leave the campus is
fundamental to preventing such cases from happening again and again."</P>
      <P>"The legislature should also regulate laws to supervise the teachers," Pan said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the victim of the scandal even attempted suicide and was
hospitalized for several times, Lai Fang-yu, an attorney for the victim, urged
the university to dismiss the teacher Lee immediately, to prevent him from
returning to campus and to help the student.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with the attorney Lai, Sandy Lai, president of the Taipei Women's
Rescue Foundation, said "if the university doesn't tackle this problem well,
teachers like Lee will become common on campuses."</P>
      <P>"We hope that justice still exists. ... We also hope that the victim in this
case will be the last one who has to hide herself and cry alone without help,"
added Lai.</P>

    <HEADLINE>World Vegetable Center in Taiwan an asset of the world: President</HEADLINE>

04/14/08  22:17:18

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that a world vegetable center headquartered
in southern Taiwan is a precious asset for both the country and the
international community, as it helps innumerable farmers in the world with
important farming technologies.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a ceremony marking the change of the center's name from
the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC) to the AVRDC-the
World Vegetable Center.</P>
      <P>Addressing the re-designation recemony, Chen said the new name is better suited
to the center's current global role.</P>
      <P>The non-profit center was co-founded in 1971 by the Asian Development Bank, as
well as Taiwan, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, the United States and
Vietnam, with the aim of working towards reducing malnutrition and alleviating
poverty in East Asia's developing countries through improved yields and
development of strains adaptable to tropical climates.</P>
      <P>Located in Tainan County's Shanhua township, the center has emerged as the
world's leading organization in vegetable research and development.</P>
      <P>The center has eight regional offices in Asia and Africa and is the only
international organization headquartered in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the past three decades of its operation, Chen said the center has helped
developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Central America to improve their
agricultural, Chen pointed out in a speech at the center.</P>
      <P>Chen said the center has proposed many initiatives to help alleviate poverty
through improved agricultural yields for poor countries. He added that Taiwan,
as a founder, increased its donation amounts in 2006 to support these
initiatives, including one involving setting up a global research  network on
tropical fruits and vegetables.</P>
      <P>Scientists from around the world will be able to work together to attain  food
security,  poverty  alleviation,  and sustainable agriculture, through the
research network.</P>
      <P>Chen said the center has made great contributions to Taiwan's agricultural
development by improving techniques and increasing production value through a
variety of bilateral cooperation projects with both the government and private
sectors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's overseas agricultural aid teams also cooperated with the center in
providing agricultural aid to developing countries, Chen said, adding that
agricultural technology aid is an important link for Taiwan in carrying out its
foreign aid policies.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that the center would draw more international
scientists to join its ranks and generate more attention and awareness of
agriculture's importance among developing countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No sabotage found in derailed train incident: prosecutors</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
04/14/08  22:55:21
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>No signs of sabotage were discovered at the site where a small tourist train
derailed Sunday in one of Taiwan's most famous national scenic areas, local
prosecutors said Monday.</P>
      <P>The investigation was launched soon after the Chiayi Forest District Office,
which manages the mountainous railway network on Alishan, reported a derailment
for the third time in just two weeks.</P>
      <P>The office decided to suspend operations of the railway's main line  beginning
Monday  for  a comprehensive  inspection  and investigation, said office head
Yeh Hsien-liang.</P>
      <P>Service will not be restored until all safety concerns are resolved, Yeh said,
with the only exception an early morning train on a spur line that will continue
to take travelers to see Alishan's famous sunrise.</P>
      <P>Never in the history of the nearly 100-year-old railway, which was inaugurated
in 1912 by the Japanese to transport logs down the mountain, have so many
derailments occurred so closely together, leading some to suspect human sabotage
may have been involved.</P>
      <P>Yeh described the first derailment that occurred on March 30 as an accident and
attributed the cause to mud and rocks that happened to fall on the track.</P>
      <P>The second derailment on April 1 at the same site as the first one was also an
accident because it took place on a rainy day and the track was slippery, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>He was at a loss, however, to explain the latest derailment, which occurred at a
different point on the line. He said his office inspected the locomotive and the
five carriages prior to the accident and found no problems.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the railroad ties in the section where the derailment occurred --
about 30 minutes after the train departed from the station -- had been replaced
several months ago, Yeh said, and no other problems were detected.</P>
      <P>Yeh said none of the 125 passengers on board panicked or were hurt because the
train was operating at a slower-than-usual speed.</P>
      <P>The third accident was different from the previous two in that it was the
locomotive, not the carriages, that derailed.</P>
      <P>Liu Tong-ti, the 57-year-old driver of the train, said that just as the front
carriages of the train were entering a tunnel, he heard unusual sounds coming
from the back of the train where the locomotive was located and put on the
brakes.</P>
      <P>After stepping out of the train to check out what was causing the noises, he
found the locomotive had derailed, Liu said, who noted that the weather and the
track's condition at the time were both fine.</P>
      <P>Lin Shan-ben, an office official, said the only unusual signs found by the
agency's inspection were two three-meter-long markings on the rails that may
indicate the train ran over something.</P>
      <P>The investigation also came amid speculation that the derailment was caused by
sabotage to protest a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project passed in 2006 to
privatize the management of the railway network for the next 30 years.</P>
      <P>One rumor suggested that Chiayi-based Hungtu Construction Co., which won the BOT
bid, did not want to take over the network, which generates NT$100 million
(US$3.3 million) in revenues annually but has cost NT$300 million a year to
operate.</P>
      <P>According to another rumor, low-level train employees were said to be outraged
that the office enriched the construction company by purchasing hundreds of
millions of Taiwan dollars worth of equipment for the railway before Hungtu took
over its operations.</P>
      <P>Yeh dismissed the speculation and insisted the derailments will would not halt
the privatization project because the company has agreed in the contract that it
would unconditionally take over the train network in June.</P>
      <P>The Alishan mountain resort area, known for cherry blossoms and trees that are
thousands of years old, has attracted nearly 900,000 local and foreign visitors
annually in recent years.</P>
      <P>The area's cherry blossom season, which began on March 15, has attracted over
100,000 visitors, many of whom come from China.</P>
      <P>A Chinese tourist surnamed Zheng said Monday that she felt very disappointed by
the suspension of the rail line because she traveled all the way to Taiwan from
China via Thailand in order to take a ride on the forest train, which can take
tourists as high as 2,316 meters above sea level.</P>
      <P>The office now provides shuttle buses to transport tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No substantial gains from Boao Forum: DPP legislative caucus</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
04/14/08  22:58:18
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew has not obtained any substantial gains from
the 2008 Boao Forum on Asia, but his attendance at the forum has in fact upset
Taiwan's status, legislative caucus members of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said Monday.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Yeh Yi-jin and other DPP lawmakers made the remarks
at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan</P>
      <P>Siew of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) returned to Taiwan Sunday with his
13-member delegation after the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2008 was
held from April 11-13 in the southern Chinese province of Hainan. He will be
sworn into office May 20 along with President-elect Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>His attendance at this year's forum made him the first vice president-elect from
Taiwan ever to set foot on Chinese soil -- a milestone in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations since the two sides split in 1949 after a civil war in China.</P>
      <P>Although Siew attended the 2008 Boao Forum in his private capacity as chairman
of the Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation, as he has done over the past five
years, the event sparked grave concern in the pro-independence DPP out of fears
that his presence would undermine Taiwan's international status or benefits due
to the KMT's pro-China stance.</P>
      <P>The Boao Forum  for Asia is a non-government,  non-profit organization dedicated
to trade and economic integration in the region.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Yeh Yi-jin accused Siew of making Taiwan into a
Chinese province by entering China on a special travel document designed by
Beijing for use by Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, she went on, the protocol accorded by Beijing to Siew at Haikou
Airport, as well as the seating arrangements made for him -- in the same row as
the executive chiefs from Hong Kong and Macau -- at the forum's annual
conference Sunday were apparently all attempts by Beijing to downgrade Taiwan's
status to that of a Chinese province and make it an inseparable part of
Beijing's so-called "one China."</P>
      <P>Although Chinese President Hu Jintao responded positively to four requests
raised by Siew during a Saturday meeting on the sidelines of the conference, Yeh
said the four issues -- a resumption of cross-strait dialogue, normalization of
bilateral trade and economic ties, the launch of weekend cross-strait charter
flights and allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan -- were already initiated
in a meeting between Hu and KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan in 2005 in Beijing.</P>
      <P>"The Siew-Hu meeting has actually not brought about any concrete progress in
Taiwan-China ties," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>According to DPP lawmaker Kuan Pi-ling, Taiwan was classified as a "special
administrative region" -- like Hong Kong and Macau -- under China's jurisdiction
in all documents relating to the Boao Forum.</P>
      <P>This will not only mislead the international community to believe that Taiwan is
part of China in line with Beijing's "one China" principle, but will also deeply
hurt Taiwan's interests, she warned.</P>
      <P>In response to the attacks from their DPP counterparts, KMT legislators said
that their party, which will take the reins of power after Ma and Siew take
office, is capable of implementing the agreements reached in the Siew-Hu
meeting.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Lee Chi-chu,  speaking on behalf of the KMT's legislative caucus,
said at a news conference that the meeting helped lay a key foundation in cross-
strait ties -- that two-way relations should be handled through negotiations in
an institutionalized and transparent way by the semiofficial Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Beijing-based counterpart -- the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Lee urged the DPP lawmakers to adopt a positive attitude toward the Siew-Hu
meeting and help push through law amendment proposals regarding issues of major
public concern, such as a quick opening of direct transport links across the
strait and free exchanges of China's currency in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Monday she would welcome Chinese tourists to visit
her port city in southern Taiwan but would not say if she would travel to China
to solicit investment using a special travel document issued by Beijing for
Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from Kuomintang  (KMT)  councilors at a Kaohsiung City
Council session,  Chen said the Kaohsiung City government was ready to make full
preparations for the entry of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Chen is a member of the ruling pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party,
which has long opposed a full range of exchanges between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait and restricted Taiwan businesses from investing in China.</P>
      <P>DPP politicians criticized Vice President-elect Vincent Siew for traveling to
China for this past weekend's Boao Forum for Asia on a "Taiwanese Compatriot
Entry Permit, " which they said belittled Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But the mayor failed to elaborate on whether she would travel to China to woo
Chinese investment to Kaohsiung using the special travel document.</P>
      <P>"As long as the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) gives its go-ahead for Chinese to
invest in Taiwan, Kaohsiung also will welcome Chinese capital," Chen said in
sidestepping the question.</P>
      <P>"I would study the possibility of (visiting China)  on a case-by-case basis for
the sake of Kaohsiung's development, " she added.</P>
      <P>The KMT councilors also asked Chen to push municipal authorities to get ready
for potential investment projects from major Taiwanese companies such as the Hon
Hai Group and Quanta Computer, which are reportedly preparing to invest in
Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>KMT President-elect Ma Ying-jeou has promised to allow the entry of Chinese
tourists to Taiwan and the opening of weekend direct cross-strait charters

technologies,  Chuang Lien-hao, chairman of the association, said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chuang, who is also chief executive of the Kaohsiung-based Winner Group, said
the business center is expected to create NT$60 billion worth of new business
opportunities each year, and that some 300 companies involved in the computer
and information industries have already applied to set up shop in the center.</P>
      <P>The center's building, to be located in the Kaohsiung Software Park, will be
shaped like a flying saucer, with the construction materials and architectural
design aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and minimizing any
environmental impact, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>Citing a few examples, Chuang said that to conserve energy, the roof of the
building will be equipped with a high-efficiency solar energy collection system,
while the design will allow sufficient sunlight to penetrate the structure so
that electric lighting during the daytime will not be needed.</P>
      <P>Other features of the smart building include an automatic rainwater collection
system for watering plants, good ventilation for all rooms on all floors, and a
digital environment for the new generation of wireless Internet users.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF Chairman-designate to travel to China for talks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Monday that he would soon
travel to China for talks on major cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks after president-elect Ma Ying-jeou earlier announced
that he would be appointed as chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Chiang said that before he formerly assumes the post after the incoming KMT
government takes office May 20, he would travel to China in his capacity as SEF
chairman-designate to discuss direct cross-strait transportation links, Chinese
yuan and Taiwan dollar convertibility, and the opening of Taiwan to Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>The 76-year-old  former economic affairs minister and vice Legislative Yuan
speaker said his family was not very supportive of his heading the SEF, a semi-
official body set up by Taiwan's government to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of formal relations.</P>
      <P>But Chiang said he gladly accepted the offer to serve as the top negotiator with
China, especially after KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan expressed his support
the previous night for Chiang to serve in the post.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Chia-chin disclosed earlier the same day that Chiang hopes to
reach an agreement or "tacit understanding" with China on major cross-strait
issues during the upcoming visit.</P>
      <P>"But the signing of a formal agreement will have to wait until after May 20,"
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Chiang's upcoming visit is expected to revive long-stalled cross-strait talks
after nearly a decade of inactivities. A window of opportunity for improved
cross-strait ties emerged after a goodwill meeting between Vice President-elect
Vincent Siew and Chinese President Hu Jintao at an economic forum in China over
the weekend.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that Chen Yunlin, director of Taiwan Affairs Office under the
State Council, will be designated as the chairman of the Beijing-based
Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), the SEF's Chinese
counterpart.</P>
      <P>A meeting between former SEF Chairman Ku Cheng-fu and former ARATS Chairman Wang
Daohan in Singapore in 1993 brought a series of systematic exchanges between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait following nearly five decades without official
contacts.</P>
      <P>But the communications were disrupted after former President Lee Teng-hui
described the cross-strait relationship as a "special state-to-state" one in
1999.</P>

      <P>"Time and wisdom" will be needed to melt long-frozen cross-Taiwan Strait
relations,  Vice President-elect Vincent Siew said Monday.</P>
      <P>Although his just-concluded visit to southern China's Hainan province  was a
"journey  of melting the ice" in the frosty relationship between Taiwan and
China, Siew said he hopes the iceberg will not melt too fast.</P>
      <P>"It will become a flood if it melts too fast, " Siew said, noting that time and
wisdom are needed to develop contacts between Taipei and Beijing and, therefore,
there was no timetable for the resumption of direct cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>The vice president-elect made the remarks in answering questions from Hong Kong
reporters at a news conference held jointly with President-elect Ma Ying-jeou a
day after Siew returned from a historic visit in Hainan province.</P>
      <P>Siew was there to attend the 2008 Boao Forum for Asia and met with Chinese
President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the event.</P>
      <P>Siew said he discovered during the meeting that Hu held a pragmatic and friendly
attitude on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the Boao Forum, Siew described the annual event as a platform for
international and cross-strait exchanges and lauded the inclusion of a
roundtable forum on the agenda to discus issues related to Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Siew saw the discussion as a channel for the two sides to conduct dialogue and
reduce misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>The Monday press conference was divided into two sessions, with the first
attended by reporters from 14 Hong Kong media outlets to interview Taiwan's new
leaders.</P>
      <P>The second part of the conference was opened for local and foreign reporters.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Cultural Association launched two books Monday on special features
of southern Taiwan as part of an ongoing program to document Taiwan's local
cultures and history and develop materials for a homeland study curriculum.</P>
      <P>Tchen Yu-chiou, secretary general of the association, said the two books -- one
about Kaohsiung County and one on Pingtung County -- took scholars, elementary
and junior high school teachers, and people who work in the field, three years
to research and write.</P>
      <P>"The book is aimed at representing Taiwan's cultures with insights from local
perspectives," Tchen said.</P>
      <P>The publishing of the two books is part of a program called Window on Taiwan
that started in 2004. The program hopes to construct a library that introduces
history, culture, geography, special events, and the heritages of Taiwan's 319
townships, in both digital and written forms.</P>
      <P>The program was organized by the association at the instruction of the Ministry
of Educaiton and with the assistance of local governments, Tchen said.</P>
      <P>Education  Minister Tu Cheng-sheng  said the program helps strengthen students'
understanding  of Taiwan and its regional characteristics, which will help them
identify with the land they live on.</P>
      <P>"Identity formulation" is an important part of school education, Tu said, adding
that this formulation would allow the next generation to know where they are
standing when they face the world.</P>
      <P>Tchen said books about Taipei County and Taoyuan County in northern Taiwan and
Yunlin County in southern Taiwan have already been published, and books about
Chiayi County and Kaohsiung City in northern Taiwan, Hualien County in eastern
Taiwan and offshore Kinmen County will be published in June.</P>
      <P>Books about Taichung City, Taichung County, Changhua County, and Nantou County
in central Taiwan, and Taitung County in eastern Taiwan are scheduled to be
published next year.</P>
      <P>Tchen said all the books will be sent to elementary and junior high schools
around the nation to be used as references by teachers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that he will still attend events in
memory of a massacre in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989 after he takes
office, but in different ways.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has attended similar events every year since 1989 when Chinese troops
killed hundreds of people, most of them students who had occupied Tiananmen
Square in a demonstration for freedom and democracy in China.</P>
      <P>Ma did not elaborate on what he would do, however, saying only that he "will
tell everybody when the time approaches."</P>
      <P>The president-elect was speaking at a news conference for reporters from Hong
Kong one day after Vice President-elect Vincent Siew returned from a three-day
trip to southern China, during which he met Chinese President Hu Jintao for 20
minutes on the sidelines of a China-hosted economic forum.</P>
      <P>The meeting was generally seen as a positive first step in developing improved
relations between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Asked if both sides would again choose Hong Kong as a venue for cross-strait
talks, Ma replied that there will be no restriction on where to hold the talks
as long as it was acceptable to both sides.</P>
      <P>In the past, some of the talks were held in Taiwan and some in China, Ma said,
adding that Hong Kong's status is now different than it was in 1992 when high-
level representatives from Taiwan and China reached what Ma's KMT, describes as
the "1992 consensus" at a historic meeting there.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT, the "1992 consensus, " a term coined by former Mainland
Affairs Council Chairman Su Chi of the KMT in 2000, was a formula to help the
two sides to skirt the issue of Taiwan' s sovereignty in official talks.</P>
      <P>Under the formula, that China has yet to accept, both sides agree that there is
"one China, " but with different interpretations of how it is defined.</P>
      <P>When the 1992 meeting took place, Hong Kong was still a British colony. The
United Kingdom handed over Hong Kong to China in 1997.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ma told the reporters that Hong Kong will not be affected if direct
transport links are opened between Taiwan and China because he said that Hong
Kong will remain as a transit point between Taiwan and Southeast Asian
countries.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said that Taiwanese tourists outperform other foreign visitors
to Hong Kong in terms of personal consumption.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was born in Hong Kong, said he hopes that private and official exchanges
between Taiwan and Hong Kong will be intensified in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC to adopt two-stage approach on convertibility of Chinese yuan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of the Republic of China (CBC) said Monday that it plans to
adopt a two-stage approach in introducing full convertibility between the
Chinese yuan and the New Taiwan dollar in Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>CBC officials said the exchange of Chinese yuan, which has been allowed since
October 2005 in the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, will require a
revision of the law, referring to an amendment of the Statute Governing the
Relations Between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>After both sides sign an agreement on a currency clearance and settlement
mechanism,  the yuan and Taiwan dollar will become convertible in Taiwan proper,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>But before the signing of such an agreement, the central bank will follow a two-
stage approach, they said.</P>
      <P>Because of the uncertainty of the supply of Chinese yuan at local banks, the
central bank in the initial stage will only allow financial institutions to buy
Chinese yuan in exchange for Taiwan dollars, they added.</P>
      <P>In the second stage, if the central bank is confident of a stable supply of
yuan, which could be provided by inbound tourists from China, it will permit
financial institutions to both buy and sell the Chinese currency.</P>
      <P>In anticipation that the yuan will soon be traded in local banks, the central
bank has sponsored seven seminars on how to identify counterfeit yuan.</P>
      <P>Starting this month, it will open more classes to familiarize banking clerks
with techniques to detect forged yuan.</P>
      <P>Central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan is expected to report on the exchange of
yuan and the Taiwan dollar in front of a legislative committee Tuesday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that a world vegetable center headquartered
in southern Taiwan is a precious asset for both the country and the
international community, as it helps innumerable farmers in the world with
important farming technologies.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a ceremony marking the change of the center's name from
the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC) to the AVRDC-the
World Vegetable Center.</P>
      <P>Addressing the re-designation recemony, Chen said the new name is better suited
to the center's current global role.</P>
      <P>The non-profit center was co-founded in 1971 by the Asian Development Bank, as
well as Taiwan, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, the United States and
Vietnam, with the aim of working towards reducing malnutrition and alleviating
poverty in East Asia's developing countries through improved yields and
development of strains adaptable to tropical climates.</P>
      <P>Located in Tainan County's Shanhua township, the center has emerged as the
world's leading organization in vegetable research and development.</P>
      <P>The center has eight regional offices in Asia and Africa and is the only
international organization headquartered in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the past three decades of its operation, Chen said the center has helped
developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Central America to improve their
agricultural, Chen pointed out in a speech at the center.</P>
      <P>Chen said the center has proposed many initiatives to help alleviate poverty
through improved agricultural yields for poor countries. He added that Taiwan,
as a founder, increased its donation amounts in 2006 to support these
initiatives, including one involving setting up a global research  network on
tropical fruits and vegetables.</P>
      <P>Scientists from around the world will be able to work together to attain  food
security,  poverty  alleviation,  and sustainable agriculture, through the
research network.</P>
      <P>Chen said the center has made great contributions to Taiwan's agricultural
development by improving techniques and increasing production value through a
variety of bilateral cooperation projects with both the government and private
sectors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's overseas agricultural aid teams also cooperated with the center in
providing agricultural aid to developing countries, Chen said, adding that
agricultural technology aid is an important link for Taiwan in carrying out its
foreign aid policies.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that the center would draw more international
scientists to join its ranks and generate more attention and awareness of
agriculture's importance among developing countries.</P>

      <P>No signs of sabotage were discovered at the site where a small tourist train
derailed Sunday in one of Taiwan's most famous national scenic areas, local
prosecutors said Monday.</P>
      <P>The investigation was launched soon after the Chiayi Forest District Office,
which manages the mountainous railway network on Alishan, reported a derailment
for the third time in just two weeks.</P>
      <P>The office decided to suspend operations of the railway's main line  beginning
Monday  for  a comprehensive  inspection  and investigation, said office head
Yeh Hsien-liang.</P>
      <P>Service will not be restored until all safety concerns are resolved, Yeh said,
with the only exception an early morning train on a spur line that will continue
to take travelers to see Alishan's famous sunrise.</P>
      <P>Never in the history of the nearly 100-year-old railway, which was inaugurated
in 1912 by the Japanese to transport logs down the mountain, have so many
derailments occurred so closely together, leading some to suspect human sabotage
may have been involved.</P>
      <P>Yeh described the first derailment that occurred on March 30 as an accident and
attributed the cause to mud and rocks that happened to fall on the track.</P>
      <P>The second derailment on April 1 at the same site as the first one was also an
accident because it took place on a rainy day and the track was slippery, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>He was at a loss, however, to explain the latest derailment, which occurred at a
different point on the line. He said his office inspected the locomotive and the
five carriages prior to the accident and found no problems.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the railroad ties in the section where the derailment occurred --
about 30 minutes after the train departed from the station -- had been replaced
several months ago, Yeh said, and no other problems were detected.</P>
      <P>Yeh said none of the 125 passengers on board panicked or were hurt because the
train was operating at a slower-than-usual speed.</P>
      <P>The third accident was different from the previous two in that it was the
locomotive, not the carriages, that derailed.</P>
      <P>Liu Tong-ti, the 57-year-old driver of the train, said that just as the front
carriages of the train were entering a tunnel, he heard unusual sounds coming
from the back of the train where the locomotive was located and put on the
brakes.</P>
      <P>After stepping out of the train to check out what was causing the noises, he
found the locomotive had derailed, Liu said, who noted that the weather and the
track's condition at the time were both fine.</P>
      <P>Lin Shan-ben, an office official, said the only unusual signs found by the
agency's inspection were two three-meter-long markings on the rails that may
indicate the train ran over something.</P>
      <P>The investigation also came amid speculation that the derailment was caused by
sabotage to protest a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project passed in 2006 to
privatize the management of the railway network for the next 30 years.</P>
      <P>One rumor suggested that Chiayi-based Hungtu Construction Co., which won the BOT
bid, did not want to take over the network, which generates NT$100 million
(US$3.3 million) in revenues annually but has cost NT$300 million a year to
operate.</P>
      <P>According to another rumor, low-level train employees were said to be outraged
that the office enriched the construction company by purchasing hundreds of
millions of Taiwan dollars worth of equipment for the railway before Hungtu took
over its operations.</P>
      <P>Yeh dismissed the speculation and insisted the derailments will would not halt
the privatization project because the company has agreed in the contract that it
would unconditionally take over the train network in June.</P>
      <P>The Alishan mountain resort area, known for cherry blossoms and trees that are
thousands of years old, has attracted nearly 900,000 local and foreign visitors
annually in recent years.</P>
      <P>The area's cherry blossom season, which began on March 15, has attracted over
100,000 visitors, many of whom come from China.</P>
      <P>A Chinese tourist surnamed Zheng said Monday that she felt very disappointed by
the suspension of the rail line because she traveled all the way to Taiwan from
China via Thailand in order to take a ride on the forest train, which can take
tourists as high as 2,316 meters above sea level.</P>
      <P>The office now provides shuttle buses to transport tourists.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Monday that he would soon
travel to China for talks on major cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks after president-elect Ma Ying-jeou earlier announced
that he would be appointed as chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Chiang said that before he formerly assumes the post after the incoming KMT
government takes office May 20, he would travel to China in his capacity as SEF
chairman-designate to discuss direct cross-strait transportation links, Chinese
yuan and Taiwan dollar convertibility, and the opening of Taiwan to Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>The 76-year-old  former economic affairs minister and vice Legislative Yuan
speaker said his family was not very supportive of his heading the SEF, a semi-
official body set up by Taiwan's government to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of formal relations.</P>
      <P>But Chiang said he gladly accepted the offer to serve as the top negotiator with
China, especially after KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan expressed his support
the previous night for Chiang to serve in the post.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Chia-chin disclosed earlier the same day that Chiang hopes to
reach an agreement or "tacit understanding" with China on major cross-strait
issues during the upcoming visit.</P>
      <P>"But the signing of a formal agreement will have to wait until after May 20,"
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Chiang's upcoming visit is expected to revive long-stalled cross-strait talks
after nearly a decade of inactivities. A window of opportunity for improved
cross-strait ties emerged after a goodwill meeting between Vice President-elect
Vincent Siew and Chinese President Hu Jintao at an economic forum in China over
the weekend.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that Chen Yunlin, director of Taiwan Affairs Office under the
State Council, will be designated as the chairman of the Beijing-based
Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), the SEF's Chinese
counterpart.</P>
      <P>A meeting between former SEF Chairman Ku Cheng-fu and former ARATS Chairman Wang
Daohan in Singapore in 1993 brought a series of systematic exchanges between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait following nearly five decades without official
contacts.</P>
      <P>But the communications were disrupted after former President Lee Teng-hui
described the cross-strait relationship as a "special state-to-state" one in
1999.</P>

International Airport to be closed for four hours.</P>
      <P>No casualties were reported. Officials at the Civil Aeronautics Administration
and the Aviation Safety Council said they are investigating the cause behind the
accident.</P>
      <P>The MD-90 aircraft carrying 36 passengers and six crew members was flying from
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport to Kaohsiung when the accident occurred,
the airline said.</P>
      <P>Detecting abnormalities in the tire pressure and cabin doors soon after the
plane took off from Taoyuan International Airport at 8: 45 a.m.,  the pilot
immediately notified controllers at Kaohsiung International Airport of the
situation, the carrier said.</P>
      <P>As the plane approached, airport controllers saw that one of the aircraft's
tires had burst and instructed the pilot to keep the aircraft hovering to burn
most of its remaining fuel and prevent a potential explosion during landing, the
airline said.</P>
      <P>Because of pressure imbalances, two other tires of the aircraft burst during
landing at 9:55 a.m., causing the plane to veer off the runway.</P>
      <P>The aircraft, owned by EVA Air subsidiary Uni Air, flew back safely to Taoyuan

      <P>Speaking with reporters after a municipal government meeting, Taipei City
Government spokesman Yang Hsiao-tung said that there are currently 3,400 bins
for collecting old furniture at locations around the city.</P>
      <P>Yang quoted Hau as having said during the meeting that the city government will
continue with the policy even though some citizens have taken advantage of the
situation by dumping their regular garbage in the bins.</P>
      <P>"We shouldn't cause an inconvenience for the majority of the citizens by

      <P>Taiwan's central bank said Tuesday that it is fully prepared for full
convertibility between the Taiwan dollar and Chinese yuan but insisted that
regulations needed to be revised before any currency exchange system could take
effect.</P>
      <P>"The central bank is fully prepared for the new measure, " Central Bank of the
Republic of China Vice-Governor George Chou said at a legislative hearing, but
he said his bank did not have any yuan to sell to local buyers.</P>
      <P>"Chinese yuan will have to be obtained from Chinese tourists to Taiwan," he
said.</P>
      <P>Chou insisted, however, that a plan by Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers to launch
exchange facilities for the two currencies without amending existing regulations
was not feasible.</P>
      <P>He said that as the yuan is not a fully-convertible currency, Taiwan and China
needed to reach agreement on a currency clearance and settlement mechanism,
which would inevitably require a revision of applicable statutes.</P>
      <P>Some countries, including China, restrict fluctuations in their currency's
exchange rates and require permits to exchange large sums, limiting the
currency's convertibility.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou recently committed to opening the free exchange of
the Chinese yuan in Taiwan, and the central bank said Monday it would follow a
two-step approach to achieve the goal.</P>
      <P>Individuals have been allowed to exchange up to 20,000 yuan on the Taiwan-
controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu, which lie just off China's southeastern
coast, since October 2005.</P>
      <P>But with an agreement on the arrival of Chinese tourists in Taiwan expected to
be reached after the new government takes office, yuan convertibility on Taiwan
proper has become a pressing issue.</P>
      <P>Chou urged the Mainland Affairs Council to continue negotiating a clearance and
settlement mechanism with China to cement the plan.</P>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman-designate Chiang Pin-kung is expected to
visit China in the near future to lay the groundwork for agreements on a number
of issues, including the arrival of Chinese tourists and yuan convertibility.</P>
      <P>Chou said one benefit of a legalized exchange mechanism would be to clamp down
on black market yuan-Taiwan dollar trading, which was estimated at NT$77.78
billion between 2002 and 2006.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chou also said the central bank is working on ways to promote easier
ways to arrange direct transfers involving Taiwan dollars and the yuan,
especially with so many Taiwanese businesses operating in China.</P>
      <P>"Direct fund transfer reduces costs and time, and could also earn banks more
business," Chou said.</P>

      <P>Ball pools affiliated with playgrounds in the Taipei area are mostly filthy,
containing a high concentration of germs that pose a health risk to children,
the Consumers' Foundation (CF) said Tuesday, urging the relevant authorities,
playground operators and parents to pay attention to the problem.</P>
      <P>The CF officials made the statement on completion of its inspection of eight
ball pools, including those at IKEA, the Y-17, Kid's Park, Tom Dragon Castle,
Hsin-Yi Foundation, and Taipei Wanhua Sports Center.</P>
      <P>The findings indicate that high concentrations of colony forming unit (CFU) were
commonly found on the surfaces of the balls tested, and two of the 24 samples
recorded 10,000 to 100,000 CFUs, Cheng Jen-hung, chairman of the CF, claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen said that colon bacilli and other germs were also found on the balls.</P>
      <P>"The ball pools are polluted K and Staphylococcus aureus which causes nausea,
vomiting, and food poisoning was also found," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the results of the investigation also showed that most of the
operators failed to provide detailed information on how often they clean the
ball pools and how they disinfect the balls and the facilities, said CF's deputy
director Lee Cherh-yu.</P>
      <P>"We sincerely hope that the operators will provide consumers with that
information," Lee said. "The consumers need to put pressure on the operators to
achieve better management of the pools."</P>
      <P>Hsieh Tien-jen, vice chairman of the CF, stressed that "the operators  must
clean not only the balls but also the pools thoroughly," noting that some items
such as pencils and hair grips that could be hazardous to children were also
seen in the pools.</P>
      <P>In order to safeguard customers' right to information as well as public health,
the ball pool operators should improve thieir efforts at cleaning and
disinfecting the pools, and should post clearly written rule for the users to
follow, Chen urged.</P>
      <P>"The authorities also need to regulate the operations" to make every ball pool a
pleasant, clean, and safe place for children to play, Chen suggested.</P>

Information has refused to issue press passes to Taiwanese journalists to cover
WHA-related activities on the grounds that Taiwan is not a U.N. member.</P>
      <P>The IFJ also expressed its support for a demand by its branch in Taiwan -- the
Association of Taiwan Journalists -- that the U.N. lift the ban.</P>
      <P>The federation argued that the U.N. should allow Taiwanese reporters access to
the WHA meeting in accordance with Article 19 of the U.N. Universal Declaration
of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>It stipulates that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression,
and that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and
to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and
regardless of frontiers.</P>
      <P>Noting that the controversy over China's national sovereignty and territory
should not affect reporters' right to gather information, the IFJ requested that
the U.N. and WHO protect the right of Taiwanese journalists to cover the
conference.</P>
      <P>IFJ Deputy Secretary-General Paco Audije said he could not understand the U.N.'s
denial of the rights of Taiwanese journalists.</P>
      <P>"Those reporters just want to fulfill their responsibility, and since they have
nothing to do with politics, they should not be subject to such discrimination,"
he said.</P>

      <P>Hong Kong's tourism sector Tuesday</P>
      <P>welcomed a proposal to grant Hong Kong visitors to Taiwan visa-free privileges
and predicted that such a move would boost arrivals in Taiwan of tourists from
the former British colony.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's president-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who will take office May 20, said Monday
at a news conference with Hong Kong reporters that his incoming administration
will consider offering the special treatment to Hong Kong tourists as part of a
package of measures aimed at stepping up bilateral ties between Taiwan and Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>Wang Chun-bao, the director of the non-profit, tourism-promotion Taiwan Visitors
Association Hong Kong Office, told the Central News Agency that the measure, if
really implemented,  will bolster Taiwan-Hong Kong exchanges and help lure Hong
Kong tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The number of Hong Kong visitors to Taiwan will grow by 10 percent or more
after the implementation of the measure, " Wang predicted.</P>
      <P>A ranking Hong Kong Tourism Board official surnamed Liu agreed that the number
of Hong Kong tourists to Taiwan would increase if Hong Kong residents were given
visa-free privileges.</P>
      <P>But he believed that passenger volume between the two sides would not be
markedly affected in the short term.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong also is a major transshipment hub for China-bound Taiwanese
passengers.</P>
      <P>A general manager at a Hong Kong travel agency said the visa-free status would
save Hong Kong visitors to Taiwan the HK$100 visa fee. He also expected the move
would lead to a 10 percent rise in the number of Hong Kong tourists visiting
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by Taiwan's Tourism Bureau, there were 3.72
million foreign visitor arrivals in Taiwan in 2007.</P>
      <P>Of that total, 13.2 percent, or 491,437 visitors, came from Hong Kong and Macau

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that it is closely watching
the upcoming presidential elections in Paraguay and the Dominican Republic, two
of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in South America and the Caribbean, especially as
one of the candidates in Paraguay is known to be pro-China.</P>
      <P>Paraguay and the Dominican Republic will hold their presidential elections on
April 20 and May 16, respectively, at a sensitive time for Taiwan, just before
the May 20 inauguration of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Simon Ko, director-general of the MOFA's Central and South American Affairs said
at a regular press briefing that, among the four candidates in Paraguay, the
front-runners are former Catholic Bishop Fernando Lugo of the opposition
Patriotic Alliance for Change (APC), retired army general Lino Oviedo of the
opposition National Union of Ethical Citizens (UNACE), and Blanca Ovelar of the
ruling National Republican Association -- Colorado Party.</P>
      <P>"The latest polls showed that the election was too close to call, but the MOFA
is paying close attention to it," Ko said.</P>
      <P>Former education minister Ovelar is seeking to become the first female leader in
Paraguay. The center-right Colorado Party has been in power in the South
American country for more than six decades but the party is facing a big
challenge in next Sunday's presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to the latest poll in Paraguay, Lugo is leading the field with 34.5
percent of the potential vote, followed by Oviedo with 28.9 percent and Ovelar
with 28.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Ko said Lugo has stated during his campaign that he would like to establish
relations with China if he is elected, giving rise to speculation on whether
Taiwan will lose its only diplomatic ally in South American to China.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the outcome of the presidential race in the Caribbean country of
the Dominican Republic appears to be less uncertain.</P>
      <P>Ko said incumbent President Leonel Fernandez, who is seeking a third consecutive
term with his Dominican Liberation Party, is the front-runner. According to a
Bloomberg report, Fernandez has widened his lead over his closest rival to 24
percentage points, with less than two months to go before the country's
presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New test to speed up detection of dengue fever in inbound travelers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15 (CNA)
04/15/08  18:00:27
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday it will begin using a fast-reacting
blood serum test beginning next month to determine if inbound passengers have
been infected with dengue fever more quickly than in the past.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-hsiung, a researcher at the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said
the blood serum reagent kits will reveal if inbound passengers at ports or
airports with high temperatures have been infected with dengue fever between
five and 30 minutes after collecting drops of their blood.</P>
      <P>Health officials will advise passengers who test positive to go to contracted
hospitals for further examination, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Three-fourths of more than 170 travelers who entered Taiwan with dengue fever
last year were found to have had high temperatures at ports or airports and had
their blood tested, but it took too long for the results to come back.</P>
      <P>"Those people would only be notified of their infection two or three days after
entering Taiwan, " Huang said. "They could have infected others during the
period."</P>
      <P>Wu Ho-sheng, director of the Centers for Disease Control Research and Diagnostic
Center, said that because it is difficult to take blood samples from the elderly
and children, the centers will also use saliva screening to test for the virus.</P>
      <P>The drawback is that saliva testing is even less accurate than the blood serum
tests, which are said to be 60 percent accurate. Of six dengue fever patients
who tested positive through serum tests, only three were found positive in
saliva screening, Wu said.</P>
      <P>This is why the CDC is planning to expand saliva collection from the elderly,
children or volunteers, in the second half of the year, hoping to collect 20
positive cases for further assessment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two algae extracts prove helpful to patients with metabolic syndrome</HEADLINE>

04/15/08  18:22:39
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A government-run aquaculture laboratory has developed two food ingredients based
on algae extracts that proved effective in mitigating metabolic syndrome by
controlling blood pressure levels and blood fat, the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ingredients developed by the COA's Fisheries Research Institute (FRI) are
Fuso-trehalose -- a sugar that exists in algae, mushroom, bean, shrimp and bread
-- and "instant kanten" -- the Japanese name for agar.</P>
      <P>Wu Chun-heng, director of the FRI's Seafood Technology Division, said that in
addition to the effect in moderating blood pressure and lipid level, Fuso-
trehalose is also capable of enhancing the defensive mechanism against
pathogenic viruses and bacteria in the human immune system.</P>
      <P>"Japan physicians have long experience in using trehalose compounds as a
supplementary treatment for cancer patients," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu said Fuso-trehalose can be used as food ingredient because its chemical
structure can sustain environments of 121 Celsius degrees for 30 minutes or 100
Celsius degrees for one hour --  the temperatures and times usually used for
food sterilization.</P>
      <P>Besides, the trehalose made by Japanese companies has only 80-percent purity,
while the FRI's Fuso-trehalose has a purity of 90 percent  or higher,  which
makes the refined ingredient  very competitive in the market, Wu said, adding
that the relevant technologies have been passed on to a local company.</P>
      <P>In the case of instant kanten, Wu said the products currently available on the
market are neither easy to cook nor easy to carry, thus the FRI came up with the
idea of making instant noodle-like kanten products, which contain kanten powder
that can be brewed with hot water at 85 Celsius degrees.</P>
      <P>FRI Researchers said that dietary fiber-laced kanten can be used as meal
replacements for patients with metabolic syndrome or persons who wish to control
their body weight.</P>

      <P>With April 22 World Earth Day approaching, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang
Chiu-hsing urged the public Monday to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
not overeating.</P>
      <P>Yang issued the call while leading a group of Kaohsiung County government high-
ranking officials at County Hall's dining room to use non-disposable chopsticks.
Also present was Wang Mao-song, director of Kaohsiung County's Environmental
Protection Bureau.</P>
      <P>If people do not overeat on a daily basis, less gas and electricity will be
consumed and lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions will be produced, which
will help minimize global warming, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that the level of carbon dioxide emissions in Taiwan averages 12
tons per person per year, some three times higher than the average global
figure, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Figures also show that 2.8 million pairs of disposable chopsticks are used in
Taiwan every year,  which is equivalent  to the deforestation of 540 hectares of
bamboo, said Wang. He suggested that people should use reusable chopsticks
instead of disposable ones, which are proven to contain bleaching agents
detrimental to human health.</P>
      <P>Wang also urged members of public to replace incandescent light bulbs with other
energy-saving and high-efficiency lighting devices and share vehicles or walk
when commuting between work and home in order to help reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.</P>

      <P>A young Filipina, Judith Miguel Pascual, may be among the big beneficiaries of
the newly established Direct Hiring Service Center (DHSC), as she is now free
from brokerage fees and can save money to buy a house in her home country.</P>
      <P>When Pascual came to work in Taiwan for the first time more than three years
ago, she had to pay a considerable sum of money to employment agencies both in
the Philippines and in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But when her employer recently renewed her contract through the DHSC, Pascual
did not have to pay any brokerage fees or placement fees.</P>
      <P>She said that throughout the three years of her first contract, an agency in
Taiwan deducted about NT$1,500-NT$1,800 in brokerage fees from her monthly wage
of about NT$16,000 -- deductions that amounted to almost NT$20,000 per year.</P>
      <P>"Without those additional charges, I can now save enough money to buy my family
a house in the Philippines," said Pascual.</P>
      <P>The DHSC, established in late December 2007 with the main objective of
streamlining the process of hiring foreign caretakers, has proved effective,
said Tsao Ai-lan, the deputy chairwoman of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>"Through the DHSC, both hirers and foreign employees can save time and money,
and the application process is much more efficient, " Tsao said at a press
conference.</P>
      <P>Before the DHSC was established, caretakers who wished to renew their contract
with the same employers had to first return to their home countries and wait at
least two or three weeks -- in some cases up to three months -- for the relevant
documents to be processed before they could re-enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But through the DHSC, Taiwanese employers can now apply to renew the work permit
of the same caretaker about four months before the contract expires, which can
cut the waiting period for re-entry to Taiwan to a minimum of one day, in
express cases, Tsao said.</P>
      <P>The process is convenient for busy employers or those in urgent need of a
helper, she added.</P>
      <P>"Under this new measure system, I saved about NT$5,000-NT$10,000 in agency fees
when I renewed Judith's contract," said Pascual's employer Yang Zi-hua.</P>
      <P>"We hope that employers will make good use of the DHSC, which also benefits
foreign workers," said Tsao.</P>
      <P>The DHSC will allow employers to hire caretakers directly from the Philippines,
Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Mongolia.</P>
      <P>About 160,000 foreign caretakers work in Taiwan, accounting for almost half of
the 360,000 foreign laborers from primarily Indonesia, Thailand and the
Philippines, according to the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>More information on the DHSC application process is available at the DHSC and
local employment services centers.</P>

      <P>The government will consider a call by lawmakers to resume cultivation of fallow
rice paddy to curb an increased food shortage across the globe, a government
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang You-tsai, director of the Agriculture and Food Agency under the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture (COA) , made the remarks after legislative caucus
members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) issued the proposal at
a news conference earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the government could allow rice paddies that have lain
fallow to be plowed under at any time, although it has adjusted its rice
production policy after Taiwan entered the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Compared to other Asian countries, Taiwan's rice prices remain relatively
stable, having increased by only 13 percent this year, Huang said.</P>
      <P>To cope with possible food shortages, the government has always maintained a
safe level of rice stocks -- some 310,000 tons at present -- which can be
released in emergencies, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The central government has since January this year been offering free rice to
low income families across Taiwan -- 0.4 kg per person per day distributed by
local governments -- he said, adding that as much as nearly 1,000 metric tons
has been given away.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Legislative Yuan news conference earlier in the day, DPP
legislative caucus whip William Lai proposed that the Executive Yuan study the
feasibility of replanting rice on some 220,000 hectares of farmland that has
been lying fallow, in light of a growing food scarcity across the globe that has
led to riots in several countries.</P>
      <P>Although rice prices in Taiwan have increased only slightly compared to some
other countries, Lai contended that the government must  take precautions

awareness of enterovirus prevention, aimed at developing correct hand-washing
habits among elementary and preschool children, a local official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Su Chuan-chuan, deputy director-general of the city's Department of Health, said
the Kaohsiung city government has co-operated with the Ronald McDonald House
Charities  in Taiwan --  a charity organization founded by the McDonald Corp. --
to present promotional activities at seven local elementary schools, the first
of which was held at the Lung Hua Elementary School a day earlier.</P>
      <P>According to Su, Kaohsiung City has had four serious cases of enterovirus
infection reported to date this year, a relatively high number compared to the
one serious case reported during the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Summer and early fall are usually peak seasons for enterovirus infection, but in
Taiwan, a subtropical country, infection can occur throughout the whole year, Su
said.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus, a common cause of diseases such as meningitis and myocarditis,  can
be contracted  through  direct contact  with contaminated sources such as
respiratory secretions. The virus enters the body through the gastrointestinal
tract, where it thrives, and can move on to attack the central nervous system.</P>
      <P>An infected person usually develops either a rash or a flu-like illness with
fever and muscle aches.</P>
      <P>Children are more susceptible to the infection than healthy adults, Su went on,
adding that 85 percent of infections in children occur in those aged under 5,
with 73 percent of those reported in children aged under 3.</P>
      <P>No vaccine  is available  to curb the virus and frequent hand-washing and
regular exercise are the most effective ways of preventing infection, Su said.</P>
      <P>The school tour will promote correct hand washing among school children, who
will be reminded to wash their hands on at least five occasions -- before
eating, before playing with babies, after using the toilet, after blowing the
nose and before and after visiting hospitals, Su said.</P>
      <P>She also called on parents to change their clothes and wash their hands before
cuddling or feeding infants.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that the Russian parliament,
which was elected at the end of last year, has established for a second time a
Taiwan amity group to consolidate exchanges between Taiwan and Russia.</P>
      <P>Ali Yang, the newly designated deputy director-general of the MOFA's Department
of West Asian Affairs, said at a regular press briefing that the State Duma --
Russia's lower house of parliament -- on April 9 established the Russian
Parliamentary Group of the State Duma for the Relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The establishment of the group represents the development of bilateral
exchanges between Taiwan and Russia," Yang said.</P>
      <P>The group was first established in 2004 by parliamentarians of the State Duma to
promote bilateral exchanges in the fields of economy, trade, technology and
education -- areas in which the two countries have cooperated over the past
years although there are no diplomatic relations between them.</P>
      <P>However, the group was dissolved when a new parliament was re-elected last
December.</P>
      <P>Yang quoted the group's new chairman Oleg Korgunov as saying that Taiwan's
economic achievement and democratic development are well- known in the world and
that he will continue to promote bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and Russia.</P>
      <P>Yang said the Russian Academy of Engineering Sciences' selection of Taiwanese
Professor Liou Yuei-an of National Central University's Center for Space and
Remote Sensing Research as a foreign member in mid-Feb was a reflection of the
close bilateral links.</P>
      <P>Liou's appointment marked the second time that a Taiwanese scholar was awarded
such a prestigious title by the 900-member Russian academy. Tsai Chen-shui, a
member of Taiwan's Academia Sinica and a professor at National Taiwan
University, in 2001 became the first Taiwanese member of the group.</P>
      <P>As to whether Russia will send an envoy to attend President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's
inauguration May 20, Yang said Taiwan's representative office in Russia had
notified its Russian counterpart of the event but had not yet received a
response.</P>
      <P>He said Russia adheres to the one-China policy and therefore there are no
official exchanges between Taiwan and Russia.</P>

      <P>Li Ka Shing, the richest Chinese person in the world, said Tuesday that his
conglomerate might invest in Taiwan with the prospects of improved ties between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Li, chairman of Hong Kong-based Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., made the remarks
while attending the inauguration ceremony of the Hong Kong-Changzhou Trading
Association, which is composed of businessmen from Hong Kong and Changzhou, in
China's Jiangsu Province.</P>
      <P>Asked by journalists if his conglomerate will consider investing in Taiwan as
relations between the two sides of the strait seem to have relaxed following a
historic meeting between Taiwan's Vice President-elect Vincent Siew and Chinese
President Hu Jintao at an economic forum in China,  Li said he will not rule out
the possibility.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether the series of policies the Chinese government has
adopted to curb its overheated economy has affected his business in China, Li
said that "there has been only limited impact" as his business dealings are
diverse and his employees perform well.</P>
      <P>Li, who has an estimated fortune of some US$26.5 billion, tops Forbes' list of
richest people of Chinese descent this year. His conglomerate covers a wide
variety of business, including real estate, electricity, telecommunications,

      <P>The Hsinchu county government published a tourism promotion documentary Tuesday
featuring the life of a legendary warlord who played a historic role in the
turbulent China of the 1930s and who was kept under house arrest in this
northern Taiwan county for over a decade.</P>
      <P>The film, titled The Ching Chuan Dream, was screened during a regular meeting of
county officials  at the county government headquarters. Hsinchu Magistrate Chen
Yung-chin said the film will be shown at Chang's home on Chingchuan in Wufeng
township, which is now being reconstructed.</P>
      <P>After Beijing displayed a positive attitude toward Taiwan's proposals on weekend
cross Taiwan-Strait charter flights and further opening of Taiwan to Chinese
tourists, Chen instructed that the reconstruction of Chang's former residence be
stepped up. The residence of the "Young Marshall, " as Chang was known, was
swept away by a typhoon in 1962.</P>
      <P>The film records Chang's life in Chingchuan from 1946 to 1960, including the
love story of the legendary figure and his mistress, who later became his wife.
Chen said the film will be broadcast at Chang's home as an attraction to
visitors from China.</P>
      <P>Chen said he expects the house and the story will be one of the county's unique
tourism resources in attracting Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>Chang, the son of Chinese warlord Chang Tso-lin, was born in 1901. He played a
key role in the kidnapping of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in 1936 in an
attempt to persuade the latter to go all-out against Japanese aggression.</P>
      <P>He was persuaded by Chiang to give up his attempt and submit himself to the
Nanjing-based Nationalist government for discipline. Chang escorted Chiang to
Nanjing two weeks later, ending the so-called Xian Incident.</P>
      <P>He was then put under house arrest for nearly half a century after moving to
Taiwan along with the ROC government in 1949.</P>
      <P>He was granted relative freedom of movement in Taiwan in 1988 by then-President
Lee Teng-hui and was finally allowed to move to Honolulu in 1993, where he died
in 2001.</P>

      <P>Local industries are looking forward to the incoming administration, whose
commitment toward closer ties with China could help Taiwanese industries'
efforts to compete in the global market, Chinese National Federation of
Industries (CNFI) Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing industry leaders at a CNFI conference, Chen expressed confidence in
the policies promised by the new Cabinet, citing the incoming government's 12
major construction projects,  industry renovation and global connection as key
measures that could make a difference to local industries.</P>
      <P>"Improvements in cross-Taiwan Strait relations -- including direct cross-strait
chartered flights, the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists, and relaxing
restrictions that currently limit local investment in China to 40 percent of a
company's total capital -- will be sure to help boost Taiwan's private sector in
the face of the highly competitive global market," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen  said  the association  will steer  the 149 industry associations  under
its umbrella to collaborate  with the new government in order to further develop
the domestic economy, while urging the incoming Cabinet to keep President-elect
Ma Ying-jeou's campaign promises.</P>
      <P>He also urged the country to join the East Asian Free Trade Agreement (EAFTA)
and to form economic zones with China to facilitate the relocation of local
businesses to other parts of the world's economies.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters prior to his opening speech at the conference, Chen
praised the Boao Forum for Asia, on the sidelines of which Vice President-elect
Vincent Siew and Chinese President Hu Jintao held a landmark meeting to discuss
bilateral economic issues.</P>
      <P>"The meeting is a great start for a revival of cross-strait business
development, " he said, adding that it shows the new government's  determination
to  improve  China-based  Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>Chen also welcomed a recent plan by the Central Bank of the Republic of China to
open currency exchanges between the Chinese yuan and the new Taiwan dollar,
saying it is something that should have been done many years ago.</P>
      <P>"Now, currency exchanges across the strait will no longer have to rely on
underground trading," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen, a former vice commissioner of the Council of Agriculture, recently
attended a meeting with Ma and various top industry leaders, and there has been
speculation that he is a possible candidate to join the new Cabinet as head of
the COA.</P>
      <P>He declined to comment on the rumor, but pointed out two things the new
administration hopes to achieve to improve the domestic business environment.</P>
      <P>"Major construction projects must be undertaken in a timely fashion so that
industry can seize business opportunities, " he said, adding that to encourage
local investment, the government should reduce the tax burden on enterprises.</P>
      <P>"It is not a policy with an aim of catering to the rich but an action that would
improve the wealth of the country overall, " he said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) will provide a special train service to
transport music fans between Taipei and Taichung for an April 19 concert by
Italian singer Andrea Bocelli, TRA officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The decision not only shows the popularity in Taiwan of Bocelli -- a renowned
blind vocalist born in Lajatico near the Italian city of Pisa -- it has also
earned the TRA a reputation as a supporter of culture, according to Wang Hu-chen
of the TRA's Department of Transport.</P>
      <P>Two express trains will depart from the Taipei Railway Station at 3: 08 p.m. and
3: 40 p.m., respectively, on the day of the concert, while passengers wishing to
return from the central city to the north after the concert can catch trains at
11:21 p.m. and 11:40 p.m.</P>
      <P>The  concert,  which  will  be  staged  in  the  Taichung Intercontinental
Baseball Stadium (TIBS) in Taichung City, some 150 km south of Taipei, is
Bocelli's first in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that half of the tickets have been bought in Taipei, Wang said that "the
TRA therefore decided to provide the Taipei fans with the special services so
they can return home more conveniently."</P>
      <P>"This is the first time the TRA has offered such a program for music fans," Wang
noted, promising that "the TRA will introduce other additional services to meet

      <P>The Battery Dance Company, a renowned modern dance troupe based in New York
City, will stage a performance in the central city of Taichung May 1, the
Cultural Affairs Bureau of the Taichung city government announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The performance, titled Moving Spirit, will take place in Taichung City's Chung
Shan Hall at 7:30 p.m. From April 17, the bureau will distribute free tickets,
with each applicant limited to a maximum of four tickets.</P>
      <P>The performance is sponsored by the Taichung city government and the American
Institute (AIT) in Taiwan -- the de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to staging its own dance pieces, the troupe will help an 18-member
aboriginal dance troupe of Taichung County's Szu Chen Junior High School present
a 10-minute work created by the students themselves.</P>
      <P>The troupe will also conduct four master classes April 29-30 to connect with
young dancers in Taichung and Pingtung counties.</P>
      <P>This will be the Battery Dance Company's second visit to Taiwan. The troupe had
a six-day stay in Taiwan in October 2006, during which its founder and artistic
director, Jonathan Hollander, along with his dancers, conducted 11 master
classes and workshops and worked with dancers from the Cloud Gate Dance Theater,
Taiwan's most prestigious dance troupe.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is one of six legs of the Battery Dance Company's tour of Asia, which
began in South Korea April 12 and will take the troupe to Laos, Myanmar and
Mongolia before finishing up in Beijing May 10.</P>
      <P>According to a news release posted on the company's Web site, the Asian tour
will see six dancers presenting four pieces: I'll take you there (2006) , Shell
Games (2005) , Notebooks (2003) and Moonbeam (1992) -- all choreographed by
Hollander, who founded the troupe in 1976. Moonbeam, a work of unusual peace,
serenity and austere romanticism, was originally premiered as a duet in India in
1992, but has been expanded into a piece for six dancers.</P>
      <P>The company has produced nearly 100 original works, characterized by
choreography and music inspired by worldwide sources, with the musical
accompaniment often performed live.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, the troupe has developed extensive cultural exchange
programs with dancers and musicians in East and South Asia, Eastern and Central
Europe, Scandinavia, North Africa, the Middle East, Australia and the Caribbean.</P>

      <P>Some legislators suggested Tuesday to Winston Dang, minister of the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) , that the target for greenhouse
gas reduction should be included in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act (GGRA)
draft rather than in separate regulations, to clearly establish Taiwan's goal of
reducing global warming.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan's target for reducing greenhouse gases is made part of the law, it
would help to enhance the country's image in the international community, " said
Kuomintang Legislator Wu Chih-yang during a review of the GGRA draft.</P>
      <P>In response, Dang said that he will respect the legislators' decision, adding
that Taiwan's actual target is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to the
2000 level by 2025.</P>
      <P>Another KMT legislator, Yang Li-hung, also suggested that the GGRA should be
enacted in line with other relevant legislation, such as the energy-related
laws.</P>
      <P>The GGRA was approved by the Executive Yuan in 2006 to create a legal basis for
the control of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taoyuan Magistrate Chu Li-lun called Tuesday for quick passage through the
legislature of a bill that would allow an upgrading of the Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, saying that Taiwan will suffer dwindling competitiveness
if the bill fails to pass soon.</P>
      <P>Chu made the call as the transportation and home affairs committees under the
Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting to screen the bill, which is aimed at
upgrading the status and functions of the country's main gateway.</P>
      <P>The bill would allow Taiwan to catch up with Japan and experience booming
development, and the whole country -- not just Taoyuan County -- would benefit
from it, according to Chu.</P>
      <P>In the future, development in such special zones as Taichung Port and
Chingchuankang Airport in central Taiwan's Taichung City will also take off, he
said.</P>
      <P>According to Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications Oliver F.L. Yu,
the bill also involves a project by the Taoyuan county government to establish a
Taoyuan aviation park on land adjacent to the airport that could house different
areas for eight businesses, including a special airport zone and a free trade
zone, among other foreign trade, taxation and customs operations.</P>
      <P>Chu told a news conference at the Legislative Yuan in October last year that the
30-year-old airport, formerly known as the Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport, needs to sharpen its competitiveness, as its ranking has dropped to
85th place among the world's 136 major airports.</P>
      <P>The airport must be made into a legally and professionally incorporated compound
comprising a multinational business operations hub, a free trade zone,
warehousing and distribution facilities, exhibition centers, tourism hotels,
shopping malls and a high-tech science park, so as to avoid being shunted aside
and so that it can again become globally competitive, Chu said.</P>
      <P>Driven by that goal, Chu said, he crafted a program to create the aviation park,
to be located on a 6,150-hectare plot, that could attract over NT$1.2 trillion
(US$37 billion) -worth of investment, creating an annual business revenue of at
least NT$600 billion and more than 80,000 jobs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Over 90% of plastic bags not recycled: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan recycled 2.66 billion, or 9,319 tons, of plastic bags via the garbage
collection system from May 2006 to March this year,  but the performance still
has room for improvement as the annual recycling rate is less than 10 percent,
an Environmental Protection Administration (EAP) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ho Shun-chin,  director-general of the Department of Waste Management under the
EPA, said Taiwanese people consume about 18 billion plastic bags every year,
with each person using more than two plastic bags every day on average.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is the first country to collect plastic bags through the national
garbage collection system," Ho added.</P>
      <P>The plastic bag recycling service started two years ago on a trial basis in 14
counties and cities, with the recycling volume reaching about 3,000 tons before
the service was formalized in all 25 counties and cities last April.</P>
      <P>About 80 percent of Taiwan's 319 townships now provide a plastic bag recycling
service, Ho went on.</P>
      <P>Taiwan implemented a partial ban in 2003 that prohibits department stores,
supermarkets, convenience stores and wholesalers from providing free plastic
bags to customers, Ho said, adding that the annual national consumption of
plastic bags was about 20 billion before the ban.</P>
      <P>However, she added that the ban does not apply to all plastic bag sources, as
sellers at traditional markets and street vendors that provide free plastic bags
often are not included on the control list.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she pointed out that because plastic bag recycling is not yet a
mandated regulation, there are no penalties for those who dump recyclable
plastic bags along with their garbage.</P>
      <P>The public is encouraged to recycle bags made of materials such as polypropylene
(PP) and polyethylene (PE) ,  which are both non-degradable and can be
reprocessed into such items as plant pots or new bags, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Some townships accept both clean and stained plastic bags for recycling, while
some only accept clean ones because they do not have the equipment for cleaning
dirty bags before reprocessing, Ho went on.</P>
      <P>Other plastic bags, such as those made of complex materials including foil and
anti-static bags for protecting computers or monitors, cannot be recycled and
have to be dumped, Ho continued.</P>
      <P>She further pointed out that some packaging manufacturers put recycling  labels
on  non-recyclable   products,   causing misunderstandings between the public
and garbage-sorting teams.</P>
      <P>Once again, though, the Waste Disposable Act fails to stipulate any penalties
for violators, she said.</P>

      <P>AOL, a U.S.-based Web services provider formerly known as America Online,
launched a Chinese-language portal site in Taiwan Monday, the company said in a
news release.</P>
      <P>The new site, the second in Asia after one in India, is part of the company's
efforts to expand its global presence from the current 18 portals to an
estimated 30 by the end of 2008, the statement said.</P>
      <P>"People in Taiwan are among the world's most sophisticated Internet users, "
said Maneesh Dhir, executive vice president of AOL International, in the
statement.</P>
      <P>Prior to the launch of the site, AOL conducted a two-year assessment of the
Taiwan market, said Norman Koo, vice president and general manager for Greater
China of AOL.</P>
      <P>"The launch of AOL.tw is just the beginning of an ongoing effort to provide
consumers in Taiwan with the services and content they want," he added.</P>
      <P>Like other major portal sites in Taiwan provided by Google and Yahoo, AOL.tw
offers a wide range of free content and services, including  free e-mail with
unlimited  storage and an instant messenger.</P>
      <P>To offer Chinese-language news updates, AOL.tw has joined forces with udn.com, a
news Web site operated by United Daily News, a major Chinese-language daily
based in Taipei, and Hong Kong-based Phoenix New Media.</P>
      <P>In addition, AOL is working with Hewlett-Packard Co., the world's biggest PC
maker, to deliver a co-branded local language portal and search solution for HP
users in Taiwan in the coming weeks, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>However, industry watchers have been quoted in the DIGITIMES -- a bilingual
information technology news provider -- as saying that AOL entered the Taiwan
market "too late and is expected to face intense competition."</P>
      <P>But Koo said he believes there is still room for AOL in Taiwan because local
Internet users have diverse demands.</P>
      <P>As of February, Yahoo! Kimo was the largest Web portal in Taiwan, followed by
HiNet, Google, Microsoft MSN, PChome Online and Yam, according to survey
statistics cited by DIGITIMES.</P>
      <P>In the United States, AOL has a market share of 4 percent, a far smaller
percentage compared with other search engines -- Google with 50 percent and
Yahoo with 20 percent, according to statistics released by the Virginia-based
researcher ComScore Inc. in February.</P>
      <P>The launch of the Taiwan portal also came at a time when AOL is reportedly
negotiating with Yahoo over a possible merger after Yahoo rejected a US$44.6
billion takeover offer from Microsoft Corp.</P>
      <P>AOL is a majority-owned subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. AOL and its subsidiaries
have operations in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Asia.</P>

      <P>Health workers told a news conference Tuesday that they located the woman
through one of her friends and took her to the center for a second blood test to
double-check whether she had really contracted HIV.</P>
      <P>However, while medical personnel were preparing to administer the test, the
unidentified woman fled.</P>
      <P>According to the public health center, the woman used a health insurance card
belonging to her friend, a 30-year-old Vietnamese woman living in the
northeastern city of Keelung, to pay for the initial blood test.</P>
      <P>When informed of the test result, the card owner was shocked, but soon recalled

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei city government officials said Tuesday that the city is prepared to serve
as an Asia-Pacific operations center if its Sungshan Airport can be used to
accommodate charter flights between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Since Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Kuomintang was elected president March 22,
many cities around Taiwan have been eager to promote their airports as possible
stops for the cross-strait charter flights Ma has promised to promote after he
assumes his post.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the promotion of Songshan Airport as a direct air-
link hub will not only lure Taiwanese businessmen operating in China to relocate
their headquarters to Taipei, but will also boost Taipei's potential as a
regional operations hub.</P>
      <P>In addition to promoting  Songshan  Airport as a stop on cross-strait charter
routes, "the Taipei city government will also give priority to strengthening the
information,  medical care, conferencing, culture and gourmet food industries in
order to create an excellent investment environment," the officials added.</P>

      <P>The 28 members of Uganda's Watoto Children's Choir currently touring Taiwan
spent a half-day Tuesday shopping in a hypermarket in the central city of
Taichung, and apparently enjoyed the experience.</P>
      <P>The children and their adult leaders, each armed with NT$1,000 (US$33) -- a gift
from the Tatun Chapter of the Rotary Club -- roamed the store, buying mostly
clothing, socks and sports shoes. They also received a variety of gifts from the
hypermarket management.</P>
      <P>The choir was treated to a steak lunch at a restaurant before spending the
afternoon at the National Museum of Natural Science in Taichung.</P>
      <P>The Ugandan children will perform two concerts in Taichung April 20 as part of
the choir's Taiwan tour that began late last month.</P>
      <P>The two Taichung concerts, sponsored by a local community service association,
will take place at 2:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. in the city's Chungshan Hall. Tickets
are free, with a maximum allocation of four tickets per person.</P>
      <P>The Watoto Children's Choir has already given eight "Concerts of Hope" in major
cities since its arrival March 28, including three in Taipei and one each in
Changhua, Hsinchu, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Yilan under the sponsorship of World
Vision Taiwan, a Christian relief organization dedicated to helping
underprivileged  children and families.</P>
      <P>This is the choir's second visit to Taiwan. During its last visit in 2006, the
children moved audiences with their songs and the tour was a resounding success,
with considerable funds raised.</P>
      <P>The choir's members are all orphans aged between 6 and 13. Their tour of Taiwan
is intended to increase awareness about the AIDS crisis in Africa and raise
funds for a missionary program -- the Watoto Child Care Ministries -- that helps
AIDS orphans in Uganda.</P>
      <P>About 2 million in Uganda are afflicted with AIDS and most of the 1,600 children
in the care of the ministries have lost their parents to the disease.</P>
      <P>Watoto, the name of the village in Uganda from which the choir takes its name
and from where the children come, means "children" in Swahili, one of the most
widely spoken languages in East Africa.</P>

      <P>The main goal of the trip is to convey the party's appreciation to Taiwanese

      <P>The report said Chiang will visit China on April 20 and if he has the chance, he
will meet with his possible counterpart Chen Yunlin, who has been reported to
take over the post of chairman of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>However, Chiang said Tuesday that he is not eager to meet Chen now. Chen
currently heads China's Taiwan Affairs Office.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that many important issues need to be addressed through talks

    <HEADLINE>Indoor air quality is three times worse than outdoor: German expert</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The air quality of a non-smoking office is three times worse than the quality of
outdoor air, a Taipei-based German environmental expert said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Many modern construction materials contain chemicals that are harmful to human
health and so do many office equipment, said Andreas Gursch, deputy director of
the Germany Trade Office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Gursch, an expert on waste management and resource recycling, made the remarks
after posing the question -- "Is your office killing you? " -- to employees of
the Taipei county government in a keynote speech on German green buildings and
renewable energies.</P>
      <P>Citing survey results, Gursch said that a TV set contains more than 4,000 types
of chemicals.</P>
      <P>He suggested the county government rent, rather than buy, durable office goods
so that it can return the goods to the company for upgrading or replacement when
they are too old.</P>
      <P>By doing this, waste could be minimized, Gursch said.</P>
      <P>On Taipei county's government building, a fully enclosed one that was recently
criticized by Deputy County Magistrate Lee Hung-yuan as very environmentally
unfriendly, Gursch said that a building should be designed or built as eco-
friendly as a tree.</P>
      <P>In addition, Gursch said that only products that can always be recycled are
called "renewable resources, " not those that can be recycled just once, which
he stressed is a concept that needs to be established in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As an example of the concept, Gursch said that people should recycle daily and
to also recycle kitchen waste.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Gursch praised Taiwan for doing a good job in recycling and said
young Taiwanese children have a keen sense of environmental awareness. But he
added that Taiwan's adults need to work harder.</P>
      <P>In 2006, Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) kicked off a
countrywide recycling campaign requiring local residents to sort household waste
into three categories: recyclable resources, kitchen waste and garbage.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's total recycling rate has reached some 36 percent, a percentage that the
EPA said is higher than that of the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>Gursch further predicted that agriculture will be the focus of the next eco-
revolution, saying that local farmers' associations should start to increase
local farmers's eco-friendly awareness.</P>
      <P>Gursch, who has dedicated himself to protecting the environment in Taiwan over
the last 16 years, said that Taiwan has the responsibility to cut carbon dioxide
emissions even though it is not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Forty bus lines serving remote areas of Taiwan have been suspended from the
beginning of this year due to their unprofitability, an official of the
Directorate General of Highways (DGH) under the Executive Yuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Director-General  Chen Chun-hsiung said the DGH has encouraged bus
companies to design new lines with integrated routes and more effective
operations  with the aim of reducing the inconvenience caused by the suspension
to residents living in remote areas.</P>
      <P>He added that local governments and motor vehicle offices in the affected areas
have provided a total of 250 possible new lines to be examined by a bus company
committee April 25.</P>
      <P>Earlier, a suggestion by the DGH to run smaller buses on existing lines to save
on fuel costs was rejected when the bus companies said the ceiling of government
subsidies for buying the buses -- 45 percent of the purchase amount -- means the
companies would fail to cover their operating costs, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that 570 of the 1,199 bus lines under DGH jurisdiction are
operated with government subsidies, including the 40 suspended lines.</P>
      <P>The companies involved include the Hsinchu Transportation Co., Hsingnan Bus,
Miaoli Bus, Kaohsiung Transportation Co., Taichung Bus and Kuokuang Motor
Transport Co.</P>
      <P>The government provides about NT$720 million (US$23.68 million) in subsidies,
which is equal to 80 percent of the amount applied for by the industry, to help
cover their losses, Chen said, adding that the DGH will seek additional budget
to make up the remaining 20 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Over 90% of plastic bags not recycled: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 15 (CNA)
04/16/08  10:32:14
(By Ruth Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan recycled 2.66 billion, or 9,319 tons, of plastic bags via the garbage
collection system from May 2006 to March this year,  but the performance still
has room for improvement as the annual recycling rate is less than 10 percent,
an Environmental Protection Administration (EAP) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ho Shun-chin,  director-general of the Department of Waste Management under the
EPA, said Taiwanese people consume about 18 billion plastic bags every year,
with each person using more than two plastic bags every day on average.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is the first country to collect plastic bags through the national
garbage collection system," Ho added.</P>
      <P>The plastic bag recycling service started two years ago on a trial basis in 14
counties and cities, with the recycling volume reaching about 3,000 tons before
the service was formalized in all 25 counties and cities last April.</P>
      <P>About 80 percent of Taiwan's 319 townships now provide a plastic bag recycling
service, Ho went on.</P>
      <P>Taiwan implemented a partial ban in 2003 that prohibits department stores,
supermarkets, convenience stores and wholesalers from providing free plastic
bags to customers, Ho said, adding that the annual national consumption of
plastic bags was about 20 billion before the ban.</P>
      <P>However, she added that the ban does not apply to all plastic bag sources, as
sellers at traditional markets and street vendors that provide free plastic bags
often are not included on the control list.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she pointed out that because plastic bag recycling is not yet a
mandated regulation, there are no penalties for those who dump recyclable
plastic bags along with their garbage.</P>
      <P>The public is encouraged to recycle bags made of materials such as polypropylene
(PP) and polyethylene (PE) ,  which are both non-degradable and can be
reprocessed into such items as plant pots or new bags, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Some townships accept both clean and stained plastic bags for recycling, while
some only accept clean ones because they do not have the equipment for cleaning
dirty bags before reprocessing, Ho went on.</P>
      <P>Other plastic bags, such as those made of complex materials including foil and
anti-static bags for protecting computers or monitors, cannot be recycled and
have to be dumped, Ho continued.</P>
      <P>She further pointed out that some packaging manufacturers put recycling  labels
on  non-recyclable   products,   causing misunderstandings between the public
and garbage-sorting teams.</P>
      <P>Once again, though, the Waste Disposable Act fails to stipulate any penalties
for violators, she said.</P>

      <P>AOL, a U.S.-based Web services provider formerly known as America Online,
launched a Chinese-language portal site in Taiwan Monday, the company said in a
news release.</P>
      <P>The new site, the second in Asia after one in India, is part of the company's
efforts to expand its global presence from the current 18 portals to an
estimated 30 by the end of 2008, the statement said.</P>
      <P>"People in Taiwan are among the world's most sophisticated Internet users, "
said Maneesh Dhir, executive vice president of AOL International, in the
statement.</P>
      <P>Prior to the launch of the site, AOL conducted a two-year assessment of the
Taiwan market, said Norman Koo, vice president and general manager for Greater
China of AOL.</P>
      <P>"The launch of AOL.tw is just the beginning of an ongoing effort to provide
consumers in Taiwan with the services and content they want," he added.</P>
      <P>Like other major portal sites in Taiwan provided by Google and Yahoo, AOL.tw
offers a wide range of free content and services, including  free e-mail with
unlimited  storage and an instant messenger.</P>
      <P>To offer Chinese-language news updates, AOL.tw has joined forces with udn.com, a
news Web site operated by United Daily News, a major Chinese-language daily
based in Taipei, and Hong Kong-based Phoenix New Media.</P>
      <P>In addition, AOL is working with Hewlett-Packard Co., the world's biggest PC
maker, to deliver a co-branded local language portal and search solution for HP
users in Taiwan in the coming weeks, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>However, industry watchers have been quoted in the DIGITIMES -- a bilingual
information technology news provider -- as saying that AOL entered the Taiwan
market "too late and is expected to face intense competition."</P>
      <P>But Koo said he believes there is still room for AOL in Taiwan because local
Internet users have diverse demands.</P>
      <P>As of February, Yahoo! Kimo was the largest Web portal in Taiwan, followed by
HiNet, Google, Microsoft MSN, PChome Online and Yam, according to survey
statistics cited by DIGITIMES.</P>
      <P>In the United States, AOL has a market share of 4 percent, a far smaller
percentage compared with other search engines -- Google with 50 percent and
Yahoo with 20 percent, according to statistics released by the Virginia-based
researcher ComScore Inc. in February.</P>
      <P>The launch of the Taiwan portal also came at a time when AOL is reportedly
negotiating with Yahoo over a possible merger after Yahoo rejected a US$44.6
billion takeover offer from Microsoft Corp.</P>
      <P>AOL is a majority-owned subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. AOL and its subsidiaries
have operations in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Asia.</P>

      <P>The air quality of a non-smoking office is three times worse than the quality of

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan records nine more severe enteroviral infections</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
04/16/08  12:32:36
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed Tuesday nine more cases of
severe enteroviral infection, bringing to 36 the total number of such incidents
so far this year.</P>
      <P>Of these 36 children who developed severe complications from the infection, 16
contracted the virus from their elder siblings who often show only mild symptoms
from the infection, according to CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao.</P>
      <P>In one of the latest of these cases, a three-year-old boy in the southern city
of Tainan was diagnosed early this month with severe enteroviral infection, and
the source of infection was traced to his six-year-old brother and five-year-old
sister,  who were first infected but had only mild illness, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Experts have said that those who contract the virus from other patients and
those under the age of 4 are particularly vulnerable to developing serious
enteroviral symptoms.</P>
      <P>Referring to data collected from the Department of Health's "sentinel physician
active reporting system," Chou said 2.26 in every 1,000 persons making medical
visits last week were infected with enterovirus, up significantly from 1.97 in
every 1,000 persons in the previous week.</P>
      <P>Over the past month, Chou continued, as many as 39 percent of enterovirus cases
tested by CDC-contracted laboratories have been identified as enterovirus type
71 (E71) -- the deadliest type of enterovirus.</P>
      <P>While 43 percent of children aged 5 and under in Taiwan are not immune to E71,
as many as 90 of those aged 4 and under lack any immunity to E71, according to
the CDC.</P>
      <P>Enteroviruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can be
serious, especially in infants.</P>
      <P>In 1988, Taiwan experienced a severe outbreak of E71, with 405 children
infected, 78 of whom died.</P>
      <P>Another E71 outbreak in 2005 saw 145 children infected, 15 of whom died.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will pursue a comprehensive economic cooperation pact with China and at
the same time try to seal free trade agreements (FTAs)  with other countries,
including Singapore, President-elect Ma Ying-jeou said in interviews published
here Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the interview in Taipei Tuesday with The Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao, Ma,
who is slated to be inaugurated May 20, said Taiwan will seek to enter into a
comprehensive economic cooperation pact with China and seal FTAs with other
countries around Asia.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he hoped FTA talks between Taiwan and the city state will be
restarted as soon as possible to pave the way for Taiwan to seal similar
agreements with other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members.</P>
      <P>"As long as Singapore agrees, we should start as soon as possible, " Ma said in
interviews that were published on prominent pages of the two dailies.</P>
      <P>Talks started soon after President Chen Shui-bian was elected in 2000, but broke
off soon after, partly under pressure from China and partly because of a dispute
over how to refer to Taiwan, Ma told the The Straits Times.</P>
      <P>Ma said eased cross-Taiwan Strait relations were critical to the resumption of
Taiwan-Singapore FTA talks.</P>
      <P>"We certainly hope we can achieve some results in our relations with the
mainland so that Singapore can rest assured that our FTA negotiations will not
hurt its relations with the mainland, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president-elect asserted that so long as Taiwan is flexible and pragmatic on
the title issue when engaging in talks with Singapore, obstructions will be
minimized.</P>
      <P>"We can accept any other names as long as they are feasible and won't undermine
Taiwan's dignity. Substance is more important than formality," Ma told The
Straits Times.</P>
      <P>For years, Ma has advocated that Taiwan should be accepted as the the fourth
partner of dialogue in the ASEAN Plus Three (China, Japan and South Korea)
group.</P>
      <P>Responding to Ma's call, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry issue a
statement Wednesday, saying that Singapore has yet to be approached officially
by the Ma administration on the FTA</P>
      <P>Also in a statement, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said there will be
many opportunities for Taiwan and Singapore to enhance bilateral economic
cooperation if cross-Strait relations improve and economic affairs are not
politicized.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Ma also mentioned that Taiwan hopes to accelerate progress on
FTA talks with the United States.</P>
      <P>"I won't say I'm optimistic about sealing FTAs with other countries. But I think
all nations will welcome a peaceful and not troublemaking Taiwan," he said.</P>

their investigation into President Chen's handling of the special "state affairs
fund" budgeted for his discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Next Magazine, a tabloid weekly published by Apple Daily, reported Wednesday

country in relation to a case in which he and his wife allegedly pocketed cash
from the fund drawn with receipts provided by people other than the first

      <P>His wife, Wu Shu-chen, was indicted on corruption charges and prosecutors said
they had enough evidence to charge Chen but could not because he enjoyed

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's tourism industry prepared for opening to Chinese tourists</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's travel agencies are capable of providing safe, quality tours to 10,000
Chinese tourists a day, Yao Ta-kuang, chairman of the Travel Agent Association
of R.O.C., Taiwan (TAA), asserted Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Since 2002, the industry has accommodated 800,000 tourists from China, who came
to visit or were transiting to other destinations, and is well-aware of the
potential risks and safety issues involved," Yao said at a public hearing at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Yao said the association, which is responsible for tour group registration to
protect the rights of inbound tourists, imposes strict conditions  on details
like charter bus standards  and restaurant reservations before handing out
permission to an agency to lead an inbound group.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou campaigned on opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists.
Under the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party administration, arrivals were
to be limited to 1,000 visitors a day, but Ma has suggested that number could
increase to between 3,000 to 10,000 per day once an agreement with China has
been ironed out.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) and the Tourism Bureau raised
concerns that admitting too many Chinese tourists too quickly could strain their
operations and lead the potential inflow of illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>But Yao was confident that the travel association's screening system could
prevent some of the problems, and he insisted tourism could be amajor force in
reviving cross-Taiwan Strait economic exchanges and spurring economic growth at
home.</P>
      <P>He estimated Chinese tourists could directly inject NT$66 billion into Taiwan's
economy, which would generate 2.7 times that amount in terms of overall social
and economic benefit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's biggest airline, China Airlines Ltd. (CAL), also said it was ready for
the opening, expected to be launched in July, saying it would fly to more
destinations in both Taiwan and China once the policy was in place.</P>
      <P>"CAL has more than 10 years of experience transporting passengers across the
Taiwan Strait, and we plan to establish more destinations to cater to the
increasing number of cross-strait passengers, " said CAL President Ringo Chao.</P>
      <P>He said the carrier hopes to connect Taipei Taoyuan, Taichung and Kaohsiung in
Taiwan and Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Xiamen in China, which Chao saw as
the cities that attract the most Taiwanese businessmen.</P>
      <P>He also said CAL is full-prepared for cross-strait direct chartered flights on
weekends that are expected to begin prior in July.</P>
      <P>Concerned about a large influx of Chinese tourists, the Ministry of the
Interior's National Immigration Agency said it had measures in place to deter
illegal immigration.</P>
      <P>"The bureau imposes a NT$200,000 fine on tour agencies for every tourist that
does not leave the country with the rest of the group as scheduled, " said Wu
Shen-yan, a senior official with the NIA.</P>
      <P>According to the agency, 119 Chinese tourists have failed to abide by the
restriction since 2002, when the government withdrew the ban on inbound Chinese
tourists on a limited basis. Ninety-four of them have been caught and returned
to China.</P>
      <P>Wu also suggested that the Travel Agency Association hire subcontractors to
handle inbound tourism services on behalf of his agency, saying the government
may not have enough manpower to handle the projected 3,000 tourists per day.</P>
      <P>The hearing also included voices from local scholars, who generally backed the
new policy but warned that quantity could not undermine the quality of the
tours.</P>
      <P>"The tour should provide symbolic values such as cultural diversity to impress
the visitors, "said Jimmy C. Yung, the president of Kaohsiung Hospitality
College.</P>
      <P>Yung called for an in-depth cultural exchange between Taiwan and China and
advised the local tour industry to arrange a variety of sights around the island
to showcase Taiwan's multidimensional faces.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers who chaired the hearing said the discussion, by forging a consensus
among local industry, academia and the government, could help the incoming
cabinet negotiate with China regarding on tourism issues.</P>

      <P>State-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) will make a confidential report to a
legislative committee on its investment in a power plant in Honduras, Taipower
officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials were responding to a request by legislators who expressed worries
that Taipower could incur severe losses on its investment plan in Patuca
hydroelectric project in the Central American country.</P>
      <P>The legislators said that Taipower's finances have been weakened by a government
freeze on electricity rate, and that it would have to shoulder heavy interest
payments if it needed to borrow money for the investment.</P>
      <P>According to the legislators, Taipower passed the NT$345.88 million (US$11.57
million) investment plan in an internal meeting March 5 and the plan will begin
this year, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) initially footing the
bill.</P>
      <P>As Taipower has not appropriated funds for the investment project and
legislators were unable to screen the budgets, they had asked for a closed-door
report by the Taipower.</P>
      <P>Taipower Chairman Edward K. M. Chen said recently that the MOFA will be
responsible for any losses in the firm's investment plan.</P>
      <P>The investment plan forms part of a package of foreign aid that President  Chen

      <P>Taiwanese financial institutions will be allowed only to buy Chinese yuan in
exchange for new Taiwan dollars as a "first stage" measure if exchange  services
between the currencies of Taiwan and China are launched in Taiwan proper in
July, a government spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey quoted Perng Fai-nan, governor of the
Central Bank of the Republic of China (CBC) , as saying that the central bank
plans to adopt a two-stage approach in introducing full exchange services
between the Chinese yuan and the new Taiwan dollar in Taiwan proper, in
accordance with requests by opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislators.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the central bank will only allow financial institutions to
buy Chinese yuan in exchange for new Taiwan dollars, as local banks will have
zero or little stock of the Chinese currency available when Taiwan first allows
such exchanges, Shieh quoted Perng as saying.</P>
      <P>In the second stage, if the central bank is confident of a stable supply of yuan
-- which could be provided by inbound tourists from China -- it will permit
financial institutions to both buy and sell the Chinese currency, Shieh added.</P>
      <P>Between the two stages, he noted, banking institutions on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait will consult each other on how to tackle other technical issues
related to the opening.</P>
      <P>Shieh did not exclude the possibility that the first stage could take place
prior to the inauguration of the new Kuomintang (KMT) administration May 20,
although he pointed out that regulations will need to be revised before any
currency exchange system can take effect.</P>
      <P>Since the Chinese yuan will have to be obtained mainly from Chinese tourists
coming to Taiwan, the two-stage opening measure is necessary as Taiwanese
citizens make some 4 million visits to China each year, compared to only some 1
million Chinese tourists who will be allowed to visit Taiwan each year if Taiwan
decides to allow entry to a maximum of 3,000 Chinese tourists a day after the
KMT administration takes office, Shieh added.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus proposed recently that Taiwan should launch exchange
facilities for the two currencies even before relevant regulations are amended
and a cross-strait clearance and settlement mechanism is established.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou has committed to allowing free exchange of the
Chinese yuan in Taiwan. Individuals have been allowed to exchange up to 20,000
yuan on the Taiwan-controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu, which lie just off
China's southeastern coast, since October 2005.</P>
      <P>But with an agreement on allowing entry of Chinese tourists to Taiwan expected
to be struck after the new government takes office, the issue of exchange
services on Taiwan proper has become more pressing.</P>

to make an emergency landing the day before were new, while the one tire that
did not burst had recently been repaired, the Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The aircraft was taking off from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in the
north for Kaohsiung in the south Tuesday morning when the accident occurred. The
pilot detected abnormalities shortly after takeoff and informed air traffic
controllers, who in turn informed the pilot that tire fragments had been
discovered on the runway.</P>
      <P>While the plane was preparing for landing in Kaohsiung, air traffic controllers
there noticed that one of the tires had burst. During landing, two more of the
tires burst due to pressure imbalances caused by the blown tire.</P>
      <P>CAA  Deputy  Director  Lin Hsin-teh  said  Wednesday  that investigations
revealed that besides fragments of the plane's outer skin and tire fragments, no
other debris was found on the runway at Taoyuan International Airport.</P>

31, Lin said the CAA is investigating how an almost brand new tire could have
burst upon takeoff.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ferry companies offering services on the "mini three links" route are set to
raise their ticket prices from Friday by nearly 10 percent due to increasing
fuel costs.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the ferry companies Chinhsia, Darong and Chinan said they
have received approval from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to
increase their ticket prices from NT$600 (US$20) for a one-way trip to NT$650.</P>
      <P>The one exception is the "Eastern Star" ferry, whose ticket prices will remain
unchanged for the time being. The operator of the ferry said it was holding
fares steady to "celebrate Ma Ying-jeou and Vincent Siew's election as president
and vice president."</P>
      <P>The ferry operators said they are increasing their ticket prices to deal with
rising operating costs resulting from surging fuel prices.</P>
      <P>They also noted that with the recent appreciation of the Chinese yuan, ticket
prices on Chinese-operated ferries are now equivalent to about NT$650 for a one-
way trip.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" refers to direct postal, transportation and trade links
between the Chinese cities of Xiamn, Mawei and Quanzhou in Fujian province and
the Taiwan-controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu that lie just off the Chinese
coast.</P>

      <P>Panama's first lady Vivian Fernandez de Torrijos extended her gratitude Tuesday
to Taiwan for its contributions to several social welfare programs in Panama,
including the construction of elementary schools and water conduits.</P>
      <P>The Panamanian first lady expressed her thanks at a ceremony at the Presidential
Office during which Republic of China Ambassador Hou Ping-fu pledged funding for
the projects on behalf of the ROC government.</P>
      <P>Hou noted that the projects, which also include the construction of highways and
the expansion of a football stadium, are all examples of bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>Once the highways are completed, Hou said, the agricultural produce grown in
rural villages can be easily transported and sold in urban areas, while the
hospital that Taiwan promised to help build in eastern Panama Province will
greatly benefit the poor in that area.</P>
      <P>According to the first lady, President Martin Torrijos will have constructed 108
elementary schools in rural areas before he steps down in August next year,
which have improved significantly the level of education in poorer regions.</P>
      <P>As to the football stadium Rommel Fernandez in Panama City, which Taiwan has
helped to expand, First Vice President Samuel Lewis said that it will be able to
accommodate some 40,000 people, double the original 20,000 capacity, once the
construction work is completed and be suitable for international matches.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed Wednesday the first reading of a draft amendment
demanding that the whole course of any closed-door inter-party negotiations
within the legislature be video- and audio-recorded, and archived.</P>
      <P>The amendment was proposed to prevent possible under-the-table deals during
inter-party  negotiations,  said Legislator  Ting Shou-chung of the opposition
Kuomintang, who put forth the amendment bill.</P>
      <P>Under the existing  law governing  the Legislative  Yuan's operations, inter-
party negotiations at the legislature take place in private, with only the
conclusion required to be gazetted.</P>
      <P>Ting argued that it is common for proposals adopted at special legislative
committee meetings to be revised or overthrown in closed-door inter-party talks.
As the public has no way of knowing how or why the changes are made, they often
suspect that is the result of inter-party horse-trading, he said.</P>
      <P>To facilitate legislative efficiency,  the draft bill also requests a shortening
of the term of inter-party negotiations on a controversial bill from four months
to one month.</P>
      <P>Ting's proposal won the support of Legislator Wong Chin-chu of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the draft bill will now be sent for
review by the plenary session.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip William Lai said the party, which only controls 27
of the 113 seats at the legislature, is delighted to see the bill adopted, which
is part of efforts to push for more openness and transparency in legislative

      <P>Two more groves of a rare endemic beech tree species, known as Fagus hayatae,
were found in the northern part of the island, a natural resources professor has
said.</P>
      <P>The new stands of the relic-like trees were discovered in Yilan County in
northeastern Taiwan at the lowest altitude recorded on the island of the plant
species.</P>
      <P>One of the two stands was discovered on a 34-hectare area in the mountainous
Dabaishan area, at an altitude of 1,369 meters, while the other was found in the
mountainous Lancan area at 1,477 meters, occupying an area of 0. 34 hectares,
said Chen. Previous to the latest discovery, the trees had only been found in
Taiwan at altitudes of about 1,900 meters.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Tze-ying, professor of the Department of National Resources of
the I-Lan University, who discovered the forest in October 2006, the rare plants
can be traced back to the glacial age.</P>
      <P>The Fagus hayatae was first found in Taiwan in 1906 in Taipei County by Japanese
botanist Nariaki Konishi, and since 1992 has been listed in the Cultural
Heritage Preservation Law as a rare and precious plant.</P>
      <P>"By observing these beeches, we can see the effects of the global warming, "
said Chen, adding that the trees were originally found at low altitudes during
the last glacial period in Taiwan -- about 15,000-20,000 years ago-- but with
the rise in global temperatures due to climate change,  the species was later
found only in high-altitude areas.</P>
      <P>"If global warming continues, several groves of the beech trees in Taiwan, which
are already on the mountaintops, will have no more room for retreat, " Chen
warned.</P>
      <P>He noted that the biggest beech forest in the Tongshan areas in Yilan County,
which occupies 1,154 hectares, is under the threat.</P>
      <P>In order to protect the rare tree species, the Forestry Bureau launched a three-
year plan aimed at monitoring the biological diversity in beech forests and
preserving their genes.</P>
      <P>Asked how extinction of the beeches on th island could be prevented, Chen said
that "designating forest reserves is only one of ways -- the best solution, of
course, is to slow down the effects of global warming."</P>
      <P>The 12 existing species of beeches worldwide are usually found in temperate
zones in the Northern Hemisphere -- Taiwan is at present the southernmost
habitat of the plant, a Forestry Bureau official said.</P>
      <P>A relic-like plant does not evolve, as most organisms do, with environmental
change over tens of million of years -- it moves to a more hospitable
environment when its habitat changes.</P>
      <P>The Forestry Bureau has made a beech pathway in the mountainous Taipingshan
areas in Yilan county, from which people can view the beech forest.</P>

      <P>To mark the approach of Earth Day on April 22, the Society of Wilderness (SOW) ,
a local environmental group, launched a coastal cleanup movement nationwide
Wednesday, urging people to take better care of Taiwan's polluted beaches.</P>
      <P>Of Taiwan's 1,316 km of coastline, about 724 km, or 55 percent, are occupied by
breakwaters, cement dikes or harbors, while the remainder is polluted to varying
degrees, SOW Secretary-General Shi Chun-rong warned at a press conference.</P>
      <P>The SOW called for people to join the organization's eight branches on a cleanup
of 13 areas of coastline and beaches April 20, he added.</P>
      <P>"But the cleanup movement alone is not enough; finding ways to reduce man-made
waste and leave nothing on the beaches are the real solutions, " said Zheng
Ming-xiu, a scholar of the Research Center for Biodiversity at Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Zheng also urged the public and the government to re-examine the policy on
coastal construction such as harbors and breakwaters, which he said are
excessive.</P>
      <P>According to the SOW, Taiwan has about 240 harbors, amounting to a harbor every
six kilometers on average.</P>
      <P>"We have to change  the deep-rooted  concept  that `man's determination  will
conquer  nature, '" he said,  adding that breakwaters, for example, destroy not
only the natural coastline, but also the ecological system.</P>
      <P>He noted as an example the finding that crabs living among breakwaters rather
than along natural coastlines lose their ability to reproduce.</P>
      <P>Earth Day was initiated in the United States in the 1970s with the aim of

      <P>Cakes containing excessive amounts of trans fatty acids (TFAs) pose a health
risk to the public, officials warned Wednesday amid increasing cake purchases in
celebration of Mother's Day, which falls on the second Sunday of May -- May 11
this year.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Hsiu-lian, deputy commissioner of the Department of Health
(DOH) under the Taipei city government, TFAs are unsaturated fats with trans-
isomer fatty acids that are manufactured by partially hydrogenating plant oils.</P>
      <P>Noting that consumption of TFAs increases the risk of coronary disease, Liu said
at an event promoting healthy diets for Mother's Day that "the DOH would like to
recommend high quality bakeries to consumers."</P>
      <P>The event, which attracted the participation of officials and bakeries from the
Taipei area, was organized by the DOH and the Taipei Bakery Association (TBA)
with the purpose of not only promoting healthy cakes but also showcasing the
creativity of Taiwanese bakers.</P>
      <P>"Mothers should enjoy cakes that are healthy and TFA-free, " Lin said, adding
that "the public can purchase cakes that meet TFA safety standards from bakeries
displaying an "OK" sign designed by the DOH."</P>
      <P>Following the suit of the European Union and the United States, both of which
regulate the use of TFA, Chiang Yu-mei, chief of the DOH's Food and Drug
Division, said that "since 2008, Taiwan has also requested that bakeries limit
the amount of TFA used in cakes to less than 2 percent."</P>
      <P>Chiang further expressed hope that the bakeries, as well as consumers, can both
better understand the drawbacks of excessive consumption of TFAs through the
event.</P>
      <P>Ellen Yin, chairman of the TBA, said that cakes made in Taiwan are very creative
with fantastic presentation and a fusion of European, Japanese and U.S. flavors,
adding that "choosing a good cake for mother is essential."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Security Council (NSC) on Wednesday described as regrettable
reports that alleged this year's computerized warfare simulation revolves around
a scenario of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou being assassinated before his May 20
inauguration.</P>
      <P>NSC officials said the reports by "Next" weekly magazine were "regrettable, "
and "irresponsible," adding that they were "distorted because they were
politically-motivated."</P>
      <P>The reports stated that the war games simulated a situation in which Taiwan was
thrown into turmoil after Ma's assassination and the Chinese government took the
opportunity to launch a blitz attack on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This year's war games are actually simulating a senario of China acquiring its
first aircraft carrier in 2020 and launching an all-out attack from off the east
coast of Taiwan, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said the war games are aimed at strengthening the capacity of
government agencies to deal with military crises and the ability to protect the
nation's infrastructure in a crisis.</P>
      <P>The simulation exercise is also aimed at testing decision-making among the heads
of relevant government agencies and verifying mechanisms for dealing with
crises, and related plans, they added.</P>
      <P>The officials said that this year's war games, scheduled for April 25-27, will
be held in three stages -- the first stage being a drill to open command centers
to station personnel, the second a drill to protect the nation's infrastructure,
and the third computerized war games.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) legislative caucus
said Wednesday that the media has "stretched its imagination too far" by
reporting on Ma's assassination as the war games scenario.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-liang said that it is not appropriate for the media to
issue false reports that could cause public unease.</P>
      <P>Tsai's colleague Kuan Pi-ling called for Ma to take part in the war games,
saying that Ma's team had already contacted a transitional team assigned by
President Chen Shui-bian, and that Ma's absence from this year's war games was
"irresponsible."</P>
      <P>Ma declined an invitation last week to observe the computer war games, citing
the reason of a "tight schedule."</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Ma's office declined Wednesday to comment on the magazine's
reports, saying it is the Presidential Office that should elaborate on the
matter.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu called for Ma to attend the war games Wednesday,
urging that the nation's affairs, especially national security, should be run
without interruption as the two political parties prepare to make the
transition.</P>

      <P>Noting that the transfer of power only changes the government, and not the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's leading food manufacturer, AGV Products Corp., decided Wednesday to
recall two brands of fresh milk that it markets, in the wake of a report that
the products are contaminated by milk from diseased cows.</P>
      <P>The affected brands are Highland and Ching Chun, both of which are processed by
an AGV-contracted dairy operated by the Miaoli County Farmers' Association.</P>
      <P>According to an investigative report published that day by Apple Daily, one of
the plant's suppliers in Yunlin County has provided it with diseased milk that
was collected from neighboring dairy farms. Such milk -- which refers to milk
produced by cows during and immediately after the period when they are receiving
medication -- is forbidden to be processed for human consumption.</P>
      <P>The report said the milk, which was bought at a low price of approximately NT$8
per kilogram, was sold to the dairy at NT$18 per kilogram, bringing in profits
estimated at NT$1 million per month to the unscrupulous supplier.</P>
      <P>AGV said in a statement that it will investigate the extent of the dairy's
responsibility and pointed out that according to the terms of their contract,
the dairy is responsible for ensuring the quality of the ingredients used in
production.</P>
      <P>However, officials at the Miaoli County Farmers' Association dismissed the Apple
Daily report as totally false.</P>
      <P>The officials said the milk is required to undergo drug residue screening tests
upon delivery to the dairy, which includes tests for tetracycline, penicillin,
sulfonamides and chloramphenicol.</P>
      <P>Any milk detected with traces of these antibiotics is immediately rejected, they
said.</P>
      <P>In light of the wide attention the incident has drawn, the Yunlin District
Prosecutors Office later that same day raided the dairy farm that allegedly sold
the diseased milk and seized 4,000 kg of milk for testing.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday,  the Miaoli county health and agricultural authorities visited
the dairy to collect milk products for testing.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-ying, chief of the county's Animal Health Inspection and Quarantine
Institute, noted that there are 25 dairy farms with a combined total of 2,000
head in the county.</P>
      <P>Of the total of 175 milk samples tested by the institute last year, none were
found to contain traces of antibiotics, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Consumers' Foundation Chairman Cheng Jen-hung called on AGV to
provide free health examinations and other remedial measures to consumers who
might have consumed the questionable milk and said that any consumers who feel
physically uncomfortable after consuming  the products can ask the foundation
to help seek compensation from AGV.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu reiterated Wednesday his intention to remain in his
current post, amid reports of an offer to serve as secretary-general in the
office of the incoming president, Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>There  has been  wide speculation  that Hu,  whose  local administration in the
central Taiwan city won a four-star public rating in a poll conducted by the
Taipei-based Global Views Monthly Magazine in 2007, has been tapped for the post
of presidential secretary-general when Ma takes office.</P>
      <P>Citing Hu, Deputy Taichung Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi reiterated that no one from Ma's
camp had directly made such an offer to the mayor, and that Hu had not changed
his mind about wanting to remain in his current post to fulfill the promises he
made to Taichung residents in his 2005 re-election campaign.</P>
      <P>Hu's second mayoral term will end in December 2009 after which he would be
ineligible to run for the position again.</P>
      <P>In the 2007 survey, Hu was evaluated as having the cleanest image among the 23
local government chiefs in Taiwan, and a spotless anti-corruption record.</P>
      <P>Hu, born in 1948, holds a doctoral degree in International Relations from Oxford
University in Britain. He has served as head of the Government Information
Office, as an envoy at Taiwan's representative office in Washington, United
States, and as minister of foreign affairs under the previous Kuomintang
government. He was first elected as Taichung mayor in 2001.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The owner of the only Taiwanese outlet of a popular Chinese hot pot restaurant
chain announced Wednesday an ambitious plan to open 50 new restaurants here over
the next three years, in anticipation of an influx of Chinese tourists promised
by President-elect Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Tony Huang, owner of the only Little Sheep restaurant that currently exists in
Taiwan, told a news conference that the chain intends to open restaurants
throughout Taiwan, with the aim not only of introducing typical Mongolian hot
pot cuisine to locals but also of catering to the taste buds of an increasing
number of Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>Huang predicted that the sluggish economy in Taiwan during the past few years
will be revitalized soon and that cross-strait exchanges between mainland China
and Taiwan are expected to increase.</P>
      <P>"Opening more chain restaurants will give rise to greater competitiveness for
our restaurant, " Huang told CNA on the sidelines of the news conference.
"Through this expansion, we also hope to set up a model for other chain
restaurants from China that want to invest in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ma, slated to take office on May 20, has pledged to allow more Chinese tourists
to visit Taiwan, raising the hopes of the Taiwanese restaurant industry for a
higher volume of visitors from mainland China and their attendant consumption
of Taiwanese goods and services.</P>
      <P>The Little Sheep chain -- known in Chinese as the Xiao Fei Yang chain --
specializes in lamb hot pot, serving up plates of thinly sliced raw lamb strips
that are dunked into pots of boiling broth and cook within seconds. The meat,
which can be substituted with beef, chicken, fish and vegetables, is then dipped
in various sauces.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the press conference, Yu-fu, a host of TV food programs, said that
opening more Chinese chain restaurants will "help upgrade the diversity of
cuisine found in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>However, Huang said the chain, which is popular in mainland China, has seen a
lot of copycats in Taiwan, which use almost identical trademarks.</P>
      <P>To deal with the problem, Huang said, he will launch a campaign to battle piracy
and safeguard the rights of both Little Sheep and its customers.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI) urged the
Cabinet Wednesday to guide Taiwan through the challenge of continuing price
hikes of raw materials in the international market.</P>
      <P>As the impact of rising prices has continued to increase, CNFI Chairman Chen Wu-
hsiung urged the outgoing Democratic Progressive Party government  not to leave
the problem to the Kuomintang administration that will take office following
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's May 20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, if the issue is left until after May 20, "it will be too
late" to handle the problem that he described as posing a far greater threat to
Taiwan than the first and second crude oil price crises of the 1970s and 1980s.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held by the CNFI, Chen pointed out that not only have
international oil prices been increasing steadily, but prices of rice, wheat,
soy beans, corn, steel rebar, cement, gravel and various petrochemical raw
materials have also continued to rise unabated.</P>
      <P>The CNFI urged the government to take measures that include lowering the
business tax on petroleum products, prohibiting exports of vital materials and
expanding imported raw material sources.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More gene mutation found related to Parkinsonism in Han Chinese</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An international cooperative project has spotted a Parkinsonism-related gene
mutation that only develops in Han Chinese, and these who carry this mutation
are twice more likely to develop Parkinson's disease.</P>
      <P>The mutation, known as R1628P is found in gene LRRK2 which codes for protein
Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, according to a paper produced from the project
partially funded by the cabinet-level National Science Council and published in
the science journal, Annals of Neurology.</P>
      <P>Parkinsonism, also known as Parkinson syndrome, is a degenerative disorder of
the central nervous system that often impairs the patient's speech and movement.</P>
      <P>The group of experts from Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and the United States has
already reported other Parkinsonism-related mutations linked to LRRK2 and has
found correlations between different ethnic groups and individual mutations.</P>
      <P>For example, the experts found that LRRK2-G2019S is a common cause of
Parkinsonism among Berber Arabs and Ashkenazi Jews.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the group reported that a mutation, G2385R in LRRK2, was linked to
Parkinsonism in Asians, especially Han Chinese.</P>
      <P>Individuals carrying the mutation were more than twice more likely to develop
the disease than non-carriers, it was reported.</P>
      <P>The LRRK2-G2385R mutation does not appear to play a role in Parkinson's disease
within other racial groups, according to the research results published in 2005.</P>
      <P>Their analysis concluded that the G2385R mutation occurred approximately 4,800
years ago, corresponding with the rise of Chinese civilization.</P>
      <P>The study of LRRK2-G2385R is mainly conducted by subgroups of the project based
in National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) in Taipei and the Mayo Clinic in
Jacksonville, Florida.</P>
      <P>On the newly found R1628P, Wu Ruey-meei, director of NTUH's Center for
Parkinsonism and Movement Disorder and a participant in the study, noted that
LRRK2-R1628P mutation could also double the risk of Han Chinese developing
Parkinson's syndrome.  However, Japanese, who were also a target group in the
research of 2007-2008, showed no indication for such a mutation, he said.</P>
      <P>The incidence rate of R1628P mutation is estimated to be three in 100 among Han
Chinese, Wu said, adding that this mutation might be have been passed down some
2,500 years ago.</P>

      <P>Some 250 cyclists will take part in a 200-km ride in Taiwan's southernmost
county of Pintung April 19 in the spirit of challenging their own physical
limits and trying to go farther and farther on a single ride.</P>
      <P>The non-competitive event is being held by Randonneurs Taiwan and the Taiwan
Super Triathlon Association.</P>
      <P>Cyclists will set off at 6 a.m. from the visitors' center of the Dapeng Bay
National Scenic Area and ride along a scenic route all the way to Eluanbi, the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, before returning via a much different route to
finish at the visitors' center.</P>
      <P>Riders who complete the course within 13 hours 30 minutes will receive a
Randonneurs pin and will qualify to participate in the next level of the event.</P>
      <P>Randonneur cycling originated in France in the 1890s. The sport has become
popular in other parts of the world, including Italy, the United Kingdom, the
United States, Canada and Asian countries.</P>
      <P>There are two kinds of rides in a randonneurs event: brevets and populaires. A
populaire is intended to introduce new riders to the club. In a brevet, a French
word meaning suffering, cyclists follow a set route in their desired distance,
moving up to longer rides.</P>
      <P>A rider must complete the four races in the basic series -- 200 km, 300 km, 400
km, and 600 km -- in order to qualify for the 1,200-km Paris-Brest-Paris race,
which takes place every four years.</P>
      <P>The 1,200-km Paris event, a grueling test of human endurance and cycling
ability, begins on the southern side of the French capital, travels 600
kilometers west to the port city of Brest on the Atlantic Ocean and returns
along the same route.</P>
      <P>Randonneurs gain international  recognition from Audax Club Parisien, creator of
the sport, by riding 5,000 km in official randonneur events within four years.
The 1,200 km Paris-Brest-Paris is one of the most prestigious rides that must be
completed to fulfill the requirements for the 5,000 km award.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's technology exports not sufficient: academic</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's technology exports are not sufficient, with the value amounting to only
about a quarter of the island's technology imports, the head of the nation's
highest academic research institute said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong made the remarks when he reported on
technology transfer records in recent years to a legislative committee.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuan Pi-ling from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
the value of Taiwan's technology exports only amounts to several billions of
Taiwan dollars a year although the value of imports reaches NT$40 billion,
showing that "exports are only one quarter of the imports."</P>
      <P>She said that in technologically advanced countries such as the United States
and Britain, technology exports could be as high as two folds of imports of
technological products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not even on par with South Korea, Kuan said, noting that technology
exports are between 23 percent and 25 percent of its imports in South Korea,
while in Taiwan, the ratio is usually between 13 percent and 17 percent.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's performance is indeed not satisfying," Wong admitted.</P>
      <P>In terms of patents, Wong said that Academia Sinica has applied for 598 patents
at home and overseas over the past nine years, and acquired 207 patents, among
them 108 were acquired from the United States, especially in the areas of
biotechnology and new drugs.</P>
      <P>Wong also noted that Academia Sinica has signed 321 agreements with domestic and
foreign companies since early this year to transfer technology, but whether the
companies can successfully develop products after the technology transfers will
largely depend on the relations between the inventors, research institutes and
the industries.</P>
      <P>Wong suggested an amendment to the Civil Servant Service Act, noting that many
civil servants are barred from serving the posts of advisers, directors and
supervisors of companies under the law, so that there is still a gap between
research and the development of a product.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Charity calls for 'one-day salary' donation for children's safety</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A foundation devoted to improving children's safety Wednesday invited the public
to donate at least one day's salary to help children injured in accidents, as
part of Taiwan's first National Children's Safety Day.</P>
      <P>The Jing Chuan Child Safety Foundation said money raised will be used by the
non-profit group to help enhance its ability to provide aftermath care to
children injured in accidents.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Yue-chin, the foundation's chief executive officer, accidents
are the main cause of death for children in both Taiwan and in the world. Every
year, around 300,000 children in Taiwan are injured or killed in accidents which
happen in many places,  including at home, on roads, in classrooms,  and on
playgrounds.</P>
      <P>The foundation provides aftermath care because many families do not know how to
deal with children's injuries. They need to know how to respond to injuries with
proper medical treatment as well as a healthy mental state, Lin said, adding
that families also should know how to protect themselves through the legal
process.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully the donation will allow us to set up a center to integrate resources
in providing better aftermath care to injured children and their families, " Lin
told a CNA reporter.</P>
      <P>Half of the donations will be used to integrate current resources of aftermath
care for children hurt in accidents. The care includes medical counselling,
psychologic counselling, legal counselling, and support for parents who undergo
self-blame and social condemnation, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The other half of the donations will be used to sponsor the foundation's work in
preventing children's accidents, Lin added.</P>
      <P>This year's donation amount is projected to reach NT$10 million (US$328,950),
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has designated May 15 as National Children's Safety Day in
memory of Lin Jing-chuan, a Taipei City kindergarten teacher who died in a
school bus fire while trying to rescue children in her care May 15, 1992.</P>
      <P>The foundation was established one year after the accident in the hope of
raising awareness from the public and the government about providing a safer
environment for children.</P>
      <P>Lin said that designating a special day to highlight the importance of
children's safety is a consolation for families of those who died in the
accident as it increases people's awareness of child safety.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, officials at both the central and local governments, as well
as their friends and families, have donated to the fundraising drive after it
was officially launched in April.</P>
      <P>The whole police staff at Taoyuan County's Gueishan division in northern Taiwan
even actively made donations before the drive's official launch, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that MasterLink Securities Corp. Chairman Wang Pei-chih, and
Scania Taiwan, a large vehicle manufacturer, have made donations.</P>

the country's new president.</P>
      <P>Santana made the remarks after attending a tea party organized by Ma for
ambassadors and representatives of Taiwan's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>According to Ma's spokesman Lo Chih-chiang, ambassadors and representatives of
18 of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies attended the gathering, the first formal
contact between the diplomatic corps in Taiwan and Ma since he was elected on
March 22.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Ma assured the foreign diplomats that he will continue all
the cooperation projects that the current Democratic Progressive Party
administration signed with Taiwan's diplomatic allies, and he invited the allies
to send representatives to attend his inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>In addition to promising continued support for Taiwan's bid to enter
international organizations, several foreign diplomats also invited Ma to visit
their respective countries after he takes office.</P>
      <P>Asked by journalists whether he saw any difference between the foreign policies
of President Chen Shui-bian and Ma, Santana said it is natural that two leaders
would have different working styles. However, he said he foresees no fundamental
change in Taiwan's foreign policy under a new leader.</P>
      <P>Regarding reports that Ma was planning to economize on his inauguration ceremony
and had thus decided that visiting foreign leaders would not be accommodated in
presidential suites, Santana said he and other diplomats do not think such an
arrangement would be a discourtesy or an inconvenience to the foreign

      <P>Sony Taiwan signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Wednesday to include
Taiwan in its program to encourage the production of eco-friendly electronic
products, with the program expected to help local high-tech manufacturers boost
their business  by being considered  top global  green-product suppliers.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan branch of the Japanese electronic giant signed the agreement  with
the Taiwan Green Environmental  Partner (TGEP) Promotion Center, which will
create a certification system to help local electronic component makers meet
Sony's Green Partner Standards (GP).</P>
      <P>Once they obtain the certificate, Taiwanese manufacturers will be considered
high-quality, eco-friendly electronics makers -- a status that is expected to
help them gain more production orders.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the certificate, manufacturers must meet Sony's set of
standards, which involves limiting the amount of toxic substances used to make
the products.</P>
      <P>"By jointly establishing a system controlling the products' toxic chemicals
while enhancing production capacity,  Sony will help Taiwan's industry to boost
its business in the global green industry market, " said Itoh Masashi, Sony's
General Manager of Supplier Relations Department of its Procurement Center.</P>
      <P>Citing the rising global awareness of the importance of using eco-friendly
electronic products, Itoh, who was speaking at a news conference of the signing,
indicated that companies which meet Sony's standards can obtain business orders
from the Japanese electronics giant and expand their clients around the world.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed days after Sony president Ryoji Chubachi made a
commitment to increase procurement and investment in Taiwan during a meeting
with President-elect Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the MOU is part of Sony's future procurement plan for Taiwan, Sony
Taiwan's Chairman Kenji Sakai did not give a direct answer, saying only that an
upgraded Taiwanese green industry would naturally receive more procurement from
Sony.</P>
      <P>"The GP program will compose a win-win situation for both Sony and Taiwan
industries," Sakai said.</P>
      <P>The TGEP center, which signed the agreement with Sony, is run by two local
organizations -- the Institute for Information Industry and the Corporate
Synergy Development Center.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), which sponsored the TGEP center,
welcomed Sony's plan, pointing out the potential boost in production value for
local companies.</P>
      <P>"The MOEA expects NT$3 billion (US$98 million) in production value from 400
local manufacturers applying for the program this year, " said Lo Ta-sheng, a
section chief of the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau.</P>
      <P>Lo added that the ministry will push Taiwanese electronics makers to meet Sony's
standards and obtain the certificate before the end of 2008.</P>
      <P>With the certificate, which will help Taiwan's electronic makers qualify as
global makers of green products, Taiwan's industry could access a market that
reaches US$81.2 billion per year, according to Lo.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's industry would expand its edge over other electronic suppliers of the
world," Lo noted.</P>
      <P>The project could allow more local makers to enter the global supplier chain by
assisting them to meet the green product standards in developed countries,
including the U.S., Japan and European countries, Lo added.</P>
      <P>Sony recorded consolidated annual sales of approximately US$70.3 billion for the
fiscal year that ended March 31, 2007. The company employs 163,000 people

increase the oxygen level in water, with the aim of helping to improve the
production of mouthbreeder fish, Taiwan's Ambassador to El Salvador Carlos Liao
told a CNA reporter Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's agricultural  aid team began to provide technical assistance to the
central American ally in 1999, and has since helped Salvadoran fishermen to
increase fish production volume.</P>
      <P>El Salvador now has an annual production of 1,200 tons of mouthbreeder fish,
which is 25 times the 2000 figure, Liao said, adding that the donation of
aerators will now help to improve production quality.</P>
      <P>Officials at Taiwan's embassy in El Salvador and Salvadoran officials  exchanged
views  Tuesday  on  the  progress  of a Taiwan-sponsored project on the early
examination and treatment of newborns with congenital diseases such as
hypothyroidism -- reduced levels of thyroid hormone -- Liao said.</P>
      <P>El Salvador's public hospitals do not have the techniques or service to offer
such treatment, and charges at private hospitals are too high for the poor, Liao
said. He expressed the hope that the health project will give more of a chance
to babies with congenital diseases born to poor families.</P>
      <P>Liao also presented a donation Wednesday  to the Regional Organization for Plant
Protection and Animal Health based in El Salvador to help facilitate the
integration of fishing and aquaculture in central America.</P>
      <P>The integration project was officially launched by Taiwan's embassy in El

      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said Wednesday he would welcome
Chinese investment and tourists to his county, but fretted about possible
speculation in the local housing sector.</P>
      <P>Yang, a senior member of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), made the
comments to reporters while talking about a planned wider opening to China by
the incoming government of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou from the DPP's rival
party, the Kuomintang (KMT). Ma will assume the presidency May 20.</P>
      <P>He has pledged to build closer economic and trade links with China by easing
Taiwan investment in China while also allowing Chinese investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew also has advocated establishing a cross-Taiwan

investment to jointly develop the resort island, adding that Chinese capital is
also welcome.</P>
      <P>However,  he expressed concerns that some Chinese property investors might enter
the Taiwanese market merely to speculate.</P>
      <P>Yang added that he is not in favor of exporting Taiwan's fruits to China out of
grave concern over rampant counterfeit and piracy in the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>He argued that Taiwan's fruit exporters should focus their sights on the
Japanese, South Korean and Hong Kong markets, which have a great interest in
Taiwan's vegetables and fruits and offer better protection for industry
expertise.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan has long been a stronghold of the pro-
independence DPP. The DPP presidential ticket scored more ballots than the KMT's
Ma-Siew ticket in the southern Taiwan county during the March 22 presidential
election, despite the KMT's big gains in most of the other constituencies.

out of fears that it would push up private house prices beyond local residents'
means.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Environmental groups want timetable for greenhouse gas reduction</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three environmental activist groups in Taiwan expressed their opposition
Wednesday to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Bill being deliberated in the
legislature, on grounds that the  legislation  provides  no target  or timetable
for  its implementation.</P>
      <P>At a joint press conference held in front of the Legislative Yuan, the Green
Party Taiwan, the Green Citizens' Action Alliance and the Taiwan Environmental
Action Network urged the legislature not to pass the bill.</P>
      <P>They made their positions  known  after  the legislature's Sanitation,
Environment and Labor Committee met a day earlier to deliberate on the language
of the bill.</P>
      <P>The executives of the three civic organizations contended that the nation is now
in a period of confusion right before the transition of power from the outgoing
Democratic Progressive Party government to the Kuomintang, and that it is an
inappropriate time to consider the draft bill submitted by the incumbent
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Pan Han-chiang, secretary-general of the Taiwan Environmental Action Network,
noted that the current version of the bill is similar to the one introduced in
May last year, except that the current version has deleted the clauses
committing to an overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as
reductions by individual sectors.</P>
      <P>"The legislation can no longer be called a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Bill, " Pan
said. "If a person wants to lose weight, the first step is to find out how much
he weighs, and the next step is to set a target and timetable for losing
weight."</P>
      <P>Pan added that his organization and the other environmental groups are not happy
with a proposal floated by some legislators that an article should be added to
the draft bill to stipulate that Taiwan's carbon dioxide emission level should
be maintained at the 2007 level.</P>
      <P>"We hope Taiwan's greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced to the 1990 level,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Pan urged the legislature to shelve the bill and re-examine the issue carefully
and, at the same time, to prepare a supplementary law and regulations to
encourage the development of renewable energy and to levy additional taxes on
producers of carbon dioxide.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan's transportation affairs committee approved Wednesday the
2008 budget plan for Taiwan Post Co. but on condition that the state-owned
postal company change its name back to Chunghwa Post within six months.</P>
      <P>The proviso was proposed by Legislator Chen Ken-te of the main opposition
Kuomintang, who argued that the change of the company's name to "Taiwan Post" in
February 2007 did not follow the due process of law.</P>
      <P>The committee agreed on the six-month deadline so as to avoid politicizing the
decision on the name change ahead of the handover of government on May 20, the
lawmaker said.</P>
      <P>The incumbent pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party government, in line
with its "Taiwan identity" ideology, launched a movement last year to change the
designation of state-run enterprises whose titles included the word "China" or
"Chinese."</P>
      <P>However, the change of the postal company's name triggered protests among its
workers who denounced it as a politically expedient move.</P>
      <P>Some detractors also argued that the removal of the word Chunghwa, which means
China in Chinese, was problematic because an amendment to the law regulating
postal operations had not been passed in the legislature.</P>

      <P>A Swedish couple met for the first time Wednesday a two-year-old Taiwanese boy
with congenital bone disease whom they have adopted, in the central county of
Taichung.</P>
      <P>The couple, known by the surname Nordholm, will remain in Taichung for two weeks
to get to know Hauhau, as the child is called, before flying back to Sweden with
him, said Pai Li-fang, supervisor of the Child Welfare League Foundation.</P>
      <P>During this time, the foster parents who had been taking care of the abandoned
boy, will have time to adjust to the idea of him leaving, Pai added.</P>
      <P>Hauhau was found abandoned in the county's Shenkang township in September 2006,
not long after he was born, and was diagnosed with congenital funnel chest, or
pectus excavatum, which is caused when the breast bone is pushed abnormally
inward, according to Pai.</P>
      <P>She said it is more difficult to find homes for children like Hauhau who have
deformities than for healthy children. Such children are usually adopted by
foreigners if there are no local prospects, Pai added.</P>
      <P>After an unsuccessful six-month search by Taichung County police for Hauhau's
biological parents, he was made a legal ward of Taichung County Magistrate Huang
Chung-sheng and put into foster care.</P>
      <P>The foster parents, known by the last name Li, did their best to take care of
Hauhau, Pai said, adding that there were times when an ambulance siren was often
heard between the Li's home and hospitals.</P>
      <P>Hauhau's health is now stable, thanks to the care given by the Lis, and he will
now likely be in the good hands, as his adoptive mother is in the medical
profession, she said.</P>
      <P>The Swedish couple said they are ready to welcome Hauhau as their first child
after six years of longing for a baby.</P>
      <P>Taichung County Deputy Magistrate Chang Chuang-hsi said he believed that
Hauhau's future will be a happy one with the love of his new parents.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taichung Count has an annual budget to help find future homes for
abandoned children. He called on people who wish to adopt children to contact

    <HEADLINE>Taipower to phase out preferential billing of servicemen</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
04/16/08  23:32:54

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) will phase out preferential household
electricity billing for military servicemen over a three-year period, Vice
Economics Minister Hsieh Fa-ta said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that, starting next year, Taipower will start to cut preferential
billing by one third for active servicemen and approved families of deceased
servicemen.</P>
      <P>"Taipower will scrap the preferential treatment by 2012, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He said that under an agreement between the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
and the Ministry of National Defense (MND) , the MND will appropriate funds for
electricity subsides to servicemen starting next year.</P>
      <P>He said that the ministry has adopted the measures at the suggestion of the
legislators, who said the move was a fair one and will help conserve energy.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers noted that Taipower has had to appropriate NT$640 million
(US$21.05 million) per year in subsidies for the preferential billing of
servicemen, although the company is in the red because of soaring world fuel
prices.</P>
      <P>Moreover, because of the preferential treatment, military servicemen were found
to have been using 20 percent more electricity than the average household, which
the lawmakers said was "tantamount to encouraging waste."</P>
      <P>Under the current preferential system, Taipower gives 50 percent discount for
the consumption of less than 500 kilowatt/hour of electricity per month, 30
percent for between 501 kw/h and 1,000 kw/h, and charges full price for
consumption of more than 1,000 kw/h.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipower Chairman Edward Chen said Wednesday that if the company
cannot raise electricity rates, its losses will increase.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of a legislative committee that was reviewing Taipower's
annual budget, Chen noted that the government has frozen fuel prices since late
last year for fear of triggering inflationary pressure on consumer prices,
despite soaring world crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>He said that if the state-run petroleum company CPC Co. Taiwan maintains its
gasoline price, then Taipower will lose between NT$130 billion and NT$150
billion a year.</P>
      <P>But if CPC hikes its gasoline price and Taipower cannot raise its fees, then the
power company's losses will amount to NT$200 billion annually, Chen said, adding
that this could lead to Taipower gradually depleting its financial resources in
2009 and going bankrupt in 2010.</P>
      <P>The question of when President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's incoming government, which
has said that it would respect the market mechanism, will adjust the gasoline
and electricity rates remains uncertain, Chen said. Ma will assume the
presidency May 20.</P>
      <P>If CPC raises its gasoline prices June 1, and Taipower could follow suit one
month later, then Taipower "will have to raise electricity rates by 50 percent
to break even this year," Chen said.</P>
      <P>As such an increase could impact heavily on the daily lives of consumers, Chen
said, he is suggesting a hike of 30 percent in the first stage, which would
translate into an increase of NT$0.65 to NT$2.8 from an average of NT$2.15 per
kilowatt/hour last year.</P>

      <P>Taipei was rated the world's 18th most popular host city for international
meetings in 2007, as a total of 67 such events took place in the city during
that year, according to rankings released recently by the Dutch-based
International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA).</P>
      <P>The result marks a remarkable leap for Taipei, which was rated 40th in 2006 when
only 29 meetings were held in the city, the ICCA's top 20 country and city
rankings for 2007 revealed.</P>
      <P>The rankings  consider meetings organized  by international associations, which
take place on a regular basis and which rotate among a minimum of three
countries. ICCA data shows that more than 6,500 such events took place worldwide
in 2007, representing an increase of approximately 800 from 2006.</P>
      <P>Topping the city rankings for 2007 was Vienna, which hosted 154 meetings during
the year. Berlin, Singapore, Paris and Barcelona rounded out the top five by
hosting 123, 120, 115 and 106 meetings, respectively.</P>
      <P>Among Asian cities, Taipei's ranking advanced from ninth in 2006 to sixth in
2007, behind Singapore, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul and Bangkok.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, however, did not make the top 20 country rankings for 2007, which were

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) adjusted Thursday its
forecast upward for Taiwan's economic growth for 2008 from 4.16 percent to 4.67
percent.</P>
      <P>Wang Lee-rong, director of the CIER's Center for Economic Forecasting, said the
CIER's revised economic projections were based on high demand from China in the
first quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>Wang said although the U.S. economy is expected to slow due to subprime mortgage
woes, the Chinese economy performed better than expected in light of the brisk
international trade in the first quarter of this year, and is expected to grow
at 10 percent for the whole year.</P>
      <P>With the high demand for Taiwan's optical equipment, electrical and electronic
products, machineries and telecommunication products from China, Taiwan's
economic growth in the first quarter is likely to top 6.28 percent, 1.8 percent
higher than originally predicted.</P>
      <P>The CIER, a government-funded economic think tank, predicted that Taiwan's
economic growth will reach 4.42 percent for the second quarter, 4.15 percent for
the third quarter and 3.93 percent for the fourth quarter, with the growth for
the whole year registering 4.67 percent. It forecast that the economic growth
will further expand to 5.43 percent in 2009.</P>
      <P>The CIER also predicted the country's private consumption for the whole year
will rise by 3.29 percent, with private investment to increase by 5.11 percent.</P>
      <P>On the country's inflation rate, the CIER revised upward its prediction for the
consumer price index (CPI) for the whole of 2008 from 2 percent to 2.64 percent,
with fuel and electricity price hikes being excluded from the calculation.</P>
      <P>Wang said it is difficult to take fuel and electricity prices into the CPI
measure at the moment as the government's fuel pricing mechanism and
complementary measures are still unclear. But Wang admitted that commodity price
hikes will have great effect on the country's economic growth.</P>
      <P>Wang cited the evaluation by the Council of Economic Planning and Development as
noting that if the government's plan to hike petroleum prices by NT$2.8 per
liter and increase power rates by NT$0.65 per unit after May is implemented and
the exchange rate of the Taiwan Dollar against the U.S. Dollar remains at 30 by
the end of this year, the CPI will increase by more than 1 percent. This means
that the CPI for the whole year will approach 3 percent, while economic growth
will drop by 1 percent, representing 3.3 percent for the entire year. Wang said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan citizens with tertiary education levels of training outnumbered those
with senior high school levels for the first time in 2007, as higher education
continues to widen in the country, according to a report released Thursday by
the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>The report showed that the number of Taiwan citizens with tertiary education
levels of training accounted for 33.85 percent of the population aged 15 and
over at the end of 2007, while those with senior high school levels accounted
for 33.21 percent, and those with elementary school levels accounted for 15.69
percent.</P>
      <P>The number of people in the population age group 15 and over who have received
higher education has increased by 17.9 percentage points over the past 10 years,
the report said.</P>
      <P>At the end of 2007, there were 18.928 million people aged 15 and over,
accounting for 82.44 percent of the country's total population, the report
noted.</P>
      <P>The literacy rate among this population group stood at 97.6 percent at the end
of 2007, meaning that 2.4 in every 100 persons in the age group could not read
or write.</P>
      <P>In terms of gender, the literacy rate was 3.5 percentage points lower among
women than among men,  with the difference being especially obvious among those
aged 65 and over where the literacy rate among men was 22.6 percentage points
higher than among women.</P>
      <P>In the 15-40 age group, however, the literacy rates between men and women were
comparable, the report said.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwan citizens with tertiary education levels totaled 6.408
million at the end of 2007, up 4.47 percent from the previous year. Among this
number, 3.38 million, or 52.75 percent, were men, and 3.027 million, or 47.25
percent, were women.</P>
      <P>Noticeably, more women than men had received higher education in the under-35
age group, but the opposite was true among older people.</P>
      <P>Of those with higher education levels, 3.282 million either had studied in or
graduated from universities, 2.404 million either had studied in or graduated
from colleges, and 722,000 either had studied in or graduated from graduate
schools, according to the report.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that the government  is
communicating  with its diplomatic allies and other major countries in the World
Health Organization (WHO) on how to approach Taiwan's bid to join the health
regulatory body this year, and that it will submit President Chen Shui-bian's
letter to the WHO in the coming days.</P>
      <P>In accordance  with Taiwan's  new strategy of seeking WHO representation,
President Chen will write to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan to express the
country's intention to join the organization as a full member under the name
Taiwan, or at least as an observer in its decision-making body -- the World
Health Assembly (WHA) -- also under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOFA will ask Taiwan's diplomatic allies that are also WHO
members to submit its application at this year's WHA conference scheduled to
take place in Geneva May 19-24.</P>
      <P>"We hope that such a flexible and pragmatic approach will gain more support from
the members of the WHO," Lily Hsu, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department
of International Organizations, said at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>She added that the government  is communicating  with its diplomatic allies and
major countries such as the United States, Japan and the nations of the European
Union, on how to execute the bid.</P>
      <P>"Only by obtaining at least observer status in the WHA can Taiwan really enjoy
the so called 'meaningful participation'," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. and Japan have openly expressed their support for Taiwan to have
"meaningful participation, " meaning that Taiwan should be allowed to join WHO
technical meetings and activities.</P>
      <P>As to the views of Taiwan's diplomatic allies regarding this year's WHO bid, Hsu
said they are all well aware of Taiwan's stance.</P>
      <P>"Our diplomatic allies understand our requests clearly and know that we do not
intend to change the official name of our nation or the status quo across the
Taiwan Strait with the use of the name Taiwan," she stressed. "The name has been
chosen because it is what is commonly used in the international community when
referring to us."</P>
      <P>Hsu said President Chen's letter to the WHO will be submitted in the coming
days, since application for membership has to be submitted one month in advance.
But she declined to elaborate on the exact date and contents of the letter.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been trying, unsuccessfully, to become an observer in the WHA under
its official title, the Republic of China, since 1997. Last year, it applied for
full WHO membership as "Taiwan" for the first time, but the bid failed again for
the same reason as before -- China's opposition on the grounds that Taiwan is
part of its territory.</P>
      <P>As the country's new government is due to take office one day after the opening
of the WHA this year, Taiwan's bid to join the world health regulatory body has
attracted even more attention than usual.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic group condemned legislators of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Thursday for instigating a plan calling for the delinking of wages for migrant
blue-collar workers from the Labor Standards Act that also governs minimum wages
for workers in the country.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Labor Front (TLF) lashed out at four KMT legislators for having
proposed an amendment to a statute governing free trade harbors and relevant
affairs, which called for a separation of wages for migrant workers employed at
free trade harbors from the minimum wage stipulated in the Labor Standards Act.</P>
      <P>The KMT-initiated amendment proposes that wages for migrant workers at Taiwan's
free trade harbors should be decided by the employers and employees and should
not be governed by the Labor Standards Act, according to TLF Secretary-General
Sun You-lien.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment also calls for a lower hiring percentage of aboriginal
workers at free trade harbors.</P>
      <P>Sun said the proposed amendment would be an unfair law that would discriminate
against migrant workers and would allow local employers to exploit their foreign
employees.</P>
      <P>Sun urged the KMT lawmakers to withdraw what he called the discriminatory draft
amendment.</P>
      <P>The TLF leaders also urged KMT President-elect Ma Ying-jeou to restrain his

      <P>Authorities are expected to release on April 21 the results of tests on milk
reportedly contaminated by the milk of diseased cows, a Council of Agriculture
(COA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang Ing-haur, director of the COA's Department of Animal Industry, said health
and agricultural authorities collected samples of both raw and processed milk
for tests immediately after news about the possible contamination broke a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>Huang said the council will make sure the tests are completed as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a news conference held by the opposition Kuomintang
legislative caucus, during which Huang and several other officials were invited
to brief the media on their handling of the incident.</P>
      <P>At issue are two brands of fresh milk -- Highland and Chiang Chun -- which are
marketed by the leading food manufacturer, AGV Products Corp., and processed by
an AGV-contracted dairy processing plant in Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>According to an investigative report published Wednesday by Apple Daily, one of
the plant's suppliers in Yunlin County has provided it with milk from diseased
cows that was purchased at low prices from neighboring dairy farms. Such milk --
which were produced by cows during and immediately after the period when they
are receiving medication -- is forbidden to be processed for human consumption.</P>
      <P>The revelation prompted food manufacturer AGV to recall the two brands of milk,
and health and agricultural authorities to launch an investigation into the
situation.</P>
      <P>Huang said the situation described in the Apple Daily report is quite unlikely
to have happened because according to guidelines set down by the council on the
procurement of raw milk by dairy processing plants, any milk tested with drug
residues upon delivery to the plants will be dyed and rejected.</P>
      <P>Of the more than 40,000 raw milk samples tested by the COA last year, 99.73
percent passed the tests, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hui-wen, director of the Department of Health's (DOH's) Bureau of Food
Safety, told the same meeting that fresh milk currently sold on the Taiwan
market should be safe, noting that all 243 products tested by the DOH last year
met the department's criteria.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Consumer-Protection Official Wang Teh-ming said major retailers have
removed the allegedly contaminated products from their store shelves and that if
consumers discover any of the products still on the market, they can inform the
Consumer Protection Commission.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has been sending out invitations to
international organizations for President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration
ceremony May 20 in accordance with its usual practice, an official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"International organizations will not be absent from the May 20 inauguration
ceremony, " Lily Hsu, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of
International Organizations, said at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>She added that the ministry had invited presidents and chairmen of several
international organizations that have close relations with Taiwan to attend the
event.</P>
      <P>Executive President of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration Harry
Brautigam and Paul Sun, Director-General of the World Vegetable Center, have
confirmed that they will attend, Hsu said. However, Asian Productivity
Organization's Secretary General Takashi Tajima will be unable to attend the
ceremony, she added.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that the ministry did not send out too many invitations but had
invited those who were on the list of attendees at the inauguration ceremonies
in 2000 and 2004, because President-elect Ma had asked his aides to limit
spending on the ceremony and avoid waste.</P>
      <P>To hold down costs, Ma's camp has decided to ask Taiwan's diplomatic allies to
limit the number of visiting representatives they send to the ceremony, and
foreign dignitaries will generally not be put up in presidential suites.</P>
      <P>So far, 14 heads of state and 3 vice presidents of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies
have confirmed that they will be present at the May 20 ceremony, setting a
historic record. Other countries without diplomatic ties with Taiwan have also
expressed great interest in sending special envoys and delegations to Taiwan,
Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Ma and his running mate, Vincent Siew,
won a landslide victory March 22 over the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
ticket of Frank Hsieh and Su Tseng-chang. The victory returned the KMT to power
eight years after its loss to the DPP in 2000, which ended more than five
decades of uninterrupted rule.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan remained the world's 16th largest merchandise exporter in 2007, but
showed slower growth in commercial services export, according to a report
released Thursday by the World Trade Organization (WTO) , raising concern among
some local analysts over the strength of Taiwan's services industry.</P>
      <P>The data was listed in an annual world statistics report issued by the Geneva-
based WTO, entitled "World Trade 2007, Prospects for 2008."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 2007 merchandise export reached US$246 billion, capping a 10 percent
annual growth and earning the 16th rank in the world, while import increased to
US$220 billion with an 8 percent growth year-on-year, maintaining the 17th place
from 2006.</P>
      <P>The total value of US$464 billion in merchandise trade made Taiwan the 17th
world trading power, behind its major competitors in the three newly
industrialized economies of South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, which ranked
11th, 13th, and 14th, respectively.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's commercial services export maintained 26th place in the world, with a
value of US$30 billion, but with a lackluster 5 percent growth, Taiwan was
outperformed by Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea which registered annual
growth of 13, 13 and 28 percent and ranked 12th, 14th and 15th, respectively.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also lagged far behind two of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China)
economies -- China (7) and India (11), and slightly behind Russian (25).</P>
      <P>"Somewhat weak export and import growth in dollar terms was reported for Japan
and Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), while growth remained moderate for Hong Kong and
Singapore," the report stated.</P>
      <P>Experts  in Taiwan warned about the weakness  in Taiwan's commercial service
export, saying the local industries had failed to develop export capacity in
major service sectors such as tourism, financial and transportation sectors.</P>
      <P>"The small growth in the number of inbound tourists is probably the biggest
problem in the commercial service sector, " said Cheng-Mount Cheng, chief
economist of Citibank Taiwan, adding that the regulation limiting the number of
Chinese tourists to Taiwan was one of the major obstacles.</P>
      <P>He said opening Taiwan to more Chinese tourists, which was part of the
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's campaign platform, could help to improve the
situation.</P>
      <P>"Three thousand or more (Chinese) tourists per day could boost both the
country's GDP and local market demands, which in turn would spur more business
and investment," he estimated.</P>
      <P>Touching on financial service exports, Cheng said local banks should provide
foreign tourists and businessmen with more services, such as direct fund
transfer and currency exchange, alluding to the restrictions on such exchanges
with China -- the biggest foreign capital magnet in Asia.</P>
      <P>"With a more open policy  toward  China (by the incoming administration), local
banks could locate their business and service destinations in China to take
advantage of those opportunities, " he stressed, adding that Taiwanese would
also rely less on foreign financial institutions for banking businesses.</P>
      <P>Chen said the relevant regulations also need to be relaxed in order to boost the
transportation sector, which he however noted was more competitive than the
tourism and financial service industries.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese shipping companies sometimes register their vessels under foreign
flags in order to access business in China because there are strict bans on
cross-Taiwan Strait trading and shipping, " he said, indicating that the income
made by those companies could not be included in Taiwan's export value.</P>
      <P>The WTO reported  stated  that due to the sharp economic deceleration in key
developed countries, 2007's world trade growth slid to 5.5 percent last year
from 8.5 percent in 2006, adding that the figure is likely to decline further to
4.5 percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>The continuing strong growth in emerging economies, such as China and India that
increased their merchandise exports by 26 percent and 20 percent, respectively,
could only partly offset the decline, the WTO report stated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China must face up to Taiwan's democracy: MAC official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's democracy is very valuable in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, and
Beijing has to adjust its policy in view of Taiwan's achievements in
democratization, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tung made the remarks while giving a speech on post-election ties between Taiwan
and mainland China during a seminar at a cultural center in the U.S. state of
Maryland.</P>
      <P>The seminar was sponsored by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative
Office in the United States and attended by more than 100 Taiwanese expatriates
living in the greater Washington area.</P>
      <P>Although  Beijing seems willing to give Taiwan's  incoming Kuomintang (KMT)
government greater space by not mentioning its "one China" principle in recent
days, Tung said, the Chinese government still has to face up to the existence of
the RepublIc of China (Taiwan) if it wants to make substantial progress in
bilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>President-elect  Ma Ying-jeou  of the KMT beat the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) rival, Frank Hsieh, in Taiwan's March 22 presidential election,
helping the KMT return to power after eight years of DPP rule.</P>
      <P>As Ma will assume the presidency on May 20, Tung said, Beijing needs to gear its
approach toward Taipei because of the new situation emerging in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since 2000 when the DPP swept to power, it has been doing its best to build
Taiwan's distinguished identity as a sovereignty independent from China and to
make eventual unification with China no longer the sole choice for Taiwan's
people, Tung said.</P>
      <P>The DPP's efforts have made Beijing shift from its previous goal of unifying
with Taiwan to a now anti-independence stance in its dealings with Taiwan, Tung
said.</P>
      <P>At a time  when  Taiwan  will soon inaugurate  its third democratically elected
president, he contended that Beijing must take new steps in settling its
relations with Taiwan due to the island's democratic advancement.</P>
      <P>Tung voiced  his hope that the newly-elected  Ma and his administration will
fare smoothly in inking accords with China to allow more Chinese tourists to
Taiwan and to open direct cargo and passenger transportation services between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>Tung suggested Taiwan and China start bilateral negotiations on undisputed
issues. He pointed to new signs on the Chinese side after Taiwan's recent
presidential election indicating Beijing appears to be willing to re-open two-
way dialogue by putting aside disputes.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tung pointed out, no Beijing official has so far publicly
recognized the "one China, separate interpretations" stance upheld by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the "one China" policy, China defines Taiwan as a part of its territory.
Ma and his party the KMT, however, prefers the concept of there being only one
China, with Taiwan and the mainland free to interpret on their own what that
China is.</P>
      <P>Giving his best wishes to the new government to be led by Ma, Tung said that the
DPP, which will soon become the opposition party, has to fully check and balance
the policies and decisions of the incoming new administration.</P>
      <P>He urged the KMT, which also controls nearly three quarters of the Legislative
Yuan's 113 seats, to forge a common ground with the opposition in enhancing
cross-strait ties and building foreign relations, so as to lead Taiwan into new
horizons.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a recent survey showed that some 340,000 Taiwanese over the age
of 40 have bought medicines or health foods promoted by unlicensed radio
stations.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by the monthly magazine Global Views and commissioned by the
Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs (BPA) under the Department of Health, surveyed
1,100 residents over 40 years old islandwide.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the poll, 14.6 percent of the respondents  had
bought unapproved  medicines  or health foods advertised by unauthorized radio
stations.</P>
      <P>Among those buyers of unapproved medicines, some had made single purchases
amounting to NT$60,000 (US$1,980).</P>
      <P>As a result, it is estimated that the total sales of these unapproved medicines,
especially Chinese herbal cures, or health foods amounted to NT$680 million a
year.</P>
      <P>Asked why they wanted to buy medicine advertised on unauthorized radio stations,
most of the respondents said "it sounded good" for their health.</P>
      <P>Liao Chi-chou, director of BPA, said that most of people buy these unapproved
Chinese herbal products or health foods believing that "they have fewer side
effects" than chemical medicines.</P>
      <P>As middle-aged and elderly people constitute the majority of buyers of
unapproved medicines -- many of whom already have some chronic illness --  Liao
warned that procuring medicines from unidentified sources poses a great threat,
especially to the health of the liver and kidneys, with dialysis being required
in some serious cases.</P>
      <P>Liao stressed that the it is illegal to advertise medicines on any radio

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has tentatively decided to ease restrictions on foreign
professionals applying to work in Taiwan and will introduce new categories of
visas and work permits to accommodate them, an economic planner said Thursday.</P>
      <P>But Thomas Yeh, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), said the introduction of some new measures will involve a
revision of administrative regulations so that there is no definite timetable
for implementation.</P>
      <P>According to the measures passed by the Economics and Finance Committee under
the Executive Yuan Wednesday, the government will streamline the complicated
application process for foreign professionals and academics coming to Taiwan to
work or for scholarly exchanges.</P>
      <P>Under the new measures, the government will allow multiple entries over a period
of up to three years for prominent academics and business leaders of
international stature.</P>
      <P>Presently, Taiwan only issues courtesy visas based on diplomatic considerations.
People of international standing who visit Taiwan to give lectures or to provide
technological expertise are usually given single-entry visas. If they wish to
remain in Taiwan for more than 14 days, they have to apply to the Council of
Labor Affairs for a work permit, a regulation that is said to have caused
trouble for some foreign professionals.</P>
      <P>The Economics and Finance Committee said it has therefore adopted the new
measures proposed by the CEPD to attract more foreign professionals to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But whether Chinese professionals would also be included under the new plan is
yet to be determined, the committee said.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the council has invited relevant government agencies to discuss
the issue and has examined similar regulations in the United States, the
European Union, Singapore and South Korea.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that the National Immigration Agency under the Ministry of the
Interior will serve as a one-stop service center for foreign professionals
intending to come to Taiwan for work or visit," Yeh added.</P>
      <P>He noted that the government will issue non-employment "academic or business
travel cards" to prominent academics, such as Nobel laureates and to business
leaders recommended by foreign trade associations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the case of foreign professionals who have been recruited by the government
to work in Taiwan, they will be issued "work visa cards," which will be a
combination of work permit, alien resident certificate and reentry permit, Yeh
explained.</P>
      <P>The government will also issue "permanent alien residence cards" to those
foreign investors and professionals, he said.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that except for the "permanent alien residence card," which should be
ready by the end of June, the introduction of the academic, business travel and
work visa cards will involve a revision of administrative regulations, and that
there is no timetable for implementation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation (TCF) reaffirmed Thursday its
determination to continue tackling the effects of greenhouse gasses, and urged
that all Taiwan people work to reduce carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>The TCF, which has some 4,500 recycling stations around Taiwan, made the appeal
with the aim of encouraging the public to reduce carbon emissions through
everyday practices, in recognition of April 22 Earth Day.</P>
      <P>Noting that the soaring food prices, severe climate changes, and rising sea
level are the results of commercial activities, Hsieh Ching-kuei, director of
the Religious Cultural and Humanitarian Department at the TCF, said "this is an
urgent task that we must face and deal with immediately."</P>
      <P>Based on the teachings of Master Cheng Yen who founded the TCF in 1966 and has
been devoted to environmental protection for more than 20 years, Hsieh suggested
that through consumption of vegetarian food and energy saving measures, "carbon
emissions can be easily reduced."</P>
      <P>Speaking exclusively to the CNA, Hsieh said he was proud of his achievement of
reducing carbon emissions by at least 1 ton a year by cycling and taking public
transportation instead of driving his own car.</P>
      <P>"We also need to reduce our consumption of unnecessary items, to reuse
materials, and to recycle resources and make our life simpler, which indeed
would help to reduce carbon emissions," Hsieh stressed.</P>
      <P>Amid concern that Taiwan's carbon emissions are increasing rapidly compared to
Japan and the European countries, Shaw Liu, director of the Research Center for
Environmental Changes at Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top research institution,
said "if we don't act to reduce carbon emissions, a massive extinction of
species may occur soon."</P>
      <P>In line with Master Cheng Yen's teachings, Wei Chuan Foods Corporation (WCFC),
one of Taiwan's main food manufacturers and processors, also launched an
internal campaign to reduce carbon emissions, WCFC Chairman Wei Ying-chung said.</P>
      <P>According to Wei, the WCFC has cut carbon emissions by 2,500 tons over the past
six months through the use of environmental friendly materials and by asking its
employees and their families to save energy.</P>
      <P>"We hope that other corporations nationwide can practice energy saving measures
to help save the earth," Wei said.</P>

      <P>The campaign office of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that Ma and
his campaign team are open to the notion that the Presidential Office be
relocated to Guandu, a plain to the west of Taipei City near the foot of
Yangmingshan that has been undeveloped for many years.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-chiang, spokesman for Ma's campaign office, said that after Ma is
inaugurated May 20, he will solicit opinions from the public via open debate on
the relocation issue.</P>
      <P>Ma reportedly said Thursday during a visit to Chen Fang-ming, director of the
Graduate Institute for Taiwanese Literature at National Chengchi University,
that he intends to relocate the Presidential Office -- a facility of
Renaissance-style architecture built during Japan's occupation of Taiwan -- and
other Cabinet agencies to the Guandu Plain after he takes office.</P>
      <P>Ma told Chen about his intention after the academic proposed to the president-
elect that when he seeks to address "transitional justice" issue after he
becomes head of state, he should also address the historical issues that have
been left in Taiwan since the end of the Japanese colonial rules.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, main opposition Kuomintang Legislator Ting Shou-chung welcomed the
notion that the Presidential Office and other government agencies could be
relocated.</P>
      <P>Ting, whose constituencies include Guandu and the nearby Beitou, said the
relocation plan could start a "turnaround of Taipei's axis," under which the
Guandu Plain could be developed into a second Taipei downtown area, giving the
city a completely new face.</P>
      <P>Ting said development of the Guandu plain would not be an ecological nightmare
and quoted Hsia Chu-joe, director of the Graduate Institute of Building and
Planning of National Taiwan University, as having said that the plain could not
only be developed into the "lungs" of Taipei, but could also be developed into
the "backyard"  of Taipei,  should proper environmentally  friendly procedures
be adopted during development.</P>
      <P>The development would also benefit farmers living on the plain, Ting added.</P>

      <P>Southern Taiwan's Tainan city is the first city in Taiwan to adopt such a
measure when it put its anti-idling policy into effect on Jan. 1, 2008.</P>
      <P>Under Tainan's policy, motorists of cars and other vehicles, including
motorcycles, must turn off their engine when they stop for more than three
minutes, otherwise the drivers will be fined NT$500 to NT$2,000.</P>
      <P>Taichung City's policy will be similar, but the fines will be much higher.</P>
      <P>If a driver in Taichung does not turn off his engine when he has stopped for
three minutes or longer, he will be fined NT$5,000 to NT$10,000, according to a
Taichung City Environmental Protection Bureau official who declined to be named.</P>
      <P>Under the first stage of Taichung's program, which will begin in July 2008, only
vehicles involved in for-profit business will be required to follow the rule,
but by the second stage of the program which will begin in October, all vehicles
will have to comply with the regulation.</P>
      <P>The bureau began trying to raise public awareness about the new policy in April
and up to now, it has heard no complaints from the public, said the official to
CNA reporter in a phone interview.</P>
      <P>While authorities in local governments make efforts to reduce greenhouse  gas
emission  by banning  engine idling,  Taiwan's Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) has no plan to ban vehicle idling nationwide, said on the
phone Hsiao Hui-chuan, director of the EPA's air quality protection and noise
control section.</P>
      <P>"The EPA's actual objective is to enhance education for people, " Hsiao said,
adding that it is possible to integrate the anti-idling policy into national law
in the future if the two cities' pilot measures prove successful.</P>
      <P>In Tainan, where the policy has been implemented for more than four months, no
violations have been recorded so far, said the an official from the city's
environmental protection bureau,  who declined to be named.</P>
      <P>"Even though some people complain that the three-minute time limit is too short,
and that in the summer it is too hot to stay in a car without turning on the air
conditioner, more than 90 percent of the citizens understand and support the
policy, " said the official on the phone.</P>
      <P>Asked why the bureau set the time limit to three minutes, she said the bureau
took into consideration policies in other countries and regions, including Hong
Kong, Singapore, Japan and the United States, adding that the time limit in
Taiwan is reasonable.</P>
      <P>According to the Tainan bureau, a vehicle emits more air pollutants when idling
than running, and the CO2 emission of 100 idling vehicles equals to that of
10,000 running ones.</P>
      <P>To encourage people to follow the regulation, the Tainan bureau also noted that
they can save about 640 litres of gasoline per year by reducing 30 minutes of
idling per day. That is about NT$18,000 per year saved and 1.4 tons of CO2
emission reduced, the bureau said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP recruiting young members with technology</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  launched a recruitment campaign
Thursday using Internet technology such as YouTube to attract younger people to
join the party.</P>
      <P>YouTube is a video-sharing Web site that enables users to upload, view and share
video clips, and has gained massive popularity worldwide since its creation in
2005.</P>
      <P>The DPP project, titled "We Want You," allows the public not only to view video
commercials presented by young DPP officials on YouTube but also to receive the
party's profile, as well as to register with the party online.</P>
      <P>Chou Yung-hong, director of the DPP's Department of Youth Development, said that
promoting the DPP through the Internet "helps inspire the `geeks' who rarely
stay in touch with politics but would nevertheless like the opportunity to
participate."</P>
      <P>Noting that only about 16 percent of some the party's 400,000 members are aged
under 35, DPP acting Chairman Frank Hsieh said at the launch ceremony that "we
look forward to greater support from young people" to make the DPP more
diversified.</P>
      <P>Hsieh added that while a political party popular among younger generations will
not necessarily win the support of the majority, "young  people  bring the party
a better  and more promising perspective."</P>
      <P>"We hope young people who are adventurous  and eager for innovation will join us
... and that the DPP can serve as a platform from which they can speak out,"
Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP lost the March 22 presidential election and will become  the
opposition  after  President-elect  Ma  Ying-jeou, representing the Kuomintang,
takes office May 20, Hsieh encouraged new blood wanting to join the DPP "to
surprise the government and make changes in Taiwanese society together."</P>
      <P>Chou further urged people aged between 18 and 35 to watch the DPP's commercials
on the Internet to learn more about the party and to complete the online
application online, adding that the party hopes to recruit 2,000 to 3,000 new
members through the campaign.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A grand inauguration ceremony was held Thursday for the Kaohsiung mass rapid
transit (MRT) system's Red Line which has been in commercial operation since
April 7 following a one-month test run.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, who presided over the ceremony, said at the occasion
that the Kaohsiung MRT system plays a crucial role in ensuring a promising
future for the southern port city.</P>
      <P>Lu said she is proud of Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu for eventually putting
into operation the Red Line, which initially saw many setbacks.</P>
      <P>Chen said the system has brought revolutionary changes to the city, was
providing a more convenient form of transportation, boosting real estate market,
and contributing to improved air quality as it offers an alternative to cars and
buses.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed the hope that the central government will support an extension of
the city's MRT system into the neighboring Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. Chairman Lin Wen-
yuan apologized to the residents living near the line for the inconveniences
they had to endure  during  its construction, and thanked all those who were
involved in the construction and had made great contributions to the project.</P>
      <P>The system's Red Line started operation with a test run March 9 this year.
Nearly 8 million passengers were able to ride the trains free of cost during the
test period, prior to April 7 when charges went into effect.</P>
      <P>The 28.3-km Red Line extends north-south and some of its 24 stations feature
public installation art designed to present specific aspects of the city's
culture and history.</P>
      <P>Chairman Lin also announced at the ceremony that the other main line -- the
Orange Line -- is slated to begin operation in August this year.</P>
      <P>Construction of the 14.4-km Orange Line, which runs east to west and has 14
stations, will be completed ahead of schedule in August instead of October, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City is the second metropolis in Taiwan to build an MRT system after
Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The KRTC is being constructed under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract
signed with the Kaohsiung City government, at a total cost of NT$181.3 billion
(US$5.89 billion) . The project was approved by the Kaohsiung city council in
1999, but was rocked by number of construction accidents and corruption scandals
after work began in October 2001.</P>
      <P>A number of minor lines are also planned -- blue, brown, yellow, green -- as
well as a light rail, with the completion of the entire MRT network scheduled
for 2021.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Nobel Prize winner says his theory applies to cross-strait relations</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2007 Economics Nobel Prize laureate, Eric S. Maskin, said Thursday his
theory on how to predict the outcome of a situation involving different players
is applicable to the cross-strait situation between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>While giving a speech in Taipei, the mathematician from Princeton University in
the United States focused on his lifelong work -Evolution and Repeated Games - a
theory which explains how a player within a game situation could break the ice.</P>
      <P>Citing his theory, Maskin said any of the two parties in a game, who fail to
cooperate with each other, could evolve in a way that leads to a change in the
situation.</P>
      <P>Responding to media inquiries about how his theory can be applied to help solve
the situation between Taiwan and China, Maskin said as a mathematician, he could
only explain the theoretical mechanism instead of predicting actual results, but
ensured that his theory is applicable to still unresolved disputes across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"You can use the theory to predict the result or outcome of any game situation
that involves more than one player,he noted.</P>
      <P>The 57-year-old American scholar, who recently attended the Boao Forum for Asia,
arrived in Taipei Thursday and is scheduled to share his theory and inspirations
at a roundtable seminar Friday on solving the cross-strait  stalemate.  The
forum  will be attended  by President-elect Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Maskin's speeches are part of a two-day forum co-organized by the global
investment company Allianz, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research and
the Economic Daily News local paper.</P>
      <P>He will also be exchanging ideas with Udo Frank, CEO of Allianz RCM Global
Advisors; Douglas Hsu, chairman of Far Eastern Group; and Daigee Shaw, the
president of Chung-Hua Institution.</P>
      <P>Maskin won the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences along with Leonid
Hurwicz and Roger Myerson, for establishing the foundations ofmechanism design
theory, a study of designing rules of a game or system to achieve a specific
outcome.</P>
      <P>Initiated in the 1960s by Hurwicz, the mechanism design theory combines the
application of game theories and social choice theory, and is considered the
most notable economic theory on the study of information asymmetry.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hsieh Fa-ta promised Thursday to overhaul
state-run  companies after lawmakers found in a screening session that they
posted combined business losses of some NT$6.02 billion (US$198.84 million) in
2006.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks after lawmakers discovered the extent to which government
enterprises were in the red when reviewing the central government's income and
expenditure in 2006 at a meeting in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The state-run companies under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) include
CPC Corp. Taiwan, Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. and Taiwan Power
Company (Taipower), among others.</P>
      <P>CPC -- Taiwan's largest oil and fuel refiner -- registered the largest  deficit
of NT$13.9 billion.  Of all the state-owned MOEA-affiliated businesses,  Taiwan
Water Corp.,  was the sole profitable company for that year.</P>
      <P>Apart from taking cost-effective measures, Hsieh ascribed the CPC Corp. and
Taipower deficits to a government order freezing a cap on their product prices
amid rising production costs due to surging prices of raw materials.</P>
      <P>Although  the Executive  Yuan has insisted that water and electricity fees be
maintained at their current levels prior to May 20, when President-elect Ma
Ying-jeou will be sworn in, it has been reported that some state-owned companies
have nevertheless been studying the feasibility of price hikes in the near term
to reflect their increased operating costs.</P>

      <P>The Public Health Bureau of northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County on Thursday
confirmed the county's first enterovirus case this year, saying that the
patient, an 18-month-old child, is out of danger after undergoing treatment in
the past week.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsueh-jung, a staff member of the bureau, said the boy developed a fever on
April 6, coupled with a rash and high blood pressure, and that his condition did
not improve despite treatment in a clinic near his home.</P>
      <P>The boy was then referred to a hospital on April 9 and stayed in an intensive
care unit, where his condition stabilized several days later.</P>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control has confirmed that the child contracted
Enterovirus Type 71 (EV 71) , a fatal enterovirus strain that has spread to
Taiwan from other Southeast Asian countries, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>With the new enterovirus case, the accumulated total number of confirmed cases
in Taiwan this year has increased to 37, of which most were EV 71 cases, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Hou Sheng-mou, head of the Cabinet-level Department of Health, warned last month
that children in Taiwan have a relatively low degree of immunity against the
disease because Taiwan has not suffered an enterovirus epidemic for the past two
years.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus is a common cause of diseases such as meningitis and myocarditis.
The flu-like illness is usually contracted through direct contact with
contaminated sources.</P>
      <P>The virus enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract, where it thrives,
and can move on to attack the nervous system. Children are more susceptible to
the infection than healthy adults.</P>
      <P>No vaccine  is available  to curb the virus and frequent hand-washing is still
the most effective way to prevent infection.</P>

      <P>A group of primary school students from disadvantaged families in the
northeastern county of Yilan have had a dream come true with a visit to
Singapore, funded by money they earned selling home-made specialty foods over
the past six months.</P>
      <P>"We are so happy that we have finally traveled overseas to Singapore," said 37
fifth-graders from the Hsin Nan Elementary School in Yilan's Chuangwei township
during a Wednesday meeting with Kuo Shih-nan, Taiwan's representative to
Singapore.</P>
      <P>The children were scheduled to visit Singapore's Hong Wen Primary School, where
they were to demonstrate their talents and skills in riding unicycles, diabolo
juggling and martial arts and gymnastics the next day.</P>
      <P>The children also took with them four unicycles to give to the Singaporean
school as a token of friendship.</P>
      <P>Kuo, himself an Yilan native, said he was moved by the students' efforts to
realize their dreams.</P>
      <P>The students wanted to visit other countries after meeting with their peers from
Singapore and Hong Kong during school exchange events a few years ago, said Hsu
Pao-yin, a teacher in charge of the group.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that most of the students come from either single-parent families or
financially disadvantaged ones and that it was a "mission impossible" for each
student to raise the more-than NT$20,000 (about US$661) cost of the four-day
trip.</P>
      <P>To make their dreams come true, the school and parents helped the students
launch a drive to raise funds for the trip by selling home-made preserves,
candies and cookies on weekends and holidays, Hsu went on.</P>
      <P>The students raised nearly NT$300,000 in six months, with the shortfall made up
by the students, the Yilan county government, county councilors and from public
donations, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the fund-raising has taught the students the importance of working hard
to achieve their dreams and she added that the students have vowed to help
others when they grow up.</P>
      <P>To help other students travel overseas in the future, the school's principal,

      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) is revising laws to deal with the problem
of foreign spouses of Taiwanese nationals who overstay their residency permits,
an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>NIA Director-General Wu Chen-chi made the remarks at the Home and Nations
Committee of the legislature in response to questions by opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) lawmaker Chao Erh-chung.</P>
      <P>Chao criticized as inhumane the immigration laws that stipulate that foreign
spouses of Taiwan citizens should return to their home countries before they
apply for re-entry to Taiwan when they overstay their residency permits.</P>
      <P>Chao cited a case of a foreign spouse living in the offshore island of Kinmen,
who was ordered to return to her home country for one year before she can apply
for re-entry to Taiwan because she overstayed her residency permit for one year.</P>
      <P>Another case occurred on the outlying island of Matsu, involving a spouse who
was "relatively luckier" than the first case as the NIA asked her to leave
Taiwan for a short period time before she applied for re-entry as she only
overstayed her residency permit for three months.</P>
      <P>Chao noted that demanding foreign spouses of Taiwanese citizens to leave Taiwan
before they apply for re-entry is a practice that dates back to the period when
Taiwan was still under martial law.</P>
      <P>"Such  a formality  is inhumane  and has caused  so much inconvenience to the
foreign spouses of Taiwanese as some of them just forgot to apply for the
extension of their residency permits, " Chao said.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu noted that there are indeed many foreign spouses of local
citizens who do not know they should apply for an extension of their residency
permits or who do not know when their permits expire.</P>
      <P>"The NIA has been trying to revise the immigration rules to impose a fine on
foreign spouses who overstay their permits or allow an afterward application
instead of asking them to leave the country before they apply for a re-entry,"
Wu said.</P>
      <P>However, he did not elaborate when the new immigration rules will be in place.</P>

      <P>A new association  of biomedical engineering and electronics was established
Thursday at Hsinchu-based National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) as a cooperative
platform upon which experts from different fields can promote the development of
Taiwan's biomedical industry.</P>
      <P>NCTU President Wu Chung-yu, who first broached the idea of the association, said
the biomedical industry is a relatively new sector in Taiwan and needs more
efforts to foster it as the next "trillion dollar industry" -- a term used to
describe those industries that are capable of achieving annual revenues of NT$1
trillion or above.</P>
      <P>Describing the establishment of the association as "a first step and a good
start, " Wu expressed hope that the organization can become an interdisciplinary
platform for biomedicine, engineering, electronics, technology-related
legislation and venture capital for the industry.</P>
      <P>He also said the association will help strengthen the local biomedical  industry
through  international  cooperation  and collaborative research projects on
technology and application.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-tai, honorary director of NCTU's Intelligent Prosthesis Research Center,
said the biomedical industry can be separated into three  sub-sectors  --
biomedical  pharmaceuticals,  biomedical components and diagnostic instruments.</P>
      <P>Liu explained that Taiwan has encountered difficulties developing the biomedical
pharmaceutical industry because domestic companies lack key genetic  engineering
technology  and because  ethnic distribution in Taiwan is relatively less
diversified, which makes it difficult to conduct cross-racial experiments.</P>
      <P>"However, " Wu said, "Taiwan still has potential in developing biomedical
components and diagnostic instruments based on the fact that the country has a
strong electronics sector and a world-class information industry."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hong Kong eyeing Taiwan tourists prior to direct cross-strait links</HEADLINE>

      <P>In an effort to seize as many business opportunities as possible prior to the
planned opening of direct weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China, Hong
Kong tourism operators will be represented at a travel fair next week in the
central city of Taichung, offering economy package tours to lure Taiwanese
visitors.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong Tourism Board will showcase their products -- joint ventures with
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., Dragonair Hong Kong and a dozen Taichung-based tour
agencies -- to lure Taiwanese visitors at four booths in the Taichung
International Travel Fair 2008, to be inaugurated April 25 at the World Trade
Center Taichung.</P>
      <P>According to a Hong Kong Tourism Board manager, there are currently 39 direct
flights from Chingchuankang Airport in suburban Taichung to Hong Kong every
week. The drive from Taichung to the airport is 90 minutes shorter than the
drive from Taichung to Taipei.</P>
      <P>In addition, the manager said, prices of the various three-day trips to Hong
Kong to be offered at the fair for individual travelers are even cheaper than
domestic travel in Taiwan -- ranging from NT$4,999 (US$165) to NT$16,888.</P>
      <P>For parents and children on group tours to Hong Kong Disney Land Magic World, a
three-day package tour costs between NT$13,888 and NT$15,888, she went on.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong has long been the major transshipment  hub for cross-Taiwan Strait
flights due to the lack of direct air links between Taiwan and China, but the
former British colony might soon lose this key advantage after direct transport
services are set up between the two sides of the strait, hopefully starting in
early July with weekend charter flights.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who will assume the presidency May 20, vowed to
implement the measure throughout his election campaign.</P>

      <P>A life insurance policy offering a preferential rate for people who are healthy
non-smokers was approved Thursday by the Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC).</P>
      <P>FSC officials said the term life insurance policy offered by Nan Shan Life --
the Taiwan operation of insurance giant AIG -- is the first of its kind on the
island.</P>
      <P>Under the program, non-smoking policy holders are entitled to lower premiums
than those who smoke, even if they are of the same age and gender.</P>
      <P>The commission's approval was aimed at encouraging insurance companies to
provide more life insurance policies that champion health awareness and
encourage smokers to kick their habit, FSC officials said.</P>
      <P>Similar policies offered by three other insurance companies, namely Prudential,
Mass Mutual Mercuries Life and Shin Kong Life, are presently in the process of
being screened, the officials added.</P>
      <P>There are an estimated of 4.5 million smokers in Taiwan, which represents one-
fifth of the nation's population.</P>

      <P>The Water Resources Agency on Thursday invited the public to hike in northern
Taiwan and bike in southern Taiwan this weekend to appreciate the island's
rivers and see the government's efforts in river dredging.</P>
      <P>Hiking excursions will take place along the Keelung River in northern Taiwan's
Keelung City on April 19, and biking activities will be held along the Puzih
River in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County on April 20, according to an official
at the agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The two activities, co-organized by the agency and the two local governments,
are being planned to celebrate World Earth Day, which falls on April 22.</P>
      <P>They are also part of a series of annual activities arranged by the government
to arouse the public's awareness about Taiwan's river ecology, the official said
in a statement.</P>
      <P>Participants will be able to see beautiful scenery along the two rivers and
learn more about the rivers' ecology and dredging projects from experts in the
field, said the official.</P>
      <P>There will also be lessons on how to make organic soaps to encourage
participants to use organic cleaning products, instead of synthetic ones in
daily life, to protect rivers, the official said, adding that the public's
participation is an important link in river ecology protection.</P>
      <P>Since 2002, the central government has spent seven years dredging the 59-km
Keelung River, which used to cause serious floods during the typhoon season.</P>
      <P>Channelizing and tree planting in the past seven years has brought a totally new
look to the river, which runs through Taipei City, Taipei County, and Keelung
City, the official said.</P>
      <P>Dredging in the Puzih river is another success story, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The government spent the past seven years cleaning the 75-km river that had
serious pollution problems. Major efforts were carried out to find sources of
waste water, cut off pollutants, and evaluate water quality.</P>
      <P>Now the river has turned into a clean and beautiful one, and it is no longer
referred to by its former title -- "black river, " said an official at the
Chiayi County government.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first sports lottery will kick off May 2, yielding an estimated NT$1.07
billion (US$354 million) in revenue for this year, a spokesman for the issuing
bank said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The annual revenue will have grown to NT$30 billion by the start of 2009,
predicted Richard Yang, vice president of Taipei Fubon Bank, which also operated
the country's public welfare lottery for five years until 2006.</P>
      <P>Half of the bank's 200 designated retailers will begin selling sports lottery
tickets on the first day, Yang said, adding that the number of designated
retailers will have increased to 1,000 by June.</P>
      <P>In addition, the bank will inaugurate an online betting system in mid-June, Yang
said.</P>
      <P>Citing the examples of Hong Kong and Singapore, Yang noted that the online
system is expected to contribute 40 percent of the total revenue when people
know how to place bets on the Internet or via telephone.</P>
      <P>In the first year, however, retailers will still account for the bulk of the
revenue, he went on.</P>
      <P>Saying that the online system will not eat into retailers' profits, Yang
explained that each of the 1,000 retailers is expected to generate some NT$18
million on average, which is higher than the average profit of NT$11 million
posted by the bank's previous public lottery ticket retailers.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the sports lottery will focus on NBA basketball and Major
League Baseball in the United States, as well as on the Union of European
Football Associations, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>The sports lottery will also cover local baseball and basketball, Yang
continued, adding that local residents will be allowed to bet on local baseball
games from mid-August.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Fubon Bank -- a subsidiary of Fubon Financial Holding Co., Taiwan's

      <P>The government offers subsidies to help local governments export farm produce to
the world, not just China, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said in a press
release Thursday.</P>
      <P>The statement was issued soon after a local newspaper reported that the council
recently shifted its stance to offer a maximum of NT$16 million (US$528,160) to
subsidize local governments to sell agricultural products to China.</P>
      <P>However, the statement said the council began providing the subsidies last year
and that most of the eight subsidized counties -- Taipei, Miaoli, Taichung,
Yunlin, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Hualien -- have focused on exporting to
Japan, Singapore and Canada.</P>
      <P>Only a few of them targeted China, the statement added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the council explained in the statement that it did not specifically
exclude any market from its subsidy list.</P>
      <P>This year, the council will subsidize another eight counties -- Taipei, Taoyuan,
Taichung, Yunlin, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Hualien -- and only Taipei and
Yunlin have selected China as their export market in their applications, the
statement went on.</P>
      <P>In assisting agricultural exports to China, the council attaches greater
importance to protecting the know-how, brand image and trademark  of Taiwan's
quality farm produce because Taiwanese agricultural products are often
counterfeited in China, according to the statement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President says Taiwan's future should be decided by residents</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tapei,  April 17 (CNA)
04/17/08  23:41:30
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Restating that China and Taiwan are two separate countries, President Chen Shui-
bian said Thursday that only the 23 million inhabitants of Taiwan have the right
to decide the future of their island.</P>
      <P>In a clear rejection of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's recent overture to China,
Chen also said that shelving the dispute over Taiwan's sovereignty amounts to "a
de facto shelving of (Taiwan's) sovereignty" itself.</P>
      <P>Speaking to foreign participants in a conference on Taiwan's sovereign status,
the outgoing president denied the efficacy of both the 1943 Cairo Declaration
and the 1945 Potsdam Declaration, which have been interpreted by some as
acknowledging China's sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"These declarations were merely... unilateral policy statements," Chen said. The
president will hand over power to Ma May 20 after serving two four-year terms.</P>
      <P>The San Francisco Peace Treaty, which took effect in 1952, takes precedence over
both the earlier declarations, said Chen, adding that the treaty does not
mention which country can claim sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Rounding off his remarks, Chen summed up his stance regarding Taiwan's sovereign
status with the following four main points:</P>
      <P>First, Taiwan's sovereignty should be based on self-determination by its
populace and on the principle of popular sovereignty, while neither the Cairo
Declaration nor the Potsdam Declaration should be employed to constrain the
destiny of the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Second, Taiwan, regardless of its title -- no matter whether it is called
"Taiwan" or the "Republic of China" -- is a sovereign state, with its
sovereignty held in the hands of its people and only by them. Nobody else is
entitled to determine the country's future.</P>
      <P>Third, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are two separate countries -- Taiwan
and China, or the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China -- which
are independent of each other and do not belong to each other. They are not part
of a divided, separately ruled China.</P>
      <P>Fourth, any normalization of cross-strait relations should be carried out under
the tenets of the four principles of "sovereignty, democracy, peace and parity."
As far as the sovereignty dispute is concerned, self-restraint and self-
deprecation are not tolerable because adopting such stances would eventually
lead to the shelving and abandonment of sovereignty.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou will evaluate the feasibility of relocating the
Presidential Office in downtown Taipei to the Guandu plain in the city's
northern area after he assumes office May 20, a local academic said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Fang-ming, head of the Graduate Institute for Taiwanese Literature at
National Chengchi University, made the revelation after an 80-minute meeting
with Ma at his office.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Chen said, he mentioned that the pursuit of transitional
justice should include a review of the legacies of Taiwan's colonial era, not
just setting the record straight on the Kuomintang's  authoritarian  past as
pursued  by the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party administration over the
past few years.</P>
      <P>When it comes to historical issues regarding Japanese colonial rule, Chen went
on, the fate of the building that has housed the Republic of China's
Presidential Office since 1950 should not be overlooked.</P>
      <P>The Baroque-style building in downtown Taipei was completed in 1919 to house the
then-Japanese colonial government.</P>
      <P>It became a target of U.S. bombing in the latter years of World War II and was
partially destroyed in 1945, with repair work not completed until 1948. After
the ROC government moved its seat from China to Taiwan in 1949, the building
became the Presidential Office in 1950.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chen's suggestion, Ma was quoted as having said that during his
tenure as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006, he had tried to sort out the most
appropriate way to transform the Presidential Office building in tandem with
Taiwan's progress into a democratic era.</P>
      <P>"Ma told me that after he takes office, he is likely to come up with a plan to
relocate the Presidential Office to Guandu Plain," Chen told reporters after his
closed-door meeting with Ma.</P>
      <P>Ma visited Chen to show his determination to promote social reconciliation and
harmony in the wake of the bitterly contested presidential election. Chen
supported Ma's rival, Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, in
the March 22 poll.</P>
      <P>Thanks to a good chemistry between them, the Ma-Chen meeting lasted much longer
than originally scheduled. Ma told reporters after the meeting that he admires
Chen's dedication to study of Taiwanese culture and literature as well as his
achievements in Taiwan's localization discourse.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Agricultural export subsidies focus on world markets: COA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government offers subsidies to help local governments export farm produce to
the world, not just China, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said in a press
release Thursday.</P>
      <P>The statement was issued soon after a local newspaper reported that the council
recently shifted its stance to offer a maximum of NT$16 million (US$528,160) to
subsidize local governments to sell agricultural products to China.</P>
      <P>However, the statement said the council began providing the subsidies last year
and that most of the eight subsidized counties -- Taipei, Miaoli, Taichung,
Yunlin, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Hualien -- have focused on exporting to
Japan, Singapore and Canada.</P>
      <P>Only a few of them targeted China, the statement added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the council explained in the statement that it did not specifically
exclude any market from its subsidy list.</P>
      <P>This year, the council will subsidize another eight counties -- Taipei, Taoyuan,
Taichung, Yunlin, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Hualien -- and only Taipei and
Yunlin have selected China as their export market in their applications, the
statement went on.</P>
      <P>In assisting agricultural exports to China, the council attaches greater
importance to protecting the know-how, brand image and trademark  of Taiwan's
quality farm produce because Taiwanese agricultural products are often
counterfeited in China, according to the statement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President-elect said mulling relocation of Presidential Office</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 17 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou will evaluate the feasibility of relocating the
Presidential Office in downtown Taipei to the Guandu plain in the city's
northern area after he assumes office May 20, a local academic said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Fang-ming, head of the Graduate Institute for Taiwanese Literature at
National Chengchi University, made the revelation after an 80-minute meeting
with Ma at his office.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Chen said, he mentioned that the pursuit of transitional
justice should include a review of the legacies of Taiwan's colonial era, not
just setting the record straight on the Kuomintang's  authoritarian  past as
pursued  by the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party administration over the
past few years.</P>
      <P>When it comes to historical issues regarding Japanese colonial rule, Chen went
on, the fate of the building that has housed the Republic of China's
Presidential Office since 1950 should not be overlooked.</P>
      <P>The Baroque-style building in downtown Taipei was completed in 1919 to house the
then-Japanese colonial government.</P>
      <P>It became a target of U.S. bombing in the latter years of World War II and was
partially destroyed in 1945, with repair work not completed until 1948. After
the ROC government moved its seat from China to Taiwan in 1949, the building
became the Presidential Office in 1950.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chen's suggestion, Ma was quoted as having said that during his
tenure as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006, he had tried to sort out the most
appropriate way to transform the Presidential Office building in tandem with
Taiwan's progress into a democratic era.</P>
      <P>"Ma told me that after he takes office, he is likely to come up with a plan to
relocate the Presidential Office to Guandu Plain," Chen told reporters after his
closed-door meeting with Ma.</P>
      <P>Ma visited Chen to show his determination to promote social reconciliation and
harmony in the wake of the bitterly contested presidential election. Chen
supported Ma's rival, Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, in
the March 22 poll.</P>
      <P>Thanks to a good chemistry between them, the Ma-Chen meeting lasted much longer
than originally scheduled. Ma told reporters after the meeting that he admires
Chen's dedication to study of Taiwanese culture and literature as well as his
achievements in Taiwan's localization discourse.</P>

      <P>The volume of text messages sent by Taiwan mobile phone users posted a year-on-
year increase of 26 percent to reach 1.256 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007
as mobile phone subscriptions continued to rise, according to a report released
Friday by the Institute for Information Industry (III).</P>
      <P>The volume, representing a growth of 9 percent compared with the previous
quarter, translated into each person sending an average 54.7 text messages per
quarter and 18.2 text messages per month.</P>
      <P>For the fourth quarter of 2007, the monthly text message volume averaged 419
million, while in December alone, the volume hit a record single-month high of
460 million, thanks to the increasingly popular practice of sending Christmas or
New Year greetings via text messaging, the report said.</P>
      <P>The number of mobile phone subscriptions jumped 1.3 percent quarter-on-quarter
to hit 24.3 million for the period, with the mobile phone subscriptions per 100
inhabitants standing at 105.8.</P>
      <P>Mobile  Internet  subscriptions   climbed  7.8  percent quarter-on-quarter to
reach 11.86 million -- equal to half the number of Taiwan's population, meaning
that 48.8 percent of mobile phone subscriptions were registered with mobile
Internet services.</P>
      <P>The report also noted that mobile phone users in Taiwan were gradually dumping
2G networks for 3G networks.</P>
      <P>While  2G  network  subscriptions  declined  4.2  percent quarter-on-quarter to
15.9 million, 3G network subscriptions rose 16.5 percent to 6.91 million,
accounting for 28.5 percent of total mobile phone subscriptions.</P>
      <P>With 3G network subscriptions having increased at a rate of 3.2-3.8 percent per
quarter, the III predicted that the number will top 10 million by the end of
2008 to account for 40 percent of total mobile phone subscriptions.</P>
      <P>In terms of mobile Internet technologies, 55.1 percent of mobile Internet users
went online through a 3G network, compared with 32 percent who accessed the
Internet through general packet radio services (GPRS) , indicating that 3G was
replacing GPRS as the mainstream technology for mobile Internet connection.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT's win does not represent loss of Taiwan-centric line: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  17 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The decisive victory of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in the March 22
presidential election represented a victory for everyone in Taiwan but not a
defeat of the Taiwan-centric political line, a high-ranking Taiwanese official
said Thursday at the Taiwanese American Center in New York.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese identity and Taiwan-centric consciousness have become a consensus and
common language in the country since the election, " said Tung Chen-yuan, vice
chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , who is currently
on a speaking tour of the United States.</P>
      <P>"The KMT owed its victory partly to its tilting toward the Taiwan-centric
advocacy that has been championed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP)," Tung said.</P>
      <P>Tung said the contributions  that outgoing President  Chen Shui-bian  has made
in deepening Taiwan's democratization  and consolidating the Taiwanese identity
are historically undeniable.</P>
      <P>"Chen's efforts have altered the mode of cross-strait relations development and
have also created strategic maneuvering space between the two sides," he went
on.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tung said, the Beijing leadership has ceaselessly adjusted its Taiwan
policies and is "still adjusting, " which he said indicates that Beijing has
also been unable to free itself from the impact of Taiwan's democratic
development.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's democracy is a core asset in cross-strait relations and the
bottom line of cross-strait negotiations, Tung said Beijing has had no other
options but to adjust its stance in the face of Taiwan's democratic progress.</P>
      <P>He said that although Beijing has never openly acknowledged the notion that
"there is only one China but both sides could interpret the meaning separately,
" its stance seems to have changed, according to a March 26 telephone dialogue
between U.S. President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>According to a Beijing-based Xinhua News Agency English-language report on Hu's
conversation with Bush, Hu said "it is China's consistent stand that the Chinese
mainland and Taiwan should restore consultation and talks on the basis of `the
1992 consensus, ' under which "both sides recognize that there is only one
China, but agree to differ on its definition."</P>
      <P>Hu's remarks show that China in a sense will change and will accept the "One
China, differing definitions" notion, Tung said, adding that should China
anticipate any progress in political engagement across the strait, it must face
squarely the fact of the Republic of China's existence on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan cannot afford not to know China better, given that
China is an enemy and Taiwan's closest neighbor.</P>
      <P>Tung suggested that cross-strait relations should be developed under a
"triangular, two-tier" framework -- taking opinions of both Taiwan, China and
the rest of the world into account, while heeding the wills of the people on
either side of the strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yaun completed a preliminary review Friday of a bill that would
raise the mandatory retirement age prescribed in the Labor Standards Act from
the present 60 to 65.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment, which cleared the legislature's Health, Environment and
Labor Affairs Committee, is still pending second and third readings before it
can be signed into law.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Yang Chiung-ying, a lead sponsor of the
bill, said it is necessary to put off the mandatory retirement age of workers to
strengthen the use of middle-aged and elderly human resources because the
average life expectancy in Taiwan has increased to 76 and more older workers are
staying in the labor force rather than retiring.</P>
      <P>The measure is also crucial to cope with the possible impact of the declining
birth rate on the labor force, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Legislators Hsu Shao-ping and Chung Shao-ho, also of the KMT, said the measure
would extend the work rights of local workers, while those who wish to retire
early could still do so voluntarily even after the law is passed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Council of Agriculture develops organic bactericides</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has developed organic bactericides made of
natural plant extracts, with germicidal efficiency reaching 99.9 percent,  no
reported drug resistance in bacteria or negative effects on humans, an
agriculture official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuo-hsiung, director-general of the council's Taiwan Seed Improvement and
Propagation Station in Taichung County, central Taiwan, said the center has
applied for patent rights for the development to facilitate future technology
transfers to the private sector.</P>
      <P>The complex organic bactericides were developed after years of research and
contain many plant extracts with secondary metabolites, which are organic
compounds indirectly generated from normal growth, development or reproduction
of organisms.</P>
      <P>These compounds, such as alkaloids, glycosides, phenols, sterols, and essential
oils, are used by plants as defenses against predators, parasites and diseases,
Chen explained.</P>
      <P>The organic bactericides are effective in combating more than 10 types of fungus
and bacteria, such as rice blast fungus, bacillus cereus and colon bacillus, the
latter of which is used as an indicator in evaluating food sanitation.</P>
      <P>According  to Chen,  due  to Taiwan's  humidity  and high temperatures, crops
are often invaded by bacteria or fungus, both of which also exist in water, air
and food, causing environmental pollution and health risks, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Farmers tend to use chemical ingredients or antibiotics to protect their crops,
but the high frequency and intensive use have caused bacteria and fungi to
develop resistance.</P>
      <P>The development of the organic bactericides is part of the COA's measures to
meet its projected goal of reducing use of chemical germicides by half by 2015.</P>
      <P>Chen said the organic bactericides are qualified to be labeled as environmental
sanitation  ingredients  for  sterilizing  public facilities such as hospitals
and schools, as organic biopesticides to support organic agriculture and as
alternative medicine for medical use.</P>
      <P>The center has the world's leading technology in making the organic bactericides
and will transfer the expertise to the industry after acquiring patent rights,
in the hope of developing more antibacterial products such as pesticides, soaps,
detergents and paper towels, Chen said.</P>

      <P>Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday that he respects  the decision  by
President-elect  Ma Ying-jeou's  campaign  manager  to not seek  a post  in Ma's
administration.</P>
      <P>Liu, who is set to be the next premier when Ma is inaugurated May 20, said he
respects Chan's decision not to be part of the incoming KMT administration and
to instead return to his medical career working at a research hospital run by
Taiwan's largest charity group, the Buddhist Tzu Chi Compassionate Relief
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Liu, however, would not comment on whether Chan's decision to leave after making
commendable contributions to Ma's campaign was the result of behind-the-scenes
struggles involving people who have tried to "position" themselves for a posting
in Ma's new administration.</P>
      <P>The premier-designate noted that he talked with Chan over the telephone Thursday
and told Chan that he will certainly invite him to serve in public offices in
the future if Chan is not opposed to the idea.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Chan, a veteran medical
professional, is capable of serving the country in many ways.</P>
      <P>"We should respect his decision if Chan decides to leave the political arena and
return to his medical career," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Chan declared Thursday that he will not be part of Ma's administration and will
instead join the Tzu Chi charity group after Ma is inaugurated.</P>
      <P>Chan, a former head of the Cabinet-level Department of Health and president of
the private Chi Mei Foundation Medical Center, said in a written statement that
after May 20 he will join the Buddhist Tzu Chi Compassionate Relief Foundation,
answering an invitation extended prior to the March 22 presidential election by
Tzu Chi founder Master Cheng Yen, who called for Chan to devote his later years
to charity.</P>
      <P>In the statement, Chan, 59, who also worked as a surgeon at several leading
medical centers in the United States between 1975 and 1989, said he is glad to
have made some contributions to Ma's campaign and that the country will soon be
under the leadership of an able man who has personal integrity and compassion.</P>
      <P>"I will soon return to the grassroots community to continue my services to
Taiwanese society," Chan said in his statement.</P>
      <P>Chan said he issued the statement in an attempt to calm widespread speculation
that he will be appointed by Ma as a vice premier or a deputy Presidential
Office secretary-general.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese delegation organized by the Tourism Visitors Association held an
exchange activity and banquet Thursday at a New York hotel to promote Taiwan's
tourism.</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation, including representatives of various Taiwanese
airlines, hotels, travel agencies and hospitals, discussed cooperation with
American tourism industry representatives at the gathering. Chang Lee Cheng-
chin, an official from the Tourism Visitors Association, said at the event that
Taiwan offers both tropical and sub-tropical scenery, as well as wonderful
mountain and forest views and kind and friendly people.</P>
      <P>She said these assets should attract American citizens traveling to Asia to
visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although world oil prices and the depreciating U.S. dollar have had a negative
impact on Asian countries' tourism industries, Lee said Taiwan's geography and
culture have special qualities that should draw more tourists from the United
States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Steven T.Y. Kuo-Su, deputy director of the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, introduced a variety of
promotional packages being offered by the bureau under the "Tour Taiwan Years
2008-2009." These include special seasonal packages for first-time arrivals with
the theme of dining and recreational activities.</P>
      <P>Various incentive measures are also being offered to foreign tourists under the
program, including hotel room rates of just US$79 per night for transit
passengers and free gifts for members of tour groups, he went on.</P>
      <P>The members of the delegation, including representatives of various travel
agencies, the Howard Plaza Hotel and China Airlines and EVA Air set up booths at
the gathering to introduce their tour packages and specials.</P>
      <P>Members of various Taiwan medical facilities and hospitals, including Tung's
Taichung Metro Harbor Hospital, also took part in the event to promote Taiwan's
competitive advantages in the area of medical tourism, including high-quality

      <P>The tourism office of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York also
invited many U.S. tourism industry representative to take part in the event to
learn more about Taiwan's attractions, tourist packages and special offers.</P>
      <P>One of the representatives said that more than half of the American tourists who
travel to Asia do so during the summer vacation months of July and August and
she suggested that if Taiwan tourism officials want to attract more U.S.
visitors, they should take seasonal factors into consideration when formulating
incentive packages and special offers.</P>

      <P>The nation's first employment service center for drug addicts who have undergone
methadone treatment was inaugurated in National Cheng Kung University Hospital
in southern Taiwan's Tainan City Friday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Kung University Hospital officials said society is usually reluctant to
accept drug addicts and the center will help them find jobs to facilitate their
return to normal life.</P>
      <P>The center will be jointly run by the hospital, Tainan City government, and
Tainan Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>Similar employment service centers will be set up at Chi Mei Foundation Medical
Center in Tainan County and Tainan Hospital in Tainan City in the future, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>The Tainan Prosecutors Office first promoted the methadone treatment program in
2006 to kick their reliance on heroin with good effect, and the program has
since spread to other parts of the country. Taiwan's Legislative Yuan passed a
law on April 8 to give the treatment a legal basis.</P>
      <P>Cheng Kung University Hospital officials said that between 20 and 30 percent of
drug addicts in Taiwan who have taken part in the alternative treatment program
foot their own bills. In Tainan city, the percentage is about 45 percent.</P>
      <P>For the outpatients in the hospital, the ratio is as high as 70 percent, far
higher than in other cities and counties, officials said.</P>
      <P>There are around 400 drug outpatients in the hospital who have taken part in the
alternative treatment program, and the number is increasing at a speed of
between 10 and 15 per week, hospital officials added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT victory does not mean Taiwan wants to unify with China: scholar</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18 (CNA)
04/18/08  16:32:22
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's decisive victory in the presidential election does
not mean Taiwan's people are gradually moving toward unification with China, and
such an interpretation is "malicious, " a pro-independence scholar said at an
international conference Friday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Some pro-China media and people have intentionally played up the election
result, saying that the majority of Taiwanese people have given up seeking
independence  and will gradually move toward unification with China, " said
Ketagalan Institute Chairman Lee Hong-hsi, without providing any examples.</P>
      <P>"Such an interpretation is malicious, misleading and completely wrong, " he said
at the opening of the International Conference on Taiwan's Sovereign Status.</P>
      <P>KMT candidate Ma Ying-jeou  defeated the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) Frank Hsieh by a bigger-than-expected margin of 2.21 million votes in
the March 22 presidential poll.</P>
      <P>The victory returned the KMT to power eight years after its five decades of
uninterrupted rule in Taiwan ended in 2000.</P>
      <P>Ma vowed during his campaign to build closer ties with China, especially in the
economic realm, an approach that marks a reversal of the DPP's policy over the
past eight years.</P>
      <P>The president-elect has publicly pledged to launch regular weekend charter
flights, open Taiwan to Chinese tourists, relax restrictions  on investment  in
China,  and  negotiate  direct transportation links.</P>
      <P>But majority support for this more open approach does not equate to wanting
unification, Lee said, citing a recent survey in which 84 percent of the people
said they did not concur that Ma's victory meant a majority of Taiwan's people
agree the island country should unify with China.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that nearly 80 percent of KMT supporters said they voted for
Ma to be president for reasons other than his support for "eventual
unification."</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's status, Lee contended that Taiwan is a "de facto state" because
it has its own territory, inhabitants, government and courts  and  also
exercises  sovereign  rights  and  fulfills responsibilities in the
international community.</P>
      <P>He said it was not imperative for Taiwan to seek international recognition
because it is already a sovereign country based on the 1933 Montevideo
Convention on Rights and Duties of States.</P>
      <P>The convention defines a sovereign state as having a permanent population, a
defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with
other states.</P>
      <P>Lee added that Taiwanese people have no intention of unifying with China and
insisted that the future of a country has to be determined by its people.</P>
      <P>The two-day conference, which opened on Friday, was organized by the nonprofit
Taiwan Thinktank, an independence-leaning public policy research organization.</P>
      <P>Among the scholars attending are Nisuke Ando, former chairperson of the United
NationsHuman Rights Committee, Thomas Grant, senior research fellow of Wolfson
College under the University of Cambridge, and Stephen Yates, former deputy
assistant for national security affairs to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and
now president of DC Asia Advisory.</P>
      <P>The conference featured keynote speeches and four discussion sessions on topics
such as "Taiwans Sovereign Status from the Perspective of International Law, "
"Historical Perspectives of Taiwan's Sovereign Status, " "International
Political Perspective on Taiwan's Sovereign Status, " and "The Prospect and
Future of Taiwan's Sovereign Status.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung municipal government launched a new 24-hour telephone line Friday
to provide comprehensive services and information on its various departments and
agencies.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony marking the launch of the "1999" hotline, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen
Chu, accompanied by Chunghwa Telecom Chairman Tan Ho Chen, received the first
call to the new service line.</P>
      <P>The hot line will be manned by 18 operators working in three shifts to provide
24-hour service.</P>
      <P>Ten physically challenged individuals will serve as operators on the day shift.</P>
      <P>Chen said the move is in line with her policy of taking care of disadvantaged
groups in the city, as well as an extension of a similar policy during her term
as head of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) between 2000-2005.</P>
      <P>The mayor  said  that physically  and mentally  challenged individuals were
employed as operators to man the CLA's customer service lines when she served as
head of the council.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the ceremony, Ho Chen said that a survey of the telephone
company's 3,000-plus operators conducted last year revealed that disabled
operators displayed several characteristics, including patience, consideration
and attentiveness, that made them better suited than others for this line of
work.</P>
      <P>Noting that the telephone company's disabled operators showed "a high EQ and
level of tolerance in dealing with customer complaints, " Ho Chen said he
believes the decision to select such individuals to man the Kaohsiung municipal
government's hot line will increase the quality of service.</P>
      <P>The new "1999" hot line, linking customer service for all of the city
government's units, will operate around the clock 365 days a year, without
interruption.</P>
      <P>The city government's Research,  Development and Evaluation Commission will keep
a record of complaints and requests made via the hot line as well as the various
government ministries' and agencies' responses as a reference in evaluating
their level of service to citizens.</P>

      <P>Chang Yung-fa, founder and chairman of the Evergreen Group, told President-elect
Ma Ying-jeou Friday that he hoped Ma's new government could make regularly
scheduled cross-Taiwan Strait passenger and cargo flights a reality as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>In a half-hour meeting between the two at Evergreen headquarters -- one of Ma's
many encounters with business leaders as he prepares to take office May 20 --
Chang hoped for direct cross-strait charters in July as scheduled and regular
service to follow at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>At a news conference after the meeting, Ma reiterated his plan to open flight
service between Taiwan and China with charters on weekends by July and then on
weekdays by the end of the year before launching regular flight service.</P>
      <P>He said he told Chang that the schedule could be moved up if negotiations went
smoothly and travelers responded favorably to the services.</P>
      <P>"Eventually, there have to be regular flights between the two sides and also
rights allowing  connecting  flights  to other countries, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>Under the president-elect's plan, both Taiwanese and Chinese carriers would
enjoy connecting flight rights, which would create additional opportunities for
them to expand their businesses, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Chang, whose EVA Airways is Taiwan's second largest carrier, also suggested
opening cross-strait charter flights to cargo at the same time that passenger
charters begin, Ma told reporters.</P>
      <P>During their meeting,  the two individuals  also discussed education issues,
with Chang suggesting that the education reform program that has been in place
for the last decade be reviewed and made more inclusive, with a greater emphasis
on moral education.</P>
      <P>"People's hearts have changed in recent years, " Chang said, attributing
deteriorating social order to problems in education.</P>
      <P>The businessman is the founder of the nonprofit Chang Yung-fa Foundation,  which
is devoted  to charity  and public welfare activities.</P>

      <P>Restoring the semi-official negotiation mechanism between Taiwan and China
remains one of the government's long-standing goals, a Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>However, the government insists that such negotiations must be conducted on
principles of equality and dignity, and with no preconditions, said MAC Vice
Chairman Liu Te-hsun.</P>
      <P>Liu was referring to the talks that ground to a halt in 1999 between the Taipei-
based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), the two semi-official intermediary
bodies set up by each side to handle cross-strait affairs in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>Liu made the comment in response to recent remarks by SEF Chairman-designate
Chiang Ping-kung that he will work to resume dialogue between SEF and ARATS,
after he assumes his post.</P>
      <P>On Chiang's plan to invite to Taiwan Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs
Office under China's State Council who is likely to be appointed chairman of
ARATS, Liu said the MAC would welcome whoever is appointed ARATS chairman to
visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu said he believes exchange visits between SEF and ARATS will help enhance
mutual trust and understanding.</P>
      <P>A meeting between the late SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and the late ARATS Chairman
Wang Daohan in Singapore in 1993 brought a series of systematic exchanges
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait after nearly five decades without any
official contact.</P>
      <P>But the exchanges  have  been  stalled  since  1999  when then-President Lee
Teng-hui described cross-strait ties as a special state-to-state relationship.</P>

using their limited daily allowance  or hard-earned scholarship funds.</P>
      <P>Zhongshan Girls High Superintendent Huang Yu-yi welcomed the enthusiasm

      <P>Students  from  10th Class  Yi have jointly  sponsored  a seven-year-old boy,

    <HEADLINE>Mutual non-denial the best solution to cross-strait dispute: Ma</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Friday that "mutual non-denial" is the
best approach the dispute with Beijing over Taiwan's sovereignty and said the
two sides should first deal with issues more urgent than their political
differences.</P>
      <P>While China sees Taiwan as a renegade province,  Taiwan's constitution treats
China as part of the Republic of China's territory, Ma said. To solve the
stalemate, the two can either recognize each other or deny each other's
existence, but that would be "either unnecessary or impossible.</P>
      <P>"The best solution is something in between -- mutual non-denial," he said during
a discussion with 2007 Economics Nobel Laureate Eric S. Maskin, who is on a
three-day visit to Taiwan to attend a forum co-organized by the global
investment company Allianz, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research and
a local newspaper, the Economic Daily News.</P>
      <P>Ma added that it was better to shelve issues which could not be solved at the
moment and first deal with other more urgent ones that could generate more good
will and friendship.</P>
      <P>Maskin described such an approach as "clever and constructive."</P>
      <P>The incoming president, who is to take office May 20, also said that he does not
want to continue arguing with China over the legitimacy of Taiwan's status.</P>
      <P>"Our idea is to combine security, prosperity and dignity. In other words, if
they continue to squeeze us, obviously it is not a friendly signal to Taiwan's
people, " Ma said, referring to China's past use of of its political and
economic clout to suppress Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>During his campaign,  Ma set out the "three noes" -- no unification, no
independence and no use of force -- and "three yeses" -- prosperity, security
and dignity -- to be the guiding principles for cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>However, he admitted that it is not known whether Chinese authorities are ready
to think about his proposals and whether they have such perception.</P>
      <P>Asked whether his world-renowned "mechanism design theory" can be applied to
solve the cross-strait dilemma, Maskin said that while he is not an expert on
cross-strait issues, he is confident that the theory is applicable to the still
unresolved dispute between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"I think mechanism design can definitely be used to help us to think about the
relationship between Taiwan and mainland China," the mathematician from
Princeton University said. "But again, that all depends on the particular
circumstances and details."</P>
      <P>The 57-year-old American scholar, who recently attended the Boao Forum for Asia,
arrived in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>Maskin won the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences along with Leonid
Hurwicz and Roger Myerson, for establishing the foundations of "mechanism design
theory, " a study of designing incentives or institutions to achieve specific
outcomes.</P>
      <P>Initiated in the 1960s by Hurwicz, the theory combines the application of game
theories and social choice theory and is considered  the most notable economic
theory on the study of information asymmetry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA to tighten inspection of farm exports to Japan: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will step up its inspection of farm produce to
be exported to Japan to ensure that levels of pesticide residue do not exceed
the limits set by Japan, an agricultural official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-to,  director-general  of the COA's Department of International
Affairs, made the remark after Japan said in a statement Thursday that it was
tightening inspection of carrots from Taiwan to check every shipment since
excessive levels of pesticide residue, for the second time in April, had been
found on these imports.</P>
      <P>According to a statement by the Japan government, carrots from Taiwan were found
April 15 to contain residues of methamidophos -- a highly dangerous pesticide --
of over 0.02 parts per million (ppm), using a level of monitoring that meant
there was a 30-50 percent chance the produce would be inspected.</P>
      <P>The case involved a shipment of 49 tons of carrots from Taiwan, 23 tons of which
was in a warehouse, while 26 tons was already on the market, according to
Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.</P>
      <P>Japan's limit for methamidophos residue is 0.01 ppm, while Taiwan's, as
regulated by the Department of Health, is 0.1 ppm.</P>
      <P>Chen said the COA will find the origin of the contaminated batch of carrots in
order to provide guidelines for future exports.</P>
      <P>In its statement, Japan said that in the future, carrots that fail to pass its
inspections will not be allowed into the country.</P>
      <P>Japan tightened its inspection from random checks to stricter monitoring of
carrots from Taiwan after excessive pesticide residues were found for the first
time on a shipment April 1, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Chen said that after the first report of the problem, the COA had asked members
of the Taiwan Vegetables  and Fruits Exporters Association to step up their own
monitoring of pesticide residues on produce for export.</P>
      <P>The COA's Agriculture and Food Agency provides subsidies to help farmers to
check for pesticide residues in line with the standards set by the destination
countries, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>All Taiwan's carrot exports to Japan will now be subject to tighter inspections,
which is not favorable to either the export or import firms, as the carrots
would lose their freshness if the shipment has to be delayed for two to three
weeks before entering the market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators objected Friday to rushing
passage of a bill that would upgrade Taiwan's main international airport,
arguing that it would create a "state within a state" and undermine national
security.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip William Lai urged the Kuomintang (KMT) , which will take power
when President-elect Ma Ying-jeou assumes the presidency May 20, to work on the
special airport bill after the new government lineup is in place.</P>
      <P>"The KMT must not rashly ram the bill through the Legislative Yuan before the
current caretaker DPP government's departure, " he said at a news conference
after he and his DPP colleagues met with officials from the Transportation and
Communications, Interior, and Finance ministries to discuss the proposal after
it was screened in committee earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-luan called Tuesday for quick passage of the
bill to upgrade the airport, saying that Taiwan would suffer a decline in
competitiveness if the bill failed to pass soon.</P>
      <P>The measure, which would turn the airport into a legally incorporated business,
includes provisions for the county's proposed development of a "Taoyuan Aviation
Park" on a 6,150-hectare lot adjacent to the airport.</P>
      <P>The park, to be positioned as a multinational business hub with a special
airport zone and free trade zone, could attract over NT$1.2 trillion (US$37
billion) worth of investment,  creating annual business revenue of at least
NT$600 billion and more than 80,000 jobs, Chu contended.</P>
      <P>Lai said he agreed with the idea of turning airports into incorporated
businesses but insisted that the bill be professionally assessed by relevant
agencies after the new government takes power May 20.</P>
      <P>"Various proposals contained in the bill are unworkable because they would
create irreversible and serious consequences if they pass through the
legislature without detailed screening," he said.</P>
      <P>Should the bill submitted by Taoyuan County clear the legislature in its present
form, the Taoyuan Aviation Park would become a "state within a state, " Lai
said, that would involve the authority of 16 government agencies and be exempt
from 33 laws.</P>
      <P>It would also give corporate groups special privileges, such as allowing them to
import Chinese and foreign workers or allowing Chinese nationals to enter Taiwan
without a visa.</P>
      <P>"An influx of Chinese workers would put Taiwan's national security at risk, " he
warned.</P>
      <P>Lai said he is particularly  concerned  that other  local governments might
follow suit if the legislature rashly approves the Taoyuan County bill.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Kuan Pi-ling said that out of Taiwan's 18 airports, the Taoyuan
airport is the only profitable one and is required by law to turn over its
annual NT$6 billion (US$198.7 million) in earnings to a national aviation fund.</P>
      <P>Kuan asked what would happen if it only had to give back NT$1.8 billion per year
as would be the case after becoming an incorporated entity.</P>
      <P>Chu told a news conference at the Legislative Yuan in October last year that the
30-year-old airport, formerly known as the Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport, needs to sharpen its competitiveness, as its ranking has dropped to
85th place among the world's 136 major airports.</P>
      <P>He argued at the time that the airport needed to be turned into a legally and
professionally  incorporated  compound comprising a multinational business
operations hub, a free trade zone, warehousing and distribution facilities,
exhibition centers, tourism hotels, shopping malls and a high-tech science park.</P>
      <P>Without such a project, Chu said, the airport would no longer be globally
competitive and end up being shunted aside.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan County magistrate said Tuesday that the bill would allow Taiwan  to
catch up with Japan and experience  booming growth, and would benefit not only
Taoyuan County but the whole country.</P>
      <P>It would pave the way for development in other special zones such as Taichung
Port and Chingchuankang Airport in central Taiwan's Taichung City, Chu said.</P>

      <P>Illegal petrol traders are rampant on the streets of Taipei City as domestic
gasoline prices are at the highest in history due to skyrocketing international
crude oil prices, a Taipei City councilor claimed Friday.</P>
      <P>"Bootleggers are selling 98 unleaded gasoline at NT$25 (US$0.8) per liter, while
at the gas stations NT$32.2 of the state-run petroleum company CPC. Corp.,
Taiwan (CPC) the price is NT$32.2 per liter, " said Chuang Ruei-hsiung of the
Democratic Progressive Party at a press conference held at the city council.</P>
      <P>With the petrol coming from unknown sources, Chuang warned that the bootlegged
product could cause air pollution which is a health threat. He added that the
low cost of the bootlegged fuel, which is being sold with a free add-on car-wash
service, is drawing taxi drivers, despite the risk of damage to their vehicle
engines.</P>
      <P>Chuang urged the Taipei City authorities to take steps to stop the illegal
trade.</P>
      <P>In response, city officials said a special team has been organized to crack down
on illegal petrol sales, and that offenders may be subject to a fine of NT$1
million under the law governing petroleum management.</P>
      <P>However, to date, the city's law-enforcement officers have not caught any
underground petrol vendors, who are said to operate mostly at night and drive
pickup trucks to evade police checks.</P>

      <P>Former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen registered with the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Friday to compete for the job of reviving a struggling
party badly bruised by two election setbacks this year.</P>
      <P>Tsai was the last of three members to register for the party chairman  race.
The other two aspirants  are pro-independence diehards -- DPP Legislator Trong
Chai and Koo Kuan-min, a former adviser to President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The DPP will try and pick a leader through a coordination process that would
eliminate the rancor of a competitive election. Asked whether she is willing to
coordinate with the other two aspirants, Tsai said that she "has no answer" to
the question</P>
      <P>"Both are revered predecessors, and it is difficult and also an honor for me to
compete with them," she said.</P>
      <P>If coordination among the trio fails, the 52-year-old Tsai is expected to face
73-year-old Chai and 82-year-old Koo in the May 18 party chairman election.</P>
      <P>Tsai, a usually low-profile academic and technocrat, said she "only made the
decision this morning," adding that she "couldn't stop herself" and that an
impossible thing has taken place.</P>
      <P>She noted that a lot of friends urged her to run but many also tried to persuade
her against the idea.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who had said that she probably would never become involved in politics
again after stepping down as vice premier on May 20, 2007,  is currently  the
chairwoman  of TaiMed  Biologics,  a biotechnology company based in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She said that after eight years in power, the party's operations have become
"bureaucratic, " and she hopes to bring the party back to its "simple" nature,
and make it a party of "tolerance."</P>
      <P>The DPP will "transform into an opposition party with ruling experience," she
added.</P>
      <P>Asked if she will resign from her role with TaiMed, she said that she will
"handle the issue properly" in due time.</P>
      <P>She also expressed her views on how to deal with the party's divisive factions
and nominal members -- members who are controlled by party leaders to create
internal personal power bases -- two of the DPP's more intractable problems.</P>
      <P>Tsai said factions were simply groups of people, and she hoped they could be
oriented toward political views or different ways of thinking rather than
traditional mutually dependent blocks.</P>
      <P>On nominal members, Tsai said she would invite scholars to recommend a new set
of rules that would help eradicate the practice.</P>
      <P>She stressed, however, that first determining how to define nominal members and
what they represented, and understanding how they hold back party development
were the questions that really needed to be answered.</P>
      <P>Tsai also acknowledged the party's indebtedness, but she said that if the DPP
could convince the public to support the party, the problem would be more easily
solved.</P>
      <P>She stressed that the DPP, founded in 1987, is still a fledgling party and has
many possibilities in the future. Although it fared dismally in two major
elections this year, she said they should be considered part of a process rather
than the final gauge of the party's success or failure.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that with the DPP facing its biggest challenge after its
defeats in the Jan. 12 legislative elections and the March 22 presidential
election, many DPP members are pinning their hopes on a leader with a fresh
image to help the floundering party back to its feet.</P>
      <P>A DPP young turk likened the situation to the opposition Kuomintang, arguing
that the KMT has changed little from what it was eight years ago but was
transformed by presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou, whose image of integrity was
entrenched in the mind of the public.</P>
      <P>DPP heavyweights, including DPP Central Standing Committee member Ker Chien-
ming, Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang
Chiu-hsing and even former Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh have recently
urged Tsai to join the race.</P>
      <P>Former Council for Hakka Affairs Chairman Luo Wen-jia reportedly said that a
party chairman should be the brand of the party.</P>
      <P>"Even if the party head can't fully help the party regain its image, it should
at least be a major start, " Luo was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Tsai graduated from the department of law at National Taiwan University in 1978,
and then obtained a Master's degree in Legal Science from Cornell University Law
School in 1980 and then a Ph.D. from the London School of Economics (1984).</P>
      <P>Upon her return to Taiwan, she held professorial positions at several
universities until 1993 before being appointed to a succession of bodies,
including chief legal adviser on International Economic Organizations for the
Ministry of Economic Affairs as well as head of the Mainland Affairs Council.</P>

      <P>Chen said before inspecting the production line at the factory in Jiji Township
that the Cloud Leopard armored vehicle was the result of a collaborative project
between the Ministry of National Defense (MND) and local industries.</P>
      <P>Chen added that such a collaboration was conducive to both the ministry and the
private sector because it has created business opportunities and helped upgrade
local industries' capabilities.</P>
      <P>Describing the eight-wheeled vehicle that can reach speeds of 100 kilometers

it was specifically designed to be adaptable to Taiwan's diverse terrain.</P>
      <P>He encouraged the ministry to continue to develop various armored vehicles to

      <P>It took the ministry three years from 2002 to 2005 to develop the vehicle and
small-scale production began last year.</P>
      <P>The armored personnel carrier was named after the Formosan clouded leopard, a

other marine disasters in the country's coastal regions since 2001, spotted the
oil spills floating off Jinshan, Taipei County for the first time Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Multiple ENVISAT satellite radar images show that the oil slick spans 30
kilometers in length and some 500 meters to 1,000 meters in width," said Liu
Shou-an, director of the space research center.</P>
      <P>The oil slick, located some 20 kilometers off Jinshan, have been traced to a
point 25 degrees 39 minutes north latitude and 121 degrees 28 minutes east
longitude, Liu said, almost directly north of Taiwan's northernmost point.</P>
      <P>The spill is suspected of having leaked from a merchant ship sailing in a north-
northwest direction.</P>
      <P>Liu said the center has alerted the EPA and the National Space Center for
continued monitoring in order to determine the source of pollution.</P>
      <P>"We'll also inform neighboring countries of the discovery and ask them to assist
in tracking the movement of the vessel," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-fan, a professor and senior researcher at the center, said major cases
of oceanic pollution are often reported in Taiwan's coastal regions because
Taiwan is a marine transport center in East Asia with a thriving shipping
industry.</P>
      <P>Vessels sailing in waters off Taiwan's coast are also vulnerable to volatile
weather and undersea reefs and atolls have.</P>
      <P>Worse still, he said, human sabotage, such as the release of waste oil and waste
water from merchant vessels that navigate through Taiwan's waters have
aggravated marine pollution and affected the ecological situation in the region.</P>

      <P>Former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen said Friday that if elected  as the chairwoman
of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) she will seek to redefine "Taiwan
identity."</P>
      <P>Tsai said she will also help the party expand its international profile,
including cooperation with nongovernmental organizations, and help solicit
international support, so as to gain a niche for the party and make up for the
deficiency of the Kuomintang (KMT) in the international community.</P>
      <P>The 52-year-old former chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) gave her
views after registering for the party chairman race by Friday's deadline.</P>
      <P>Tsai, echoing a belief held by many in the party that the DPP no longer has a
monopoly on "Taiwan identity, " said that she will seek to redefine  the concept
and incorporate  a wide  array  of interpretations of what it means to be
"Taiwanese."</P>
      <P>Tsai, who was the main architect of the "special state-to-state" cross-strait
relation theory espoused by former President Lee Teng-hui in 1999, also said
that she will seek to build the party's new theoretical framework on China.</P>
      <P>Under the premise of not interfering with cross-strait trade and business
exchanges, Tsai said that she "will seek to strike a balance between
safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty and the development of a new theoretical
framework on China."</P>
      <P>The former vice premier said that for the past two decades, Taiwan and China and
the whole of Asia have undergone many changes, and the situation the Kuomintang
faced in its over five decades of rule until 2000 was quite different than that
faced by the DPP in its eight years in power.</P>
      <P>A lot of people may think that the DPP's China policy is different from that of
the KMT, but they fail to see the different contexts in which the two parties
formulated their policies, she said.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that in the next 10 to 20 years, the situation in Asia will be
completely different, and "how we view Asia and the world outside Asia will
affect the orientation of ourselves and our relations with China."</P>
      <P>Many DPP supporters have expressed concern about the party chairman election,
believing it will be crucial to bring the floundering party back to its feet
after its two major election setbacks this year -- the Jan. 12 legislative
elections and March 22 presidential election, party sources said.</P>
      <P>A lot of DPP heavyweights have been tapped as suitable to head the party,
including Council of Agriculture Chairman Su Jia-chyuan; Chen Shih-meng, former
secretary-general to President Chen Shui-bian; and former Legislator Luo Wen-
jia.</P>
      <P>You Ying-lung, MAC vice chairman and Straits Exchange Foundation secretary-
general, even picked up a registration form Thursday, but all of the above
contenders decided not to register for the race.</P>
      <P>Tsai's competition will be two pro-independence diehards -- DPP Legislator Trong
Chai and Koo Kuan-min, a former adviser to President Chen.</P>
      <P>The election is scheduled to take place May 18 if coordination among the trio
fails to produce a consensus candidate.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government should impose a quota on the total number of taxis
operating in the northern city to resolve the problem of low occupancy rates, a
Taipei city councilor said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Councilor Chen Yung-te said during a question-and- answer session at
the council that seven in 10 cabs in the city are often unoccupied.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics for the period 2004 to 2006, Chen said that local taxi drivers
picked up passengers 14.53 times a day on average, and that the drivers worked
about 24 days per month.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that 1,984 cases involving unregistered taxi drivers were
reported last year and that many of the traffic violations by taxi drivers were
speeding, illegal parking and drunk driving.</P>
      <P>Many cab drivers enter the business after losing their jobs or if they are
between jobs and they often rush around dangerously competing for customers,
Chen said, stressing that it was necessary to introduce a quota for the number
of cabs in the city.</P>
      <P>In response, Luo Shiaw-shyan, head of the city's Department of Transportation,
attributed the city's oversupply of cabs to an inflow of taxis from the
neighboring Taipei County, Keelung City and Yilan County.</P>
      <P>There are more than 60,000 taxis in the four cities and counties, according to
Luo.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government  has suspended issuing business licenses to cab
drivers because the number of registered taxi drivers grew by 20 percent to more
than 30,000 over the last decade, Luo said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Luo urged the central government to enact a law or provide other
support to help impose a taxi quota system that would resolve the oversupply
problem.</P>
      <P>Many of the city's approximately 2.63 million residents, the second largest
metropolitan population in Taiwan, rely on scooters and a convenient public
transportation network, comprised of a mass rapid transit system and buses, to
get around.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will closely monitor developments when China President Hu Jintao visits
Japan next month, Taiwan's representative to Japan Ko Se-kai said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ko said that his office will carefully follow Hu's visit May 6 during which he
is expected to meet with Japanese Emperor Akihito and Prime Minister Yasuo
Fukuda and sign a "fourth political document" that will complement the three --
a 1972 Sino- Japanese Joint Statement, the 1978 Peace and Friendship Treaty, and
the 1998 Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration -- that form the foundation for Sino-
Japanese ties.</P>
      <P>Ko said that if the document mentions Taiwan, he hopes Japan will not deviate
from its previous  stance,  which is that Japan acknowledges but does not
recognize China's claim that Taiwan is a part of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The envoy made the remarks when he reported on bilateral relations between
Taiwan and Japan at a legislative committee hearing.</P>
      <P>He would not comment when asked about the possibility of President-elect Ma
Ying-jeou visiting Japan prior to his inauguration May 20.</P>
      <P>Ko noted that Japan was concerned about whether the incoming Kuomintang
administration, which is considered to be more pro-China than the DPP
administration, will change its policy toward Japan.</P>
      <P>"Both Taiwan and Japan should brief the other side on its exchanges with China
to avoid misunderstandings," he continued.</P>
      <P>Ko also said that Taiwan and Japan have seen some breakthroughs in their
relations in recent years mainly because of the ascension of several prime
ministers and cabinet members who are friendly to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future of bilateral relations, Ko said that his office will
dedicate itself to promoting the opening of new air routes between Japan's
Haneda Airport and Taiwan's airports.</P>
      <P>Haneda Airport, which handles both domestic and international traffic,  is only
10 kilometers from central Tokyo, far more conveniently located than Narita
International Airport.</P>
      <P>The signing of a free trade agreement between the two countries will be still
difficult, Ko said, adding that his office will focus instead on talks on
specific issues such as intellectual property rights, trade facilitation and the
signing of a bilateral investment agreements.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu may lead a delegation to attend an international travel
expo in Beijing in June to promote the southern port city as a tourist
destination, a city official said Friday.</P>
      <P>However, Chen will only make the visit under the principles of equal treatment
and mutual respect, said Liu Hsin-cheng, head of the city's Economic Affairs
Bureau.</P>
      <P>Liu's remarks came one day after Chen expressed willingness to visit Beijing as
long as China will not downgrade her position to a local head of the Chinese
government.</P>
      <P>China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, although they split after a civil war in
1949.</P>
      <P>Chen said that since she was elected as Kaohsiung mayor in 2006, China has twice
denied her a visa, once to visit Beijing last May, and again to visit Hong Kong
earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed doubts about the sincerity of a statement made by Li Weiyi,
spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, April 16 that he would welcome
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) heads of local governments on visits
to China in their "proper capacities."</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated that her current unalterable position is mayor of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The DPP is generally considered as favoring formal independence for Taiwan, a
stance that China says is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Liu also met with representatives from the city's hotels, travel
agencies and associations to discuss how to attract Chinese tourists to
Kaohsiung once they are allowed to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The representatives suggested that city officials should lead delegations on
visits to China to raise Kaohsiung's profile, and should print brochures in
simplified Chinese for potential tourists from China.</P>
      <P>In addition, they also asked the city government to open Kaohsiung Harbor to
Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu said that the city government will set up a pavilion of 12
booths -- which he said will outnumber those planned by Taipei County, Yilan
County, Hualien County and Yunlin County -- at Beijing's travel expo June 19-21
to feature the city's tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Liu added that Chen will also lead a delegation to visit Japan in May and others
to South Korea and Singapore in September to try to lure more visitors to
Kaohsiung.</P>

      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) vice chairman will serve as the incoming
president's chief of staff, President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's office announced late
Friday in a statement.</P>
      <P>Chan Chuen-po, who has been a KMT vice chairman since 2007, will serve as
secretary-general of the Presidential Office after Ma is sworn in on May 20, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Former Taipei Deputy Mayor Yeh Chin-chuan will serve as Chan's deputy, the
statement added.</P>
      <P>Chan, 67, is a veteran KMT official who has held many important party posts,
including secretary-general.  He was the party's secretary-general during Ma's
tenure as KMT chairman from August 2005 to early 2007. Chan also played a
leading role in Ma's presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>Yeh, 58, a high school classmate of Ma, served as health chief of Taipei for two
years after Ma became mayor of the city in 1998. He then left that post and
became a public health professor at Tzu Chi University. He returned to the front
line during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the
country in 2003. His role was important in boosting the morale of the staff at
Taipei's Hoping Hospital during the SARS crisis.</P>
      <P>Yeh became Taipei's deputy mayor in August 2004, but quit the post in April 2006
to seek KMT nomination to run for Taipei mayor, a bid he lost.</P>
      <P>The new appointments came a day after Chan Chi-shean, one of Ma's key campaign
strategists, issued a public statement said he had decided not to be part of the
new government or the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chan Chi-shean, a noted surgeon who once served as Department of Health minister
in the previous KMT administration, had been widely tipped to be the new
president's deputy chief of staff or vice premier.</P>
      <P>In a statement that caught many by surprise, Chan Chi-shean said he will join
Taiwan's largest charity group -- Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation
-- after Ma takes office May 20.</P>
      <P>Chan Chi-shean was the superintendent of Chi Mei Medical Center in Tainan City,
one of the most prestigious medical institutions in southern Taiwan, before he
joined Ma's campaign team last July.</P>

Chen said, stressing that it was necessary to introduce a quota for the number
of cabs in the city.</P>
      <P>In response, Luo Shiaw-shyan, head of the city's Department of Transportation,
attributed the city's oversupply of cabs to an inflow of taxis from the
neighboring Taipei County, Keelung City and Yilan County.</P>
      <P>There are more than 60,000 taxis in the four cities and counties, according to
Luo.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government  has suspended issuing business licenses to cab
drivers because the number of registered taxi drivers grew by 20 percent to more
than 30,000 over the last decade, Luo said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Luo urged the central government to enact a law or provide other
support to help impose a taxi quota system that would resolve the oversupply
problem.</P>
      <P>Many of the city's approximately 2.63 million residents, the second largest
metropolitan population in Taiwan, rely on scooters and a convenient public
transportation network, comprised of a mass rapid transit system and buses, to
get around.</P>

      <P>The number of mobile phone subscriptions registered  for mobile  Internet
services  soared  30 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 11.86
million, but actual usage of the function lagged behind, an industry report has
revealed.</P>
      <P>The increase of 2.71 million mobile Internet subscriptions in Taiwan meant that
48.8 percent of all cell phone subscriptions had access to Internet service
functions, according to a report released recently by the Foreseeing Innovative
New Digiservices (FIND), a Web site run by the Institute for Information
Industry to provide professional information on Internet demographics and
trends.</P>
      <P>It said the growth was mainly attributable to a sharp rise in 3G data service
subscriptions, which nearly doubled from 3.29 million in the fourth quarter of
2006 to 6.53 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and accounted  for 51.1
percent  of all mobile Internet subscriptions.</P>
      <P>That share outpaced the 32 percent subscribed for the Internet through general
packet radio services (GPRS), a clear indication that 3G is replacing GPRS as
the mainstream technology for mobile Internet access.</P>
      <P>The rise in mobile Internet subscriptions, however, has not necessarily led to
an increase in mobile Internet users.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by FIND in August 2007 and released in January
2008, only 9.7 percent of Taiwan's population, or 2.22 million people, had gone
online using mobile devices, only 1.6 percentage points higher than in 2006.</P>
      <P>The results indicate that mobile Internet use may not be as popular as it
appears to be, FIND analysts said, adding that promoting its use reamins a major
issue to be addressed by mobile network operators.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Friday condemned China's military crackdown on Tibet
and said he supports the pope's message of encouraging "dialogue and tolerance"
in solving the problem.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony celebrating the third anniversary of Pope Benedict XVI's ascension
to the papacy at the Holy See's embassy in Taipei, Chen called on the Beijing
government  to solve the problem peacefully,  improve its human rights
practices, and guarantee religious freedom to China's people.</P>
      <P>During a weekly audience in late March after the suppression occurred, the
pontiff appealed for an end to the violence in Tibet and neighboring areas in
China, and urged Beijing and Lhasa to find "solutions that will safeguard peace

      <P>Protests in the Tibetan capital by Buddhist monks demanding greater cultural
freedom and automony turned violent on March 14 and were suppressed militarily

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Chinese International Economic Cooperation Association and the U.S.
Department of Commerce jointly held symposiums in two major U.S. East Coast
cities in recent days to introduce Taiwan's advantages as a springboard for U.S.
businesses wanting to make inroads into China.</P>
      <P>The first symposium on "Taiwan and Hong Kong as Gateways to Asia" was held in
Philadelphia on Thursday, with more than 100 business management academics from
around Pennsylvania attending.</P>
      <P>The second gathering  took place Friday  at the Manhattan headquarters of the
international package delivery company UPS, with 100-plus U.S. businesspeople
based in the New York area taking part.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Commerce invited Gregory M. Wong, head of the American
Institute in Taiwan's Commecial Section, to deliver a speech on "Taiwan: Asia's
Strategic Market" at the two seminars.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Wong said that Taiwan is a society of friendly and hospitable
people where English is one of the languages of business. He further said
Taiwan's people are very familiar with "the American lifestyle" and have
incorporated many elements of it into their own lives, adding that U.S. products
have enjoyed strong popularity in the country.</P>
      <P>Wong also said that with the recent election of Ma Ying-jeou and Vincent Siew as
the new president and vice president, respectively, Taiwan's new administration
is expected to follow a more open policy on links with China, including allowing
convertibility of the Chinese yuan and Taiwan dollar in Taiwan and launching
regular direct cross-strait flight services.</P>
      <P>He noted that this more liberalized approach will make Taiwan even more
attractive in terms of serving as a platform for U.S. businesses looking to make
inroads into the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Wang cited several sets of statistics to stress the importance of business ties
between Taiwan and the U.S., noting that Taiwan is the United States' ninth
largest trading partner and the 10th largest market for U.S. exports.</P>
      <P>He also said that the United States is the second largest destination for
overseas investment by Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>Noting that the U.S. Department of Commerce places importance on Taiwan's trade
and economic position in the world, Wong said that of the department's 20-plus
overseas units, its presence in Taiwan ranks ninth in the world in terms of
staff numbers.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan ranks third in terms of the amount of information and
statistics provided to U.S. businesses on export opportunities.</P>
      <P>Participants in the symposiums raised many questions following Wong's speech,
including queries related to the future direction of Taiwan's industrial
development policies as well as the climate for foreigners doing business in the
country.</P>
      <P>Wong invited Mr. V.C. Chu, director of the Investment and Trade Office of the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO)
, to assist in answering the participants' questions.</P>
      <P>Chu said that Mandarin is the main language used in business and daily life in
Taiwan but that the use of English is also quite prevalent in doing business.</P>
      <P>Chu also introduced various aspects of the Taiwan government's industrial
development  policies,  including  the elements and achievements of its "Two
Trillion Twin Stars" policy, as well as the next administration's planned
projects on infrastructure development and boosting trade and investment.</P>
      <P>After Friday's symposium in New York City, the participants paid a visit to
TECRO's Investment and Trade Office to discuss cooperation on boosting
Taiwan-U.S. economic and trade ties in the future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A convenience chain operator has recently succeeded in boosting revenues of its
outlet in Taipei 101 by abandoning the standard convenience store look and
creating a deluxe ambiance catering to the building's higher-end customers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan FamilyMart Co.'s renovation of its store on the 35th floor of the
skyscraper has boosted spending per customer by 30 percent and sales revenues by
35 percent since the outlet was reopened on April 7, according to FamilyMart
manager Lin Tsuei-chuan.</P>
      <P>The renovation is part of the chain's plan to customize its stores to the
communities or neighborhoods in which they are located to reflect the changing
tastes of consumers.</P>
      <P>FamilyMart President Chang Ren-dun said his company believes that today's
consumers want the convenience store to deliver "lifestyle satisfaction" rather
than simply time savings as has been the case in the past, leading to the
concept of a "new-style" outlet found in Taipei 101.</P>
      <P>Lin, who said a number of the chain's 2,259 stores are undergoing similar
renovations, indicated that these new outlets will vary the products they sell
based on location.</P>
      <P>She pointed out, for example, that the company's first new-style chain store in
a hospital district, inaugurated last year, offers more products related to
medical care and fruits and gift baskets people can offer as gifts when visiting
patients than one would find at a typical FamilyMart shop.</P>
      <P>Lin said the product mix in the chain's Taipei 101 store, which is only
accessible by workers and tenants in the building, is 30 percent different from
regular outlets, with fresh fruit, low-fat, low-sugar snacks, 300 imported
items, and cosmetic products that are popular among young female consumers on
offer.</P>
      <P>A large portion of people working in the building are foreign businessmen and
female employees.</P>

      <P>A government-run laboratory is close to developing an imagery database of guinea
pigs that will allow "virtual animal testing, " reducing the cost of drug
development and the demand for live laboratory animals, sources at the National
Applied Research Laboratories (NARL) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The 3D-virtual guinea pig system was developed by NARL's National Laboratory
Animal Center (NLAC) ,  which used true-color image algorithms to reconstruct
guinea pigs in a digitized environment.</P>
      <P>NLAR researchers said they have finished establishing the imagery data and will
have the system ready for practical applications after some final adjustments
are made.</P>
      <P>Explaining how the system functions, NLAR researchers said that after parameters
have been entered,  the system projects the interaction between a drug and the
animal based on given settings and the guinea pigs' sectional images,  physical
information,  and biological characteristics entered in the database.</P>
      <P>Researchers said such a process would be able to replace some live animal
experiments, saving the lives of laboratory animals and the cost of acquiring
guinea pigs.</P>
      <P>Taking drug experiments as an example, researchers noted that a series of
experiments require hundreds to thousands of rodents, and that a "specific
pathogen free" (SPF) mouse can cost up to several thousand Taiwan dollars.</P>

      <P>A special exhibition aiming at raising the public's awareness of global warming
and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions opened Saturday, with some 100
activists pledging to save energy resources on a daily basis to save the earth.</P>
      <P>Visitors of the exhibition can calculate how many tons of carbon dioxide they
produce per day by answering a quiz, and they will also become acquainted with
the impact of global warming and the ways people can conserve energy to make the
earth healthier.</P>
      <P>"I hope people can really understand that our earth is sick, " said Josephine
Lee, a spokeswoman of the event organizer - - the Da-an Branch of the Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation (TCF).</P>
      <P>Saying that knowing about global warming is not enough, Lee emphasized that "we
must learn what to do and how to do it to save energy on a daily basis, thus
helping save our environment."</P>
      <P>One fifth grader who visited the exhibition with her mother, vowed to invite her
friends to save energy after attending the show.</P>
      <P>"Through the exhibition, I now understand the importance of environmental
protection," said Wu Chi-ning.</P>
      <P>Seven-year-old boy Chang Ching-hsiang said he learned that "the reduction of
carbon dioxide emissions will also reduce flooding " and encouraged people to
get into the habit of garbage sorting and recycling.</P>
      <P>Kim Cassidy, the only foreign Tzu Chi commissioner in Taiwan, suggested at the
opening ceremony that everyone should use public transportation more often and
switch off lights when they aren't needed.</P>
      <P>"It saves not only the earth but also our money, Cassidy said, who was born in
New York and learned about the foundation when it solicited help for victims of
a major earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999 that battered central Taiwan and left 2,145
dead.</P>
      <P>Based on the teachings of Master Cheng Yen, who founded the foundation in 1996
and has been devoted to environmental protection for more than 20 years, the
foundation's Da-an Branch will also launch a campaign to show its determination
to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, Lee said.</P>
      <P>More than 300 shops on Zhongxiao East Road, one of Taipei's most popular
shopping areas, will switch off their store signboards simultaneously for 10
minutes Sunday evening, Lee said.</P>
      <P>"It wont affect the businesses at all, " she said. "On the contrary, it not only
serves the shops but also shoppers as a reminder to conserve energy."</P>

      <P>The Chou Ta-kuan Cultural and Educational Foundation (CTKF) , a local charity
dedicated to caring for children with cancer and other serious diseases, said
Saturday it will donate the proceeds from sales of a book of poems in the United
States to an American cancer society to benefit poor child cancer patients.</P>
      <P>Titled "I Still Have a Leg", the selection of the poems to be sold in the U.S.
was created by Chou Ta-kuan, a 10-year old boy who died in 1997 of cancer but
retained a passion for life until his final days.</P>
      <P>After Chou's death, his parents founded the foundation in 1997 to provide
medical services and financial aid to children afflicted with serious diseases.</P>
      <P>In the foundation's "Send Love to America" activity, "I Still Have a Leg" will
be released in the United States in early May, the 12th country where the book
has been published.</P>
      <P>To date, 4 million copies have been sold in different languages around the
world, with the more than NT$16 million in royalties earned used to help the
poorest among ailing children in 11 countries.</P>
      <P>Besides making a donation to the cancer society, the foundation will also
present "Love for Life Awards" to three lovers of life living in the U.S.</P>
      <P>"This is a most beautiful and touching diplomatic mission, " said Foreign
Minister James Huang, who was invited to the event by the foundation.</P>
      <P>At Saturday's news conference, Huang and Chou Jin-hua, the founder of the
foundation and Chou Ta-kuan's father, awarded two Taiwanese young girls with the
"Love For Life" award, affirming their passion and perseverance in striving for
life.</P>
      <P>One of the recipients, Lin Mu-ching, had her left leg amputated at the age of 16
because of cancer. Encouraged by Chou's poems, she decided later to overcome her

    <HEADLINE>Domestic inflation could top 3% if oil prices keep rising: CIER</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's inflation rate could rise to 3.23 percent if the average price of West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averages US$115.84 per barrel this year, a
local economic think tank has forecast.</P>
      <P>If crude oil prices maintain levels in that range, Taiwan's projected economic
growth would shrink to 4.6 percent, while private consumption growth would fall
slightly from a projected 3.29 percent to 3.23 percent, according to a report
released this week by the Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER).</P>
      <P>With the WTI oil prices projected to average US$100.61 per barrel this year, the
CIER has predicted a 2.64 percent increase in Taiwan's consumer price index
(CPI) for this year, and 4.67 percent growth in the country's gross domestic
product.</P>
      <P>Both numbers exceed estimates by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics, which predicted in February that inflation would rise only
moderately by 1.98 percent this year and economic growth would reach 4.32
percent.</P>
      <P>However, if the average WTI oil price declines to US$93 per barrel, the CIER
predicted that economic growth would expand slightly to 4.71 percent and private
consumption would rise to 3.33 percent. The inflation rate, meanwhile, would
fall to 2.3 percent.</P>
      <P>Oil prices may drop if supply increases or if a worldwide economic slowdown
causes global demand to decrease, the research body said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is the most democratic country among Chinese-speaking nations, which
enables writers or artists to fully unleash their creativity, Taipei Mayor Hau
Lung-bin said Saturday at an event honoring authors of children's picture books.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should be proud of its creativity in cultural activities" spawned by its
democracy, Hau said at an award ceremony organized by the Hsin-Yi Foundation
(HYF) to honor picture books for children aged between 0 and 8.</P>
      <P>The foundation was established in 1971 to promote early childhood education, and
the award was created 20 years ago to introduce good picture books that parents
and their children could share together.</P>
      <P>At Saturday's ceremony, six winning titles chosen from 191 entries were honored,
including one telling a story about a toad and an anole (a small lizard) that
won its two authors the top prize of NT$200,000 (US$6,557).</P>
      <P>Hau said that children's books were rarely published in Taiwan decades ago and
stressed that the foundation's achievements in creating a good reading

    <HEADLINE>Fresh start for DPP after registration: party chairman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The absence of past party heavyweights from this year's Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) chairman election registration marks a fresh start for the party,
DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was referring to himself and the three other contenders for the DPP's
presidential nomination last year -- former premiers Su Tseng-chang and Yu Shyi-
kun and Vice President Annette Lu. None of them came forward to register for the
race by Friday's deadline.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who lost to his rival Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang by 2.21 million
votes in the March 22 presidential election, said that "I have said that I
wouldn't run, but the others could have of course joined the race."</P>
      <P>"This means that the people want a change for the party and that the newcomers
will have a free hand in bringing thorough change, " he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in the last of a series of meetings held to review the
DPP's latest election setback. Nearly 200 party officials, including Su and Lu,
attended the meeting at the Taipei International Convention Center.</P>
      <P>Conspicuously  absent from the meeting was President  Chen Shui-bian, who said
on the sidelines of a fundraiser held Saturday afternoon that he "took leave"
because he himself is the target of review and his absence would allow others to
"speak their minds more freely." The other absentee was Yu.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that "the party's fate lies in its name -- democracy and progress."
The people have high expectations for the party to continue to progress, he
said, and criticism will be heaped on the party if it doesn't pursue the path of
progress.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP suffered major setbacks for a multitude of reasons, and this is
why it held a series of meetings to listen to the views of people from all walks
of life, and not just from party members.</P>
      <P>Three DPP members registered for the chairmanship election -- former Vice
Premier Tsai Ing-wen, DPP Legislator Trong Chai and Koo Kuan-min, a former
adviser to President Chen -- and Hsieh hoped a new party leader could be
produced as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The DPP's party chairman election will be held May 18 and the winner inaugurated
May 21, much earlier than in the past when a new chairman would not have assumed
the post until July, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The schedule has been moved up, he said, to create a "seamless transition"  so
that there will be no vacuum in the party's check-and-balance of the new
president, who will be sworn in on May 20.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who left the meeting after speaking for about 10 minutes, urged all
participants to freely express their views on party reform to help it regain its
feet.</P>
      <P>Chai and Koo attended Saturday's gathering, but Tsai was absent because of a
previously scheduled overseas visit.</P>
      <P>On suggestions by some DPP members, including Su, that it would be better to
come up with a chairman through a consultative process, Chai said an important
trait for a party chairman would be the ability to solve the party's problems.</P>
      <P>"If Tsai has the capacity and the determination, then it will be all right for
her to serve in the post," Chai said.</P>
      <P>But he argued that party and administrative  affairs  are different, which would
make it difficult for Tsai, whose political career has been spent mostly as an
administrator.</P>
      <P>The major function  of a party chairman is to "help win elections, " Chai said,
but his rival, he contended, is "not familiar with party affairs."</P>
      <P>Chai contended he is more capable than Tsai in many key areas, such as election
affairs, party affairs, Taiwan identity and reform of the DPP.</P>
      <P>He stressed the first crucial test for the DPP will be the city and county head
elections in late 2009, saying that if the DPP continued its losing streak, it
will be wiped out.</P>
      <P>Koo, a pro-independence diehard like Chai, was all praise for Tsai but said, "I
wouldn't know how the chair issue can be coordinated."</P>
      <P>On suggestions that coordination was necessary for the sake of party unity, Koo
said, "it's easier said than done."</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung  Mayor Chen Chu gave her blessing to all three contenders, expressing
the hope that the race can end peacefully and that no one gets bruised because
of the heated competition as the party could not afford more infighting.</P>
      <P>Chen also laid out the qualifications that an ideal chairperson would have --
being able to unify the party's factions and live up to the high expectations of
society, and having ideals and regaining the public's trust of the party.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-born Oscar-wining film director Ang Lee disclosed Friday that he is
currently working on a comedy, tentatively named A Little Game.</P>
      <P>He said the film, a Hollywood-style picture on a modest budget, will not have
any Chinese actors or actresses, and he hoped it could be completed and released
next year.</P>
      <P>Lee, whose credits include Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which won the Academy
Award for Best Foreign Picture in 2000, and Brokeback Mountain, which won the
Academy Award for Best Director in 2005, said the purpose of making a movie is
neither to please the audience nor to ask them to completely accept it.</P>
      <P>He said the hope that he can convey ideas and communicate with moviegoers is
what inspires him to produce films.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in a seminar with actress/director Joan Chen at a three-day
annual meeting organized by the Committee of 100 (C100) in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Both Lee and Chen were honored for their achievement in the film industry.</P>
      <P>The C100 is a prominent nonprofit organization based in New York City that was
founded in 1990 by a group of Chinese Americans who are leaders in their
respective fields. Committee members include noted AIDS researcher David Ho and
Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang.</P>
      <P>Lee last came to Taiwan in September 2007 to promote his latest work "Lust,
Caution, " a spy thriller adapted from a short novel by the late Chinese author
Eileen Chang, which was loosely based on an actual event that took place in
1939-1940 in Japanese occupied Shanghai.</P>

      <P>The incoming presidential chief of staff said Saturday he is confident of
fulfilling his duty as the Presidential  Office's  top day-to-day  affairs
manager  after President-elect Ma Ying-jeou is sworn in on May 20.</P>
      <P>Chan  Chuen-po,  a vice chairman  of the soon-to-be-ruling Kuomintang (KMT)  who
concurrently serves as convener of Ma's transition team, was tapped Friday to
serve as secretary-general of the Presidential Office following Ma's
inauguration.</P>
      <P>Chan, 67, is a veteran KMT official who had held many important party posts
before becoming one of the party's six vice chairmen last year. He is known for
his knack for subtle political negotiations.</P>
      <P>He served as the party's secretary-general during Ma's tenure as KMT chairman
from August 2005 to early 2007 and also played a leading role in Ma's
presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has established a good rapport with Ma after more than 10 years
of interaction, Chan said he was fully confident of meeting the requirements of
being the incoming president's chief of staff.</P>
      <P>"At the moment, my most important work is to ensure an orderly transition  from
the  outgoing  Democrtic  Progressive  Party administration to the incoming KMT
administration as well as to help guarantee that the presidential inauguration
proceeds smoothly," Chan said.</P>
      <P>Although Ma named Chan as the convener of the transition team immediately after
his decisive victory in the March 22 presidential poll, Ma didn't formally offer
him the post in the incoming government until late Friday, amid speculation of a
fierce power struggle within KMT ranks.</P>
      <P>According to Chan, Ma twice discussed with him on April 5 and 13 the possibility
of working in the Presidential Office, but didn't mention any specific post for
him in the new government until Friday.</P>
      <P>A short list of candidates for the presidential chief of staff post was widely
circulated in the past few weeks and included incumbent Taichung Mayor Jason Hu
and KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih. Both men were later ruled out for various
reasons.</P>
      <P>Chan Chuen-po's appointment came only a day after Chan Chi-shean, another of
Ma's key campaign strategists, issued a public statement declaring his decision
of not to be part of the new government or the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chan Chi-shean, a noted surgeon who once served as Department of Health (DOH)
chief in the previous KMT administration, had been widely tipped to be the new
president's chief of staff, deputy chief of staff or vice premier.</P>
      <P>In the statement that caught many by surprise, Chan Chi-shean said he will join
Taiwan's largest charity group -- Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation
-- after Ma takes office May 20.</P>
      <P>Chan Chi-shean was the superintendent of Chi Mei Medical Center in Tainan City,
one of the most prestigious medical institutions in southern Taiwan, before he
joined Ma's campaign team last July.</P>
      <P>Also on Friday, Ma named Yeh Ching-chuan, a former deputy mayor of Taipei, as
deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Yeh, 58, a high school classmate of Ma, served as health chief of Taipei for two
years after Ma became mayor of the city in 1998. He then left that post and
became a public health professor at Tzu Chi University. He returned to the front
line during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the
country in 2003. His role was important in boosting the morale of the staff at
Taipei's Hoping Hospital during the SARS crisis.</P>
      <P>Yeh became Taipei's deputy mayor in August 2004, but quit the post in April 2006
to seek KMT nomination to run for Taipei mayor, a bid he lost.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Saturday that Ma originally offered him the post of DOH chief. "I
rejected that offer as I don't like to be in the limelight, " Yeh said, adding
that Ma asked him to serve as Chan Chuen-po's deputy only two days ago.</P>
      <P>"I'll take delight in teaming up with Chan in running the Presidential Office's
day-to-day affairs after the inauguration of the new administration, " Yeh told
reproters after a meeting with Chan at the KMT headquarters Saturday morning.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A type of lizard native to Southeast Asia, South Asia and southern China is
invading Taiwan, threatening the local ecological balance and the survival of
native lizards and its cousin living along Taiwan's coastline, researchers
warned.</P>
      <P>The lined lizards, known simply as skinks or by the species name mabuya
multifasciata, are spreading to the central and eastern parts of the island from
the south where they were first discovered in 1992, according to studies
released recently by the Endemic Species Research Institutes (ESRI)  under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>In 2001, ESRI researchers discovered during field surveys that the intruder had
spread to Pingtung and Tainan counties after being first spotted in Kaohsiung
nine years earlier, ESRI researcher Lin Teh-en said.</P>
      <P>Five years later, the alien skinks were found building their colonies in Tainan,
Chiayi and Yunlin counties, Lin said, warning that the species may soon spread
to other parts of the island and even to Orchid and Green islands off Taiwan's
southeastern coast because of their unique adaptability.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that unlike native lizards, the lined skinks do not need to
hibernate because of their stronger resistance to cold weather.</P>
      <P>That allows the reptile to breed in every season, and once they intrude into
places inhabited by native lizards and skinks, such as the Formosa smooth skink
and Formosa grass lizard, they are able to expel or wipe out the locals, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>The institute recently discovered a possible victim of the alien skinks'
invasion. An ESRI report noted that it is getting difficult to spot the coastal
skink, known as emoia atrocostata, in its normal habitat, the rocky shorelines
of southern and eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Instead, there are many signs of the alien skinks' presence in the coastal
areas, the ESRI said.</P>
      <P>It warned that the local species is facing a threat from the outsiders, but said
it was not clear what could be done to help the coastal skink because not much
is known about its biological characteristics.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Mobile Co., the nation's second largest telecom service carrier, adopted
10,000 trees to help build the forest in central Taiwan as part of its efforts
to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and slow down global warming.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Mobile Vice Chairman Daniel Tsai then donated the adopted 10,000 tree
seedlings to National Taiwan University (NTU) Vice President Chen Tai-jan at the
Sitou Recreational Area in Nantou County's Luku Township.</P>
      <P>The NTU Experimental Forest Administration based in Luku will create 6.5
hectares of forest within 10 years with the donated seedlings.</P>
      <P>Tree planting is the most direct way to slow down global warming as it helps
adjust temperatures, and the adopted 10,000 are expected to absorb 250 tons of
carbon dioxide and generate 190 tons of oxygen every year, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>As part of Saturday's activity, over 1,300 employees of Taiwan Mobile and their
families planted 1,000 tree seedlings in Sitou to show their support for
environmental protection.</P>
      <P>They pledged to develop habits that help reduce carbon dioxide emissions in
daily life, including walking more and driving less, in line with global efforts
for environmental protection as part of World Earth Day which falls on April 22.</P>
      <P>The company also held ecological tours and an outdoor concert along with the
tree planting activity and donation ceremony for participants to appreciate the
beauty of nature.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Mobile President Harvey Chang said the planted saplings, including ring
cupped oak and soapberry trees, are all strains beneficial to a balanced
ecosystem.</P>
      <P>The recreational  area suffered  devastating  mudflows  and landslides during

      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman-designate Chiang Pin-kung
foresees the resumption of stalled cross-strait dialogue in June, soon after the
new administration of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou takes the reins of power May
20, a Japanese paper reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with the Japanese daily, Asahi Shimbun, Chiang said
that once he assumes his post atop the SEF,  a semi-official body that handles
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of diplomatic ties, he will visit China as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Ranking Chinese officials could also visit Taiwan, Chiang said, noting  that
"this  will be the first step toward  improving cross-strait relations, and I'm
sure that China would be favorable to the move."</P>
      <P>Cross-strait dialogue has been suspended since 1999 after then- President Lee
Teng-hui described the cross-strait relationship as a "special state-to-state"
one.</P>
      <P>Chiang also expressed the hope of early consultations with China on such issues
as weekend cross-strait charter flights, opening Taiwan up to Chinese tourists
and allowing the full convertibility of the Taiwan dollar and Chinese yuan on
Taiwan proper, all of which were Ma's campaign promises.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he hoped to deliver Ma's campaign promises, saying that cross-strait
consultations could be handled initially through party-to-party channels.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu called Saturday for continued support for a free
after-school tutoring program for schoolchildren from disadvantaged families
that she launched around the country in March 2007.</P>
      <P>Lu made the appeal at a luncheon aimed at raising funds for the "Little Scholar
School" program that was initiated by her along with a group of like-minded
social activists.</P>
      <P>Addressing the fund raiser at the National Taiwan University Hospital's
International Convention Center, Lu said she looks forward to seeing the program
continue after her imminent retirement.</P>
      <P>"Every child is our baby. Even though the program requires a large sum of money,
I don't want to see it suspended because of my retirement next month, " said Lu
whose second four-year term expires May 20.</P>
      <P>With the "new poor" issue getting ever more serious, the number of young
schoolchildren who need assistance in schooling is also increasing, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Since the inauguration of the "Little Scholar School" program, it has helped
more than 9,000 schoolchildren, including those born to foreign mothers or
aboriginal  parents as well as those from low-income families and single-parent
familes or those who are raised by grandparents.</P>
      <P>"But I believe that the actual number of schoolchildren who need help with their
homework after school is much higher and could be as many as 200,000," Lu said
with tears welling up in her eyes.</P>
      <P>Lu said she hopes local philanthropists will not cut off their contributions to
the program after her retirement but will instead continue financial support to
maintain its continuity.</P>
      <P>"We can fund the program simply by drinking one less bottle of luxury wine and
buying one less brand-name handbag," she added.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and many other
politicians also attended the fund raiser and contributed funds to the program.
Wang donated a wooden sculpture created by a South American artist for charity

      <P>The Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) refrained Saturday
from making any comments on a foreign wire service report that the United States
may post Marine guards at its new office complex in Taipei's Neihu district.</P>
      <P>The Associated Press reported Saturday that the U.S. Department of State has
published an adertisement in the English-language Taipei Times newspaper calling
for contractors to construct quarters for Marine security guards at a new U.S.
compound in capital Taipei.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, Thomas Hodges, spokesman for the AIT Taipei Office,
which represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic
ties, said he had no immediate comment on the possible dispatch of the Marines
to Taipei.</P>
      <P>The AP report quoted Alexander  Huang of Taipei's Tamkang University as saying
that if it goes through, sending the Marines would signify an improvement in
Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>"With the Marine guards in place, the U.S. would be treating its Taipei facility
just like its other embassies and consulates despite the lack of diplomatic
relations," Huang said.</P>
      <P>The new U.S. compound in Taipei is a part of a large-scale State Department
overseas construction program. The facility, to be built in the city's Neihu
district, will replace the AIT's aging downtown compound.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said the ministry has
played an intermediary role in helping with the AIT's land acquisition for its
relocation plan. In the process, Yeh said, the ministry has learned a bit about
its plan to build security guard quarters.</P>
      <P>As the new AIT compound covers a large area, Yeh said it is understandable that
the AIT needs to build security guard quarters to ensure safety. As to whether
the quarters will be staffed by U.S. Marines, Yeh said the MOFA is not in a
position to give any comments.</P>
      <P>Since the U.S. switched its recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, there
have been no marine guards at its Taipei facility in keeping with its
deliberately low political profile.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of diplomatic relations, the two countries have maintained
close substantive ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New Kaohsiung MRT cutting into taxi drivers' incomes</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 20 (CNA)
04/20/08  15:21:59</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For many, the inauguration of the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit system was a day
worth celebrating.</P>
      <P>But for Kaohsiung taxi drivers, already jolted by the high price of gasoline
that may soon climb higher, the opening of the subway system was another blow
that has them worried about their futures.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Red Line, which began service on March 9, passes through many key
spots in the southern port city, including the train station, the high speed
rail station, the airport and a key shopping district, and will certainly
satisfy some of the transportation needs of Kaohsiung residents.</P>
      <P>But their convenience could come at the expense of the taxi drivers' incomes.</P>
      <P>"The impact (of the metro) has been huge. Sometimes a taxi driver can only earn
a little more than NT$1,000 per day, while before, we made an average of
NT$2,000 a day, " said Ye Guo-bin, a taxi dispatcher.</P>
      <P>He said that after deducting gasoline costs and the rental fee for the car,
drivers are left with only several hundred Taiwan dollars as their daily wage.</P>
      <P>"It is now so difficult to pick up fares that taxi drivers in Kaohsiung are
killing themselves because of the economic pressure, " he said in a telephone
interview with Central News Agency, citing one of his colleagues who committed
suicide by charcoal burning last week and two similar tragedies in March.</P>
      <P>According to Ye, more than 6,000 taxis are operating in the city of about 1.5
million people, and "the competition is very fierce."</P>
      <P>"To maintain their wage levels, taxi drivers can do nothing but operate their
cars for longer, " he said, with many of them spending nights in their vehicles.</P>
      <P>Asked how taxi drivers could improve their situations, one taxi driver named Mr.
Wu, who declined to give his full name, said in a phone interview that adopting
their vehicles to natural gas would help taxi drivers overcome the high price of
gasoline.</P>
      <P>He also expected that the situation would stabilize once metro fares were
normalized.</P>
      <P>During the Red Line's trial period from March 9 to April 6, all passengers were
allowed to ride the metro for free and in the three months starting from April
7, passengers owning an "I pass card", similar to the Easycard in Taipei, only
pay NT$12 for a one-way journey.</P>
      <P>Normal fares on the Red Line range from NT$20 to NT$60 depending on the distance
traveled.</P>
      <P>The taxi drivers suggested another possible source of new revenue, one that may
in fact be nothing more than a false hope.</P>
      <P>"We are also looking forward to the coming of the Chinese tourists, " Ye and Wu
said in unison, but Chinese tourists are currently required by law to stay in
their groups and travel on tour buses around the country, leaving few
opportunities to take taxis.</P>

      <P>Former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen, who is vying to become chairwoman of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said here Saturday that she hopes the DPP
will completely transform itself and become a party of integrity.</P>
      <P>Tsai, visiting Los Angeles at the invitation of the North America Taiwanese
Women's Association, said the DPP should return to its down-to-earth  simplicity
and strive to free itself from the bureaucratization and formalism that have
overtaken the party in recent years.</P>
      <P>She said the DPP, which suffered bruising defeats in the Jan. 12 legislative
polls and March 22 presidential election, should seek to operate more
efficiently and pragmatically and demonstrate that it is a party of
inclusiveness that can execute power.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP is a young party with a history of only 20 years, Tsai said
"the party should aim higher and strive to achieve greater goals."</P>
      <P>She said the party should also show greater magnanimity by tolerating people
from differing ethnic groups or with differing ideologies and points of view.</P>
      <P>The 52-year-old former chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council was the main
architect of the "special state-to-state" cross-Taiwan Strait relations theory
espoused by former President Lee Teng-hui in 1999.</P>
      <P>Tsai, in Los Angeles to take part in activities marking the 20th anniversary of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun should apologize
for adopting "blue-excluding opinion polls, " and the party should focus on
actually rooting out corruption rather than taling about it, a former DPP
legislator said Sunday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"It is a shame that a person who hurt the DPP so much is not willing to
apologize for his own mistake, " said former DPP legislator Lee Wen-chung,
referring to Yu's remarks at the end of a meeting held Saturday to review the
DPP's latest election setback.</P>
      <P>Yu refused to accept suggestions that the controversial polling method should be
abolished, arguing that "the DPP might as well give up conducting opinion polls,
should those excluding blue-leaning voters be eliminated."</P>
      <P>The polls, used to help determine party nominees for the Jan. 12 legislative
elections and March 22 presidential election, attempted to identify and exclude
supporters of the rival Kuomintang (KMT) from participating for fear that they
would manipulate the results in the KMT's favor.</P>
      <P>Following the DPP's drubbing in the legislative elections, however, many party
members criticized the polls for political labeling respondents and encouraging
the nomination of more extreme candidates.</P>
      <P>The polls, they said, not only excluded pan-KMT, or "blue, " supporters but also
independent voters.</P>
      <P>"Any system adopted by a party should be able to make the party even more
competitive. I think former chairman Yu, rather than objecting to review the
measure, should apologize publicly for adopting the opinion poll method," Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Lee contended that the main reason why the DPP lost decisively in the
presidential election was its failure to actually put its anti-corruption
campaign into practice.</P>
      <P>"We have seen so many meetings reviewing  the problem of corruption within the
party, but instead of talking the talk, you must walk the walk," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee added that the party's Central Review Committee and anti- corruption council
should immediately deal with the corruption cases. Committee members should
resign right away if they are not capable of doing so, he said.</P>
      <P>The former lawmaker, however, also gave the DPP credit for holding a series of
meetings to review their setbacks.</P>
      <P>"These  face-to-face  meetings  between  party members  and heavyweights showed
that the DPP would not turn its back to problems even there are some conflicts
and sparks," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Patience is needed to achieve transitional justice: civic group</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Civic groups and a former legislator said Sunday transitional justice takes time
and patience to achieve but should no longer be manipulated as a political tool
in elections and create conflicts.</P>
      <P>"It takes a lot of patience to deal with the tortured past and to achieve
transitional justice, " Lee Wen-chung, a former Democratic Progressive Party
legislator said at a seminar titled "Forgiveness and Mutual-trust: A Trans-party
List for Transitional Justice."</P>
      <P>The seminar was organized by the nongovernmental Mainlander Association, a group
founded to promote harmony between ethnic groups by second-generation members of
families who came to Taiwan around 1949 with the Kuomintang after it lost the
Chinese Civil War to the communists.</P>
      <P>Lee said he thought the incoming Kuomintang (KMT) administration was more
suitable than the outgoing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to deal with the
issue as the KMT is considered to be responsible for the human rights abuses of
the white terror era.</P>
      <P>"It is probably not possible to deal with the past from a legal perspective as
many documents are gone. But in terms of history, it is necessary to confront
the painful legacy of the past," he said.</P>
      <P>The "White Terror" refers to the suppression of political dissidents and
Taiwanese elite under martial law from May 19, 1949 to July 15, 1987.</P>
      <P>The "White Terror" left many Taiwanese with a deep-seated bitterness toward the
KMT, Chiang Kai-shek and, to a lesser extent, his son Chiang Ching-kuo, who
served as president from 1978 until his death in 1988.</P>
      <P>Chien Hsi-chieh, executive director of the Peacetime Foundation of Taiwan,  said
several  items in the Trans-party  List for Transitional Justice are things the
incoming government can do.</P>
      <P>He said the government should realize that transitional justice is unrelated to
the issue of independence from or unification with China but rather deeply
reflects the legacy of widespread or systematic human rights abuse in the past.</P>
      <P>The government,  according  to the list,  should  disclose information related
to the White Terror era and launch investigations as needed, he said.</P>
      <P>Chien said that transitional justice should be achieved through a series of
citizen's forums and that civil society in Taiwan should play the role of
supervising and helping national leaders to bring about justice.</P>
      <P>"Politicians should not abuse transitional justice and use it to increase their
own political clout or as an Automatic Teller Machine for votes, "he said.</P>
      <P>Tsai Shih-ping, a prominent author and former campaign spokesman of President-
elect Ma Ying-jeou, said that he personally agreed with the list and thought
that Ma should accept it.</P>
      <P>"The government needs patience when dealing with historic events. If not, such
events will be manipulated by political opportunists, "he said.</P>
      <P>Tsai suggested that President-elect Ma release all documents from KMT archives
for the general public to review.</P>
      <P>"The government should call on civil groups and society to examine the past and
achieve a holistic sense of justice for all citizens, to establish or renew
civil trust, " he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual whale watching season off Gueishan Island officially kicked off
Sunday, with hundreds of tourists and foreign media workers packing onto boats
to get a glimpse of whales and dolphins off Taiwan's northeastern coast.</P>
      <P>In addition to attracting numerous local tourists, the launch of the 2008
Gueishan Island Whale Watching campaign also attracted more than 100 tourists
from Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Germany and the United States.</P>
      <P>The tourists, including reporters and camera crews from three Japanese media
outlets, set off from Yilan's Wushih port in the morning,  cruised around
Gueishan Island --  located about 10 kilometers off the coast of Yilan County --
to watch whales.</P>
      <P>Their ships then docked at the volcanic islet, known literally as "Turtle
Mountain Island" because of its resemblance to a turtle, giving visitors a
chance to explore the island's well-preserved environment.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Northeast and Yilan Coast National Scenic Area
Administration, one of the sponsors of the activity, the Gueishan Island area is
one of the areas around Taiwan with the richest populations of cetaceans, with
some 17 species appearing on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Most of the 17 species -- including bottlenose dolphins and false killer whales
-- appear in waters near the Gueishan Island between April and September, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>During the spring, they said, tourists are welcome to land on Gueishan Island to
enjoy its rich flora in the island's southernmost section, where wild flowers,
cultivated flowers and other natural botanical species are now flourishing
around a small lake there.</P>
      <P>A former military base, Gueishan used to be out of bounds to civilians and
remained closed to tourists until 2001, when the government designated it as a
tourist spot. With a strict quota system in place limiting the number of
tourists allowed to visit the island, advance registration to go there is
required.</P>
      <P>Gueishan Island, which is known as an "ecological park on the sea, " is also
known as a paradise for underwater geological exploration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese yuan exchange to be launched at certain locations</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20 (CNA)
04/20/08  19:42:29

    <TEXT>
      <P>The exchange of Chinese yuan will be permitted at specific locations in Taiwan,
including airports and harbors, regardless of whether a currency clearance and
settlement mechanism is established, central bank sources indicated this week.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou pledged to allow full convertibility of the Chinese
currency in Taiwan during his election campaign, and the Central Bank of the
Republic of China (Taiwan) has drawn up plans to meet the goal.</P>
      <P>Central Bank Vice-Governor George Chou recently said the plan involved a two-
step approach, but he insisted that before any exchange of the yuan could take
place, Taiwan and China needed to agree on a currency clearance and settlement
mechanism.</P>
      <P>Central bank sources suggested recently, however, that limited currency
exchanges could be allowed before such a mechanism was established.</P>
      <P>"The central bank in the initial stage will impose restrictions on the amount of
currency exchanged and those who can apply for the exchanges, " said a central
bank official speaking on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>"Trading locations will be limited to harbors, airports, tourist attractions and
certain financial institutions, " the official said, describing the bank's draft
of an administrative procedure that will skirt the clauses on yuan
convertibility in the Act Governing Relations Between Peoples of the Taiwan Area
and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>The act requires that a clearence mechanism exists before allowing yuan to be
exchanged in Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>But with the legislature seemingly unwilling to amend the law and the
negotiations on a clearance mechanism expected to take time, the central bank
seems set to establish an interim system.</P>
      <P>The central bank suggested that under its plan for this initial stage, local
banks could only buy Chinese yuan, which is likely to disappoint the 4 million
Taiwanese who travel to China and 1 million China-based Taiwanese businessmen
who have a strong demand for the Chinese currency.</P>
      <P>"These restrictions in the first stage could also prevent the potential risk of
insufficient stock of yuan available in local banks, " said the official, who
stressed that these modest openings could be achieved without an agreement on a
currency clearance and settlement mechanism.</P>
      <P>Once provided with a stable supply of yuan, the central bank will permit local
banks to both buy and sell the Chinese currency in the second stage, the
official added.</P>
      <P>The central bank expects the demand for the exchange of the Chinese yuan and
Taiwan dollar to grow, as the incoming Kuomintang (KMT) administration has
promised to open Taiwan to more Chinese tourists, up to 3,000 to 10,000 per day.</P>
      <P>The only place where yuan can be legally exchanged at present are on the Taiwan-
controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu, which lie just off China's southeastern
coast. Individuals have been allowed to exchange up to 20,000 yuan since the act
was revised in October 2005.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmakers, eager to promote greater convertibility of the yuan in Taiwan,
has proposed its own revision of the act based on Hong Kong's approach, which
allowed the Chinese yuan to be exchanged there starting in 1995 without the
establishment of a clearence mechanism.</P>
      <P>"As long as local banks can balance their currency reserves, there is no urgent
need to establish the clearence mechanism, " KMT lawmaker Lee Jih-chu said.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong did not set up a clearence mechanism with China until 2003, six years
after it come under Chinese rule.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers also showed their support for the
opening of yuan convertibility.</P>
      <P>"We will assist in the revision of the act in full force," said DPP lawmaker Ker
Chien-ming.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should make a massive investment to improve Taiwan's tap water
infrastructure, even if the country's rate of access to potable water has
reached 91 percent, the level of developed countries, a local scholar said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the challenges faced by Taiwan in public water supplies at a forum
organized by National Cheng Kung University in the southern city of Tainan, Yeh
Hsuan-hsien, an environmental engineering professor at the university, warned
that Taiwan's potable water system had serious problems.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that Taiwan needs to find ways to store more rainwater because while
the island's average annual rainfall is as high as 2,500 millimeters, 75 percent
of the rainfall occurs between May and October, particularly during the typhoon
season from July and September.</P>
      <P>If the government cannot build large reservoirs due to strong opposition from
local environmental groups, it should still try to build small flatland
reservoirs and ponds, he suggested.</P>
      <P>Yeh also noted that water quality issues exist. He said algae in some reservoirs
produce odors and worsen water quality and that farm fertilizers  often pollute
ground  water,  resulting  in high concentrations of nitrate nitrogen that can
pose health threats.</P>
      <P>Strong heavy rains sometimes also worsen the water quality of reservoirs in
northern, central and southern Taiwan, which he said would cause water
shortages.</P>
      <P>He cited the example of a 19-day water shortage in 2004 in the greater Taoyuan
area in northern Taiwan after a typhoon caused heavy silt run-off into Shihmen
Reservoir that resulted in a sudden deterioration of its water quality.</P>
      <P>A big problem, Yeh said, is that water prices in Taiwan are extremely low and
thus the government does not have enough funds to replace water pipelines and
equipment.</P>
      <P>This has prompted many to buy bottled water or water filters at home because
they are suspicious of tap water quality, he observed.</P>
      <P>Yeh suggested that the government set up a special research and development
agency to work with advanced countries to carry out the large investment
projects.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Once called the "dark village, " the Smangus Tribe in Hsinchu County has become
a shining example of Taiwan's illumination renovation, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ahead of World Earth Day on April 22, the Smangus demonstrated advanced
illumination concepts and equipment such as LED lighting devices that are eco-
friendly and conserve energy.</P>
      <P>One of the last areas in Taiwan to be connected to electricity, the Smangus
village relied on standard, high power-consumption fixtures,  like T9
fluorescent  lamps,  that caused occasional blackouts.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Energy, Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) and Industrial Technology
Research Institute recently decided, however, to turn the remote village into a
model for illumination, replacing the old devices with electricity-saving bulbs.</P>
      <P>The heads of the tribe stressed that the renovation could improve both the
stability of electricity supply and energy conservation and said the change was
in line with the philosophy of their ancestors, who lived in tune with nature.</P>
      <P>The bureau noted that the new fixtures lowered electricity bills, and saved on
the costs  of building  infrastructure  for the neighborhood, while maintaining
the original landscape by integrating the high-tech lighting with the natural
environment.</P>
      <P>Adopting similar energy-saving lighting devices around Taiwan could potentially
save between 30 percent to 80 percent of the 26 billion kilowatt/hours of
electricity used for illumination annually, which represents about 12 percent of
Taiwan's total electricity consumption of 221.4 billion kilowatt/hours,
according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>"The energy saving lighting could also help reduce carbon dioxide emissions, "
the bureau noted.</P>
      <P>To realize such savings, the ministry has worked to promote both the energy
efficiency and standards for energy-saving products, while launching a green
revolution in illumination this year, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>These efforts  include assisting  local public and private organizations to
replace incandescent lamps, which are high energy consuming, and promoting the
use of energy saving LED products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Direct Taiwan-China flights' designation unclear: KMT vice chairman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman and Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman-
designate Chiang Pin-kung denied Sunday a Japanese newspaper report quoting him
as saying that direct flights between Taiwan and China will be designated as
"direct route flights."</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, he did not mention to Asahi Shimbun during a recent
interview that future direct flights across the Taiwan Strait will be designated
as "direct route flights, " and suggested the term may have come from a
misunderstanding of his words.</P>
      <P>To his knowledge, Chiang said, "cross-strait flights" was the designation agreed
upon by both Taiwan and China in previous rounds of two-way talks on the issue
to avoid the political complications of calling them either "international" or
"domestic" flights.</P>
      <P>Chiang has been appointed by President-elect Ma Ying-jeou to lead the semi-
official  SEF,  which is responsible for cross-strait exchanges in the absence
of official ties.</P>
      <P>Ma has pledged to implement direct flights and shipping links across the strait
as soon as possible after he assumes presidency on May 20, beginning with direct
weekend charter flights from July 4, then daily charter flights and eventually
daily regularly scheduled flights.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Kuo-liang, the KMT's acting legislative caucus whip, said earlier Sunday
that Taiwan's people are more concerned about whether direct cross-strait
charters every weekend begin as planned in early July than how they should be
designated.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's  public  has high  expectations  for  a quick establishment of
direct air links between the two sides, the new administration's failure to
achieve the aim of opening weekend charter flights from July would disappoint
many people, he said.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview broadcast Saturday by Taipei-based TVBS, Chiang said
that he would visit China as soon as possible after taking over as SEF chairman.
He asserted that regularly scheduled daily cross-strait flights will be
implemented some time within the next year.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman-designate said he would resume institutionalized dialogue with
his Chinese counterpart, the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) in June or July on a wide range of issues, including
pushing for the opening of SEF offices in China.</P>
      <P>Talks between the SEF and ARATS ground to a halt in 1999 after former President
Lee Teng-hui described the reslationship between Taiwan and China as a "special
state-to-state relationship" earlier that same year.</P>
      <P>Kuan Pi-ling, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
which will become the main opposition party after May 20, contended that Taiwan-
China flights should be named in an impartial way to technically put aside the
dispute surrounding the sovereignty dispute between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"The key point concerning the issue is that both sides must be treated on an
equal footing and with parity," Kuan stressed.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Historica and the National Taiwan Museum plan to honor Wang Chin-ho, a 93
-year-old doctor who has devoted most of his life to patients with blackfoot
disease in southwestern Taiwan since the 1960s, with an interview and a photo
exhibition.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Historica in the central city of Nantou will conduct oral history
interviews with Wang to collect information about the history of blackfoot
disease in Taiwan, with interview transcripts to be published at the end of this
year.</P>
      <P>To allow more people in Taiwan to acquire knowledge about the outbreak and
treatment of blackfoot disease,  the Taipei-based National Taiwan Museum will
hold a retrospective photo exhibition featuring Wang's medical achievements in
March 2009 to mark the museum's 100th anniversary.</P>
      <P>Wang signed an agreement Sunday at a ceremony in Taipei with Taiwan Historica
Director Hsieh Chia-liang and National Taiwan Museum Curator Hsiao Chung-huang
in which he promised to participate in the projects.</P>
      <P>Wang, who has being respectfully called the Father of Blackfoot Disease for his
contributions to the treatment of the disease, was born in 1916 and studied
medical science in Japan before returning to his hometown in Beimen township in
the southern county of Tainan in 1943 to practice medicine.</P>
      <P>Blackfoot disease, an endemic peripheral vascular disease caused by drinking
arsenic-contaminated water, appeared in the southwestern coast of Taiwan in the
1960s.</P>
      <P>Sponsored by Lilian Dickson, founder of Mustard Seed Inc., an international
evangelical Christian missions organization, Wang soon began to provide free
medical services to patients with the disease at the Beimen Free Clinic of
Christian Mustard Seed, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>During the period, Wang went beyond the call of duty in caring for blackfoot
disease patients. He was known to carry those who couldn't walk on his back to
the clinic for treatment, make coffins for families of the deceased who couldn't
afford them, and set up a handicraft training center to help those who became
disabled because of the disease to gain practical skills, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, Hsieh said he visited Wang and decided to send people to
interview him and record oral history to make more people aware of his
achievements and have them emulate his good deeds.</P>
      <P>Wang retired in 1996 at the age of 81 and closed his clinic. It was later
converted into the Taiwan Blackfoot Disease Memorial and has attracted more than
60,000 people to visit since it was opened at the end of last September.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian traveled to the southern port city of Kaohsiung Sunday
to visit a seven-year-old girl who has bravely battled a genetic disease called
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) since birth.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived at the house of the seven-year-old named Lee Pei on Kaohsiung
City's Min Sheng 1st Road around noon and gave the child a red envelope as a
token of his best wishes and encouragement. They also exchanged a "high-five" in
a warm atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Lee has suffered from the rare, multi-system genetic disease</P>
      <P>since she was born. She was diagnosed at birth with tumors in her brain, heart
and kidneys.</P>
      <P>Doctors operated on her when she was one month old to remove a life-threatening
tumor -- hence saving her life and allowing her to live on to the present date.</P>
      <P>Due to the tumors in her brain, Lee often has seizures and her mental
development has been stifled, with her intellectual level equal to that of an
average two-year-old.</P>
      <P>She is scheduled to attend a special school for the mentally challenged in
September this year.</P>
      <P>Lee's mother, a high school nursing teacher,  offered her gratitude to the Chen
administration's efforts over the past several years to help families of
patients of rare diseases, major illnesses and injuries.</P>
      <P>The mother  also asked Chen about  the condition  of the wheelchair-bound first
lady Wu Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>"The best condition for her is to maintain the 'status quo, '" Chen answered.</P>
      <P>Lee's mother was given a "Great Love" award by the Ministry of the Interior in
August 2006 for her unselfish devotion to her daughter. She visited the
Presidential Office in 2007 to meet with Chen to promote the cause of patients,
and Chen at the time promised to visit the child in person.</P>
      <P>TSC causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as
the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. A combination of symptoms may include
seizures, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, and lung
and kidney disease.</P>
      <P>TSC is caused by mutations on either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode
the proteins hamartin and tuberin respectively and prevent them from fulfilling
their roles as tumor growth suppressors and regulators of cell proliferation and
differentiation.</P>

      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kung will travel to China via Hong
Kong next week to thank Taiwan businessmen based there for their votes for the
KMT ticket in the March 22 presidential election, a KMT official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>KMT Mainland Affairs Department Director Chang Jung-kung made the announcement
in a press release.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Chiang will leave for China next Thursday and visit
Shanghai, Kunshan, Xiamen and Shenzhen, where a large number of Taiwan
businessmen are clustered, to thank them for their support of President-elect Ma
Ying-jeou and Vice President-elect Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>The Ma-Siew ticket beat their ruling Democratic Progressive Party rivals by more
than 2.21 million votes, seizing a record high 7.65 million votes, or 58 percent
of the total, in the presidential race.</P>
      <P>Chang said that more than 200,000 China-based Taiwan businessmen returned to
Taiwan to cast their ballots for the Ma-Siew ticket on March 22, and that the
KMT fully appreciated their firm backing for the pair and for their deep
interest  in Taiwan's  political development.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who doubles as convener of the KMT's Taiwan businessmen center, has been
appointed to take over as chief of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) when the Ma administration takes office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Ma and Siew touted closer trade and economic ties between Taiwan and China
throughout the campaign and are expected to implement direct cross-strait air
links and shipping services, which would be advantageous for the many Taiwanese
businessmen with operations in China.</P>
      <P>The SEF, responsible for cross-strait exchanges in its dealings with the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), is
expected to play a prominent role after the inauguration of Ma's administration.</P>
      <P>Two-way SEF-ARATS talks have been stalled since 1999 when former President Lee
Teng-hui angered Beijing by terming Taiwan-China ties as a "special state-to-
state relationship" earlier that same year.</P>

      <P>More than 3,000 people in nine counties around Taiwan joined together to clean
up shores Sunday to observe the April 22 Earth Day.</P>
      <P>The Society of Wildness, which organized the shore-cleaning campaign said in a
press release that the activities were held simultaneous at shores in the
counties of Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Yilan
and Hualien.</P>
      <P>Beside picking up garbage, the participants were guided by volunteers to learn
the flora on the shores, birds and fish living in the tidal zones and the
delicate ecosystem of the shores.</P>
      <P>Lin Yao-kuo, president of the society, said in Taipei that the theme of this
year's Earth Day is to enhance people's awareness about the problems facing the
country's shores.</P>
      <P>Besides littering with garbage, Lin said Taiwan's shores are lined with concrete
wave breakers, man-made harbors, while the natural shores are disappearing, not
least the coral reefs which house many fish.</P>
      <P>Lin said the conservation of the shore couldn't be done by an one-day cleaning-
up campaign, but it can help people to realize that they can help protect the
island's shores by not littering, not taking any natural object away from the
shore and leading an environmentally friendly lifestyle.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng welcomed the first part of the new
Cabinet lineup that was announced by Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan Monday,
saying that experience is what counts the most when starting a new
administration.</P>
      <P>Discounting doubts that Liu was forming an administrative team made up of "old
bureaucrats, " Wang said the new appointees were all academics or technocrats
with rich administrative experience, adding that these Cabinet members should
live up to the expectations of the country.</P>
      <P>Noting that experience is most valuable during the transitional period when
political stability is vital, Wang said the incoming administration, set to be

(KMT) legislative caucus, also defended Liu's Cabinet appointments, saying that
although they were "old faces, " those former officials were ready to
immediately begin work by bringing their invaluable administrative experience to
bear particularly on the efforts to rev up the domestic economy.</P>
      <P>The majority of the 17 ministers-designate announced by Liu Monday had
previously served as vice ministers under the former KMT government prior to

    <HEADLINE>Nearly 9% of foreign laborers in Taipei fail physical examination</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 9 percent of foreign laborers in Taipei City failed their physical
examinations in 2007 and among them, 30 have been repatriated, a Taipei City
Government health official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yung-wei, director of disease control under the Department of Health, said
that of the 33,799 foreign laborers who underwent physical examinations in 2007,
8.76 percent, or 2,962 of them, failed the health checks.</P>
      <P>Most of them failed because they had intestinal parasites, he said. In the
screening for 10 types of parasites, 2,814 workers were found to have
blastocystis hominis, a single-cell parasite that infects the gastrointestinal
tract of human and animals,  he disclosed. Symptoms associated with the
infection include diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia and vomiting.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that people infected with blastocystis hominis are usually prone to
anemia, but that foreign laborers employed in construction who are infected with
the parasite pose no risks to their employers. However if they are working as
domestic helpers or caretakers, then their employers should be careful not to
contract the infection and the foreign workers should wash their hands
frequently, he added.</P>
      <P>Wang said that 30 foreign laborers, on X-ray examination, were found to have
tuberculosis, a communicable disease. Those workers were repatriated, he said.</P>
      <P>Foreign laborers who fail their health checks are allowed to remain in Taiwan if
their health problems can be treated and cured, he added.</P>
      <P>According to the relevant regulations, foreign laborers are required to take
physical examinations six, 18 and 30 months after their arrival in Taiwan. The
health checks include chest X-ray examination, tests for the AIDS virus,
syphilis, parasites, and leprosy, and a general condition appraisal.</P>

      <P>The EasyCard has been a hit in Matsu since it was introduced on the outlying
island at the end of last month, the Taipei Smart Card Corp. (TSCC) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The TSCC, which issues the card, said that it has been used about 252 times a
day on average in Matsu since it was made valid for use there on March 28.</P>
      <P>Almost 25 percent of those using the EasyCard on Matsu have been visitors to the
island, which illustrates the effectiveness of integrating the electronic
transportation fee collection system, the TSCC said.</P>
      <P>To date, more than 2,300 of the multi-purpose cards have been issued -- mostly
to students -- on Matsu Island, according to the company.</P>
      <P>In the first phase, the EasyCard will be valid for use on public buses in
certain parts of Matsu, and will then extend to all ferry services on the
outlying island from September.</P>
      <P>From that date, Matsu residents will also be able to use their EasyCards in
Taipei City on public buses, the MRT and the Maokong Gondola, the TSCC said,
adding that visitors to Taiwan's capital will even be able to use the card at
public libraries and to gain entry to the Taipei Zoo.</P>
      <P>Persons interested in purchasing EasyCards can visit the TSCC's Web site at
www.tscc.com.tw or call its toll-free customer service line at

      <P>Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan announced Monday 17 members of his Cabinet,
the selections based on their "integrity, competence, past record and the spirit
of teamwork," and gave his assurance that the new administration will be in full
cooperation upon taking office May 20 without a grace period.</P>
      <P>Liu told a press conference that in addition to these qualities, "they  also
share  a common  consensus  on the policies  of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou and
his running mate Vincent Siew."</P>
      <P>Liu first announced that Paul Chiu, a former finance minister, will be his
deputy, commending Chiu as "the ideal candidate" for the vice premiership. Liu
said he believes that Chiu will help make Taiwan's financial sector more
vigorous and efficient.</P>
      <P>Among the 17 designates, five of the new Cabinet members, including Hsieh
Hsiang-chuan (secretary-general of the Executive Yuan), Tsai Hsun-hsiung
(minister without portfolio), Yiin Chii-ming (minister of economic affairs), Mao

      <P>The selection of Francisco Ou as the next foreign minister has gained
overwhelming approval, with two former foreign ministers praising him Monday as
the best qualified candidate for the job given his solid experience in the
diplomatic arena.</P>
      <P>"Without any doubt, he is the best person to be foreign minister as he is a
highly experienced and skilled diplomat," said former Foreign Minister John
Chiang, who now serves as a Kuomintang legislator.</P>
      <P>Describing Ou as a "technocrat, " Chiang said he was ideal for the job as it is
a profession-oriented position and Ou's diplomatic skills are well known within
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Chiang was foreign minister from 1996 to 1997,
during which period Ou served as his deputy.</P>
      <P>Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu, also a former foreign minister, agreed with
Chiang, saying that Ou is the most suitable candidate for the job.</P>
      <P>"I am extremely delighted to see such a talented person appointed as foreign
minister," Hu said.</P>
      <P>Hu recalled that during his two-year stint as foreign minister from 1997 to
1999, Ou made a remarkable contribution to building friendships with countries
that had no diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ou was best known for his sacrifice and dedication to diplomatic work, Hu said,
noting that the senior diplomat was once trapped by a flood in Fiji and could
not be contacted for over 24 hours.</P>
      <P>The 68-year-old diplomat,  who graduated from the National Chengchi University's
Department of Diplomacy, speaks perfect Spanish and has served in various
important posts, including representative to Spain and director-general of the
MOFA's Department of Central and South American Affairs. He is now Taiwan's
ambassador to Guatemala.</P>
      <P>Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan announced 17 members of the Cabinet lineup
Monday. He stressed that experience is what counts the most when starting a new
administration. The new cabinet is to be inaugurated May 20.</P>
      <P>The 17 new appointees include Vice Premier Paul Chiu, Secretary General of the
Executive Yuan Steve Hsieh, Minister of the Interior Liao Feng-te, Minister of

Economic Affairs Yiin Chii- ming, Minister of Transportation and Communications

    <HEADLINE>Increase in grain cultivation to help deter price hikes: academic</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 21 (CNA)
04/21/08  16:44:35
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An academic said Sunday that international cereal price hikes might slow as more
countries work to increase grain production.</P>
      <P>Lin Kuo-ching, a professor of the Department of Agricultural Economics at
National Taiwan University, noted that the recent international cereal crisis is
due mainly to the fact that more and more farmers around the world have switched
to corn cultivation in order to produce ethanol as biomass energy amid soaring
oil prices, which has affected the production of other cereals.</P>
      <P>"The other main reason is climate change, which has resulted in the reduction of
cereal crops in several countries," Lin said, citing the example of Australia,
which has suffered a drought for the last few years.</P>
      <P>"Since many countries are boosting their grain production, the future prices of
cereals will largely depend on the extent of climate change," Lin went on.</P>
      <P>According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations,
global rice production is expected to increase by 12 million tons this year, or
1.8 percent, if weather patterns remain normal for the rest of the year.</P>
      <P>The FAO has estimated that the world's major rice producers, including
Bangladesh,  China,  India,  Indonesia, Myanmar,  the Philippines  and Thailand
will see their rice production rise significantly this year, with many other
parts of the world also increasing production, including Africa, Latin America
and Europe.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-chien,  a professor  of finance at Hsuan Chuang University, said many
poor countries are blaming the subsidy policy that rich countries are adopting
to boost production of biomass energy, which encourages farmers to grow corn on
land normally used for cereal cultivation, a policy that has also been blamed
for the hikes in cereal prices.</P>
      <P>However, Chen noted that the cereal crisis might mean a comeback for genetic
modification, as this can produce bigger harvests from limited land to feed the
global population.</P>
      <P>Noting that genetically modified crops can resist insects and can produce more
returns,  Chen estimated  that more biotechnology companies will dedicate their
efforts in this field.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, You Sheng-feng, deputy director of Agriculture and Food Agency under
the Council of Agriculture, noted that there is limited space for rice price
hikes, as the country's rice production will reach 800,000 tons in its first
crop of the year, due in May.</P>
      <P>"In addition, the government has been releasing stored rice onto the market and
is discussing the future of the 220,000 hectares of fallow land around Taiwan to
cope with the rising prices, " You said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Telecare solution to Taiwan's aging society: health minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
04/21/08  17:29:29
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The minister of the Department of Health said Monday that telecare is the
solution to Taiwan's fast-aging society, as the crisis of the aging population
is imminent and the government has to adopt counter-measures sooner rather than
later.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an international conference on policy and service delivery models
for telecare, Department of Health Minister Hou Sheng-mou said that "crisis is
inevitable if a country cannot tackle in advance problems that are set to
happen, " referring to the tendency of the falling birthrate and the aging
population in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that the telecare project proposed by the Department of Health in 2007
is an initiative aimed at solving this problem, at least in part.</P>
      <P>"The telecare project is the first functional network in Taiwan that provides
integrated and ubiquitous care services 24 hours a day by combining community
care, home care and institution care, " Hou said.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech at the conference, Department of Health Deputy Minister Chen
Tzay-jinn said that "care services are not the responsibility of the medical
system alone."</P>
      <P>The whole of society  should move toward shared care and integrated  service  as
well  as improved  accessibility  and cost-effectiveness of health services in
order to achieve the goal of healthy aging and fulfill demands for long-term
care, he added.</P>
      <P>However, Chen admitted that there are several limitations for Taiwan's telecare
pilot program, which include the lack of reliable financing support for long-
term care, insufficient capacity for care devices and health electronics
development, and the language or digital access barrier for migrant caregivers
and the disabled.</P>
      <P>Wanfang Hospital Superintendent Chiu Wen-ta, who introduced the current
situation  of Taiwan's  Telecare Pilot Project in his presentation, said that
although the promotion of telecare in Taiwan is in its primary stage, there is
no doubt that it is the best solution for the needs of a fast-aging society.</P>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development  Minister Ho Mei-yueh noted that
the speed of the aging of the population in Taiwan is so rapid that it is
creating a very serious problem.</P>
      <P>In 2007, 10 percent of Taiwan's 23 million people were aged over 65 years, Ho
said, a number that will have doubled in just 20 years. By 2050, 33 percent of
the population will be over 65, she added.</P>
      <P>"It is not only a serious problem but also a great business opportunity," Ho
said.</P>
      <P>She noted that if Taiwan can deal with the problem as soon as possible by
developing a well-organized  telecare system,  the implementation of such a
system will facilitate the development of the  health  3C  industry  --  health-
implemented  computers, health-implemented  communication  technology  and
health  care electronics -- and Taiwan will then be able to export its
technology and experience to other countries.</P>

      <P>Non-governmental agencies responded favorably Monday to the choice of new heads
of the Department of Health (DOH) and the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), but
were less enthusiastic about the candidate to lead the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>Premier-designate  Liu Chao-shiuan on Monday named Dean of National Taiwan
University College of Medicine Lin Fang-yue as minister in charge of the DOH,
and Jennifer Ju-hsuan Wang, a lawyer and chief of the Awakening Foundation, as
head of the CLA. Shen Shih-hung, the current Taipei City Environmental
Protection Bureau director, was selected as minister of the Environmental
Protection Administration, on a list of 17 new cabinet members announced by Liu
to date.</P>
      <P>"I have a great expectation for Lin Fang-yue, as he is considered a methodical
and perseverant person who has high work standards," said Lin Ching-li, the
director of the public affairs section of the John Tang Foundation, which has
been promoting the public health since its inception in 1984.</P>
      <P>"We hope that he will make the DOH more vibrant," she said in a telephone
interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Another non-governmental organization, which focuses on labor rights, expressed
similar sentiments regarding Wang's appointment.</P>
      <P>"We expect much from Wang, as she has a progressive image," said Gu Yu-ling, the
secretary-general of the Taiwan International Workers' Association. Wang has
long been involved in advocacy for the rights of minority groups such as
homosexuals and female workers, Gu noted.</P>
      <P>"We will observe the approach to the rights of foreign caregivers as a key
indicator to Wang's policies," Gu added.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, about 160,000 caretakers, mostly from Southeast Asian countries, have
scant protection under the Labor Standards Law.</P>
      <P>The response to the appointment of the 59-year-old Shen to head the EPA was
cooler, with a Green Party official expressing reservations about Shen's past
work record.</P>
      <P>"I don't recall any important achievements by Shen during his stint in the
Taipei City environmental bureau and I"m not optimistic about his appointment,"
Pan Han-shen, the secretary-general of the Green Party Taiwan, told the CNA.</P>

      <P>Fifteen students of the National Taishan Senior High School were injured early
Monday when the bus carrying them to school crashed into a combination truck on
the Dahan Bridge, which links the two neighboring cities of Banciao and
Hsinchuang.</P>
      <P>Firemen and other emergency workers sent the 15 students, including four girls,
to three hospitals for treatment. Most of the students suffered lacerations to
the face, chest and knee. Several of them had to have stitches to close the
wounds.</P>
      <P>According to police, a city bus owned by Sanchung Bus Co. was carrying more than
30 students from Banciao city to their school, Taishan Senior Hish School in
Taishan township, when the accident occurred.</P>
      <P>Kung Chun-min, the 38-year-old bus driver, said that as he drove onto the Dahan
Bridge, he found that the roadway was covered with a film of grease.</P>
      <P>"I was driving at 40 kilometers per hour when I noticed that the truck ahead of
me had stopped. I started to brake from 100 meters away, but still could not
stop the bus," he said.</P>
      <P>Chiu Ching-han, 33, the driver of the combination truck, said he also noticed
the film of grease on the bridge and had stopped the truck in order to caution
traffic policemen on the other side of the road about the potential hazard.</P>
      <P>"The accident would not have occurred if I had minded my own business," he said.</P>
      <P>Police said the grease on the bridge was probably the main cause of the
accident, but they could not be certain whether it had been left by a
construction team or was the result of a previous vehicular accident.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A longtime advocate of women's rights and gender equality has been appointed
Taiwan's new minister of labor affairs, one of four females who will comprise
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's new cabinet.</P>
      <P>Jennifer Ju-hsuan Wang, 45, was appointed minister in charge of the Cabinet-
level Council of Labor Affairs by Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan Monday.</P>
      <P>She and other Cabinet members under the incoming Kuomintang (KMT) administration
of Ma will take office on May 20. The other three women minister-designate named
Monday will serve in the positions of minister of justice, chairwoman of the
National Youth Commission and chief of the Directorate  General of Budget,
Accounting  and Statistics.</P>
      <P>Wang, who has been a women's rights lawyer and an activist with several
organizations championing gender equality, including in the workplace, said she
accepted the appointment because she believes the post will allow her greater
opportunity to take care of the less advantaged people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Expressing she had mixed feelings about joining the government, Wang said she
nevertheless realizes that the tasks entrusted upon her will be heavy and the
road ahead is a long one.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang's appointment was met favorably in general by labor activist
groups in the country.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Chuang-chih, secretary-general of the Taiwan Confederation of Trade
Unions, said Wang's expertise and experience in handling issues pertaining to
women's rights could be a plus to governmental efforts to address labor issues,
such as career women's work time, maternity leave and wages.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out, however, that gender equality is not the only issue involved
in the country's labor affairs.</P>
      <P>Considering that Wang is more or less a stranger to the labor sector, Hsieh
suggested that Wang meet with representatives of various labor groups prior to
the May 20 inauguration to hear views from the grass-roots labor sector so as to
help her shape her policies once taking office.</P>
      <P>Sun You-lien, secretary-general of the Taiwan Labor Front, urged Wang to pay
closer  attention  to issues  pertaining  to the implementation of labor
retirement pension, the enactment of laws governing labor unions and settlement
of disputes between employers and employees.</P>
      <P>Sun said that some KMT legislators have submitted a number of draft bills, aimed
at helping rev up the flagging domestic economy, that would instead hurt the
rights and interests of the working class.</P>
      <P>He urged Wang to bear in mind, once she takes office, workers' rights and
interests.</P>
      <P>Ku Yu-ling, chairwoman of the Taiwan International Workers Association (TIWA) ,
said her group attaches great expectations to Wang's performance in coming
years.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, TIWA, which serves more than 300,000 migrant workers working in
Taiwan, will not relent in checking and monitoring the performances of the
Council of Labor Affairs in the future, " Ku added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>20% of first-graders nearsighted</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a survey of Taiwanese students' eyesight in 2006 show that 19.6
percent of first-graders suffer from myopia, according to a statement released
by the Department of Health (DOH) Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted among students aged between 6 and 18 every two or three
years by the Bureau of Health Promotion under the DOH.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey and of the previous ones show that nearsightedness in
Taiwan has three special features: occurring at a young  age,  with high
prevalence  and of a high degree  of nearsightedness.</P>
      <P>However, a different survey carried out a year earlier shows that Taiwanese
people do not have enough common sense to cope with this common eye problem,
according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The results of a survey on the public's knowledge of myopia, conducted via
telephone interviews in 2007, show that only 8.3 percent of the 4,026
respondents answered correctly to three test questions on myopia. Among the
respondents, females, older people and people with lower education levels showed
less common sense on myopia than the other respondents.</P>
      <P>Some 29.9 percent knew that corrective surgery for high-degree nearsightedness,
which is a popular treatment in Taiwan, cannot prevent complications of existing
high degree myopia.</P>
      <P>Only 35.7 percent knew that people with nearsightedness of over 600 degrees have
the chance of getting retinal degeneration or detachment, while 46.6 percent
knew that a high degree of myopia is more likely to happen to children who
become nearsighted at a younger age than those who do not suffer until later in
life.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, most nearsightedness in Taiwanese students is axial
myopia, which is due to eye axis elongation. Corrective surgery can make changes
to only corneal curves, not to the elongated axis.</P>
      <P>People with high-degree nearsightedness, even if they have corrective surgery,
are still likely to get complications related to elongated and degenerated axis,
such as retinal detachment, glaucoma, cataract and macular degeneration.</P>
      <P>The statement reminded the public to pay more attention to the eye health of
their children, many of whom over-strain their eyes at school,  surfing the
Internet, watching television and playing computer games.</P>

      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, a vice chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT) and chairman-designate
of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), will visit five cities in southeastern
China later this week, a KMT official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chiang will visit Shanghai and Kunshan in Jiangsu Province, and Xiamen in Fujian
Province, Shenzhen and Tungguan in Guangdong Province, where most of the Taiwan
businessmen operating in China converge, according to Chang Jung-kung, deputy
executive director of the KMT's Policy Committee and director of the party's
Department of Chinese Affairs.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that more than 200,000 Taiwanese businessmen operating in China
returned to Taiwan to vote in the March 22 presidential election, which saw KMT
candidate Ma Ying-jeou score a decisive victory by a margin of 2.21 million
votes against his ruling Democratic Progressive Party rival, Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>"Their  concerns  for Taiwan's  political  development  are admirable," Chang
said, adding that Chiang will express appreciation on behalf of Ma to the Taiwan
businessmen during his five-city visit April 24-28.</P>
      <P>Observers said they are watching whether Chiang, SEF chairman-designate, will
meet with high-ranking Chinese officials. The SEF is a semi-official body set up
by Taiwan to handle civic exchanges with China in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Chiang has said he hopes the stalled cross-strait dialogue, which was suspended
in 1999 after then-President Lee Teng-hui described cross-strait ties as
"special state-to-state relations," can be resumed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A local university plans to hold a series of activities Tuesday aimed at urging
the public to change its diet from meat-based to vegetarian in observance of
World Earth Day.</P>
      <P>National Chi Nan University in the central county of Nantou said in a statement
Sunday  that the activities,  to be held in collaboration with the Nantou county
government from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., will begin with a documentary entitled
"Devour the Earth, " which shows the environmental  impact of human activities
and meat-based diets on the planet.</P>
      <P>The documentary will be followed by three speeches on the impact of global
warming,  green consumption,  and a healthy  diet, respectively, according to
the statement.</P>
      <P>The activities will end with a vegetarian lunch provided to all participants as
part of the university's efforts to encourage local residents to eat more fruits
and vegetables rather than meat, on the basis of the argument that the meat
production process generates a high volume of carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>The production of one kilogram of beef results in 36.4 kilograms of carbon
dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas, a Japanese study showed. One kilogram
of beef also requires the same amount of energy as it takes to light a 100-watt
bulb for nearly three weeks, the study indicated.</P>
      <P>The university's statement cited a United Nations report that said Taiwan is
located in an area that is at high risk because of global warming.</P>
      <P>The Earth's average temperature has risen 0.6 degrees in the past 100 years,
while Taiwan's average temperature has climbed 1.3 degrees Celsius over the same
period, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The organizers of Tuesday's activities are also urging the public to follow the
recent advice offered by Rajendra Pachauri, head of the U.N.'s scientific panel
on climate change -- "don't eat meat, ride a bike, and be a frugal shopper" --
to help "brake global warming."</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the university also plans to launch a signature drive to recruit one
million people to join its anti-global warming efforts, and will give away 200
cups and chopsticks for people to carry around rather than use disposable eating
utensils.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the university will turn off its lights for one hour on Earth Day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan signs MOC with Intel to promote WiMAX application</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Global chipmaker giant Intel signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) with
Taiwan Monday to jointly develop WiMAX service applications for the
telecommunication sector in Taiwan, with a portion of the funding coming from a
separate but complementary US$500 million investment and procurement program
from 2008 to 2013.</P>
      <P>Sean Maloney, Intel's executive vice president and chief sales and marketing
officer, who met with President-elect Ma Ying-jeou earlier the day, signed the
agreement with the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on behalf of the U.S.
microchip maker.</P>
      <P>He noted that Intel plans to spend US$500 million on procurement and investment
in Taiwan from 2008-2013 to promote the local WiMAX industry, citing Taiwan as
an important strategic partner of Intel in the advancement of the development of
the global WiMAX industry.</P>
      <P>"Intel and its Taiwanese partners have produced global standards that make
technology more affordable," Maloney said, pointing out the hundreds of millions
of people around the world who can enjoy such technology, much of which is
designed and manufactured in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also referred to system integration and the compatibility of chip standards
as major technical challenges that need to be solved as part of the cooperation
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The MOC will be carried out both to advance Taiwan's technology to new frontiers
and to strengthen the relationship between Taiwanese manufacturers and the
global WiMAX industry, the MOEA announced at the signing.</P>
      <P>By forming the partnership with the global leader in microchip design, the
ministry went on, the alliance will help create a business entity established by
the MOEA, Intel and the domestic private sectors to develop and test innovative
applications, mobile devices  and system  integration  frameworks  based upon
WiMAX technology, and to offer consulting services for WiMAX Network
Infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranks second in the world for investment  in this particular technology,
with a potential investment value of US$664 million (NT$20.25 billion) by 2010.
WiMAX is a telecommunications technology that provides wireless data over long
distances in a variety  of ways,  from point-to-point  links  to full mobile
cellular-type access.</P>
      <P>"Since 2005, Taiwan and Intel have worked in partnership to promote the WiMAX
industry, said Shih Yen-shiang, MOEA administrative deputy minister, referring
to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed between the MOEA and Intel in
2005, since which time Intel has helped local makers to develop WiMAX equipment
while organizing expositions and conferences on the technology.</P>
      <P>Shih said the domestic private sector's achievements boosted by the MOU, such as
the latest innovations and devices, will be showcased in the "2008 WiMAX Expo,
Taipei" set to take place June 2-6.</P>
      <P>"Those devices will ensure that consumers are able to buy high-quality and
reasonably-priced WiMAX products, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Diverse applications and broadband networks, Shih added, are the keys to the
global WiMAX market shares in the technical- application industry.</P>
      <P>Intel established Intel Innovation Center in 2003 to work with the Taiwanese
telecommunication and information technology sectors to develop a range of
applications including mobile computing, industry networks and home digital
services.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese technology companies have been collaborating with Intel since the
1980s, dating back to the very establishment of the Internet to as recently as
the Wi-Fi broadband services launched five years ago, according to Maloney.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman-designate of the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Monday that the
main goal of the council will be ensuring the "health, efficiency and
sustainable growth" of Taiwan's agricultural production after he assumes office.</P>
      <P>Chen Wu-hsiung made the remarks to CNA in an interview after it was confirmed
earlier Monday that he will be the new COA chairman of the incoming
administration led by President-elect Ma Ying-jeou. Ma will be sworn in on May
20.</P>
      <P>Chen, 64, earned a doctoral degree in agricultural economics from Illinois
University and once served as the council's vice chairman until January 2002. He
is currently a committee member of the National Policy Foundation -- a non-
profit think tank.</P>
      <P>As a veteran expert in Taiwan's agricultural sector, Chen also was the
mastermind who crafted Ma's agricultural policy white paper prior to the
presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>Chen said that under his leadership, the COA will aim to "build public health,
boost agricultural competitiveness  and enhance sustainable growth" as a means
of injecting a new lease on life for Taiwan's agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>Increasing Taiwan's food output in view of a deteriorating food shortage around
the globe will be his short-term objective, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Some 220,000 hectares of farmland that has been lying fallow across Taiwan
should be restored to planting crops that the country currently imports from
other countries, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Boosting the quality of Taiwan's farm products is another major goal of the COA,
according to Chen. Taiwan's farm products must be good enough and free from
pesticides and other toxic substances to fully protect consumers' health, he
said. Only such good produce can break into the international market and help
build up Taiwanese brands of farm goods, he said.</P>
      <P>To increase competitiveness, Taiwan's agricultural sector also must possess
unique technology, such as biotech, management and production expertise, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Turning to the major task of "sustainable growth, " Chen said, the government
must iron out visionary policies to preserve its natural resources, and that
every member of the public has to do his or her share to help reduce the
emission of greenhouse gas.</P>
      <P>Chen pledged to implement an 80,000-hectare forestation program in the coming
eight years and build three large world-class forest recreational parks.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the COA will help Taiwan's farmers sell their goods to
China and set up a long-term mutually beneficial cooperation system with China.
The vast Chinese market is a good outlet for Taiwan's farm products, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Along the lines of what Chen is promoting, Huang You-tsai, director of the COA's
Agriculture and Food Agency, said last week that the government would consider
resuming cultivation of fallow rice paddies to curb an increased food shortage
around the world.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the government could allow rice paddies that have lain
fallow to be plowed at any time, although it has adjusted its rice production
policy after Taiwan entered the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Compared to other Asian countries, Taiwan's rice prices remain relatively
stable, having increased by only 13 percent this year, Huang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA lifts alarm over alleged tainted milk</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 21 (CNA)
04/21/08  20:03:02
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Milk reported to have been contaminated by the milk of diseased cows has passed
drug residue tests, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Ing-haur, director of the COA's Department of Animal Industry, said health
and agricultural authorities collected samples of the raw and processed milk in
question for tests and the results "were either negative or showed no drug
residue."</P>
      <P>The allegedly tainted milk was sold under two fresh milk brands -- Highland and
Chiang Chun -- that are both marketed by leading food manufacturer, AGV Products
Corp. The milk was processed by an AGV-contracted dairy processing plant in
Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>According to a report published April 16 by Apple Daily, one of the plant's
suppliers in Yunlin County supplied it with milk from diseased cows that was
purchased at low prices from neighboring dairy farms.</P>
      <P>Because the milk was produced by cows during and immediately after a period when
they were receiving medication, by law it could not be processed for human
consumption.</P>
      <P>The revelation prompted AGV to recall the two brands of milk, and led health and
agricultural authorities to launch an investigation into the situation.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the drug test screened for antibiotics, such as tetracycline,
penicillin, sulfonamides and chloramphenicol, but found no traces of any of
them.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the situation described in the Apple Daily report, in fact,
was quite unlikely to have happened because according to council guidelines for
dairy processors' procurement of raw milk, any milk found to have drug residues
after arriving at their plants should be dyed and rejected.</P>
      <P>Of the more than 40,000 raw milk samples tested by the COA last year, 99.74
percent passed the tests, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Despite the false alarm, the COA said it will step up random checks to ensure
dairy farmers rigorously follow proper procedures in medicating their animals.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the agency insisted domestic fresh milk and dairy products were
"safe," and urged local residents to consume them freely.</P>
      <P>Although health and agricultural authorities cleared Chiang Chun's name, its
plant in Miaoli said Monday that the credibility of both Chiang Chun and AGV
Products had been "irreparably damaged."</P>
      <P>Chiang Chun said the market for all dairy products on the island were hit hard

    <HEADLINE>Taichung Mayor to promote Taichung City tourism in Hong Kong</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 21 (CNA)
04/21/08  21:13:48
(By Ruth Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu will head for Hong Kong Wednesday to promote
tourism in the central city at a seminar for travel agents of the former British
colony.</P>
      <P>Hu and Taiwan's Landis Hotel and Resorts President Stanley Yen will exchange
views on tourism promotion in Taichung and Hong Kong and issues related to
future direct charter flights between Taiwan and China at the April 25 seminar,
the Taichung mayor told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Regular direct charter flights between Taiwan and China, a key plank in
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's program, are expected to begin sometime this
year, and Hu is worried about the impact they could have on Taichung Airport.</P>
      <P>He told CNA that opening charter flights at other airports in Taiwan could hurt
existing charters between Taichung and Hong Kong and Macau, but suggested the
drops in passenger load factors could be offset by offering arrival visas to
Hong Kong and Macau residents.</P>
      <P>Hu said he had made the suggestion to the central government many times  but had
yet  to receive  any concrete  response,  but Ma may even take the Taichung
mayor's idea one step further.</P>
      <P>In a news conference with Hong Kong reporters on April 14, Ma said he would
consider granting Hong Kong visitors to Taiwan visa-free status, which some
travel agents estimated would boost arrivals from the "special administrative
region" by 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Following the seminar in Hong Kong, Hu will head to Britain to solicit
investment  and then visit the International  Baseball Federation in Switzerland
in a bid to persuade baseball's world governing body to hold more international
baseball events in his city.</P>
      <P>The Taichung mayor will also visit the International Olympic Committee in
Lausanne to lobby the organization to reinstate baseball as an Olympic event.</P>
      <P>At an IOC meeting in 2005, baseball was voted out of the Olympics beginning with
the 2012 London Games. Eight teams, including Taiwan, have qualified to play in
what might be the sport's farewall appearance at the Olympics in Beijing in
August.</P>
      <P>Eager to bring the sport's standard in Taichung to international levels, Hu
built the 15,000-seat Intercontinental Baseball Stadium to have an acceptable
venue  in the city to host international tournaments.</P>
      <P>Since its completion in 2007, the stadium has hosted the Asian Baseball
Championship, the Baseball World Cup, and the 2008 Final Olympic Qualifying
Tournament.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Foreign minister-designate hopes for truce in diplomatic tug-of-war</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister-designate Francisco Ou expressed the hope Monday of a
"truce" in the diplomatic tug-of-war between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Ou, a seasoned diplomat who is currently the Republic of China (Taiwan) 's
ambassador to Guatemala, made the remarks at a news conference held at the
headquarters of the soon-to-be-ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Ou dismissed  reports that Taiwan is engaging  in "dollar diplomacy" as
"improper, " saying that all developed countries will assist developing
countries, and that Taiwan, as a developed country, is simply doing the same
thing.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Taiwan has developed close and friendly relations with its allies over
a long period of time, and the allies have continued to speak up for Taiwan in
the international community, so it was "only  natural  for both sides  to
continue  cooperation  and reciprocity," the 68-year-old diplomat said.</P>
      <P>But he also acknowledged that some allies had done their best to exploit the
rivalry between the two sides for their own gains.</P>
      <P>"This is why a truce in diplomatic tug-of-war is important, " Ou said,
explaining that if both sides could reach an agreement on a truce, it would
benefit the two sides immensely.</P>
      <P>"The question now is to find an approach that can be accepted by both sides, "
Ou said.</P>
      <P>If Taipei and Beijing could cease their vicious competition, they could then
engage in rational cross-strait cooperation and avoid "irrational acts" to
undermine each other and squander valuable resources, he contended.</P>
      <P>Ou, a senior diplomat with 44 years of experience who said he was caught off
guard at being recruited for the post, said Taiwan's plight in the international
community is different from that of most other countries, and that diplomacy
cannot be conducted in a conventional way.</P>
      <P>Noting that diplomacy is an extension of a nation's domestic affairs, he said
that he has to learn more about the path of the new administration before he can
map out a new diplomatic approach.</P>
      <P>But he also said that "dignity" and "pragmatism" will remain key diplomatic
principles necessary to safeguard national interests.</P>
      <P>The choice of Ou is a departure from the tradition of selecting foreign
ministers from among diplomats stationed in English-speaking countries.</P>
      <P>Ou, who served as Spanish interpreter for the late President Chiang Kai-shek,
will be the first diplomat serving in a Spanish-speaking country to fill the
post.</P>
      <P>Twelve of 23 of the country's allies are located in Central and South America
and in the Caribbean.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Citibank Taiwan has lowered its forecast for Taiwan's gross domestic product
growth for 2008 to 4.0 percent, lagging even further behind the 5.7 percent
growth recorded in 2007.</P>
      <P>Cheng Cheng-mount, chief economist of Citibank Taiwan, said the growth forecast
was scaled down from 4.5 percent predicted earlier this year to 4.0 percent
mainly because of the impact of the subprime mortgage financial crisis in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Cheng said both private sector consumption and capital investment in Taiwan are
showing stronger growth momentum than last year, but export growth is expected
to slow.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also expected to maintain its unemployment rate at 3.9 percent in
2008, with the inflation rising from 1.8 in 2007 to 2.3 percent this year,
according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>The economist remained pessimistic about the performance of the U.S. economy.</P>
      <P>"The worst of the subprime mortgage crisis may be over, but the best times have
not yet arrived," he said, adding that the impact of the crisis might be felt
for another six months to one year.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng's analysis, the U.S. economy is expected to post negative
growth of minus 1.32 percent in the second quarter this year, followed by a 0.1
percent growth in the third quarter, with overall economic growth for 2008
forecast at 0.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Citibank Taiwan has forecast 1.3 percent economic growth for the euro area in
2008, 1.7 percent growth for Japan, 9.8 percent growth for China and 7.7 percent
growth for India.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More women than men vote in presidential polls: CEC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 210,000 more eligible female voters cast ballots  than their male
counterparts  in the March  22 presidential polls, Taiwan's election authority
said Monday.</P>
      <P>This year marked the first time that the Central Election Commission (CEC) had
ever conducted a gender analysis of elections in Taiwan, making it impossible to
know if the results deviated from past practice.</P>
      <P>The CEC, which said the analysis was done at the request of the Cabinet-level
Commission on Women's Rights Promotion, analyzed data for both the presidential
election and the Jan. 12 legislative polls.</P>
      <P>In the presidential election, 6.71 million of the 8.65 million eligible female
voters, or 77.65 percent, turned out to vote, while 6.5 million of the 8.67
million male voters, or 75.02 percent, exercised their rights, according to a
CEC statement released Monday.</P>
      <P>Female voter turnout surpassed male voter turnout in all but one of Taiwan's 25
cities and counties, with Taoyuan County the only exception. There, male turnout
was 78.75 percent compared to 76.41 percent turnout for female voters.</P>
      <P>Although no data exist on gender breakdowns for past elections, CEC officials
said that it is generally agreed that a higher percentage of male voters than
female voters have taken part in previous polls.</P>
      <P>That was still the case for the 2008 legislative elections, in which 5.06
million of the 8.65 million eligible male voters, or 58.5 percent, cast ballots,
edging out the 5.01 million of the 8.63 million eligible female voters, or 58.09
percent, who voted.</P>
      <P>Liao Da-chi, a political scientist with National Chungshan University, was
quoted by the Chinese-language United Daily News as having said that the higher
turnout of female voters in the presidential race should not be attributed to
the personal charisma of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who is seen as popular
among female voters.</P>
      <P>Rather, Liao said that more women turned out to vote because they attached
greater importance than men to rebuilding ethics and values in the government.</P>
      <P>Ma, who campaigned on a platform of rooting out corruption at the central
government level, defeated his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) rival Frank
Hsieh by more than 2.2 million votes.</P>
      <P>Liao also argued that female voters were more willing to take part in the
presidential election than in the legislative polls because the latter is
smaller-scale and did not create enough energy and excitement to draw women
voters to the polls.</P>
      <P>The overall turnout rates for the presidential and legislative polls were 76.33
percent and 58.28 percent, respectively.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of nine Chinese real estate developers arrived in Taiwan Monday for a
four-day visit which they described as a trip to explore the local property
market and study Taiwan's laws and experiences in real estate marketing and
development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's real estate market has the most potential of any in the Asia-Pacific
region, said delegation leader Lin Changle, the chairman of the Hong Kong-based
Phoenix Satellite Television Co., upon the group's arrival at the Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  "mature"  experience  in property management  and regulatory framework
are worth learning, added the businessman, who also operates the Beijing-based
Zhong Chen Le Tian Real Estate Development Co. Ltd.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently allows investment by Chinese nationals in the local property
market, but the barriers, including security checks, proof of the source of
funding, and strict limits on borrowing, have discouraged potential investors.</P>
      <P>As a result, fewer than a handful of Chinese have successfully bought property
here, but that may change under President-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who pledged to
open up investment in the local real estate market to Chinese developers.</P>
      <P>Asked whether their trip was connected to Ma's election victory, Liu said he
thinks now is an opportune moment for the two sides to begin implementing their
long-discussed plans to boost bilateral economic and trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>Members of the Chinese group include Lin Silian, chairman of Guangzhou R&amp;F
Properties Co., and SOHO China Ltd. Chairman Pan Shiyi.</P>
      <P>From the airport, the group of business tycoons went directly to the Neihu
Science Park in Taipei's Dazhi District to begin their tour of the island. At
the park, they received a briefing by Taipei Deputy Mayor Lin Chung-yi on
Taipei's political and economic development.</P>
      <P>The group will head to the central Taiwan city of Taichung Tuesday, where they
will be received by Mayor Jason Hu, according to the Taichung city government.</P>

      <P>Two armed robbers escaped with NT$4.3 (US$141,870) million on a motorcycle
Monday after firing 10 shots and injuring two security guards in a daylight
cash-in-transit heist in front of a post office in Taipei's Wanhua district.</P>
      <P>The two security guards were walking toward their cash-in-transit delivery
vehicle with a bag of cash collected from the post office on Guoxing Road when
fired upon by the two robbers.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-ling, director of the Wanhua Police Precinct, said the robbery was
well-planned, with the two criminals wearing raincoats, motorcycle helmets and
face masks during the attack.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, one of the security guards, surnamed Chou, was hit four times
and received penetrating wounds in both legs and his pelvis. Doctors at the
Hoping branch of the Taipei Municipal Hospital said he was not out of danger yet
and still remained in an intensive care unit.</P>
      <P>The other security guard, surnamed Hsieh, suffered two gunshot wounds on his
right knee. He was also operated on at the same hospital.</P>
      <P>Wang said police has found the silver-colored motorcycle and the empty money bag
discarded by the two robbers on a road near a river bank, and that a task force
consisting of police officers from his precinct, the Taipei Police Bureau and
the Criminal Investigation Bureau has been formed to investigate the case.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The architect  of the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) stunning run of election
victories in recent years was given a new challenge Monday when appointed as
interior minister-designate, a post in which the new government hopes he will
have a similar run of success.</P>
      <P>Liao Fung-te, the KMT's deputy secretary-general and organization and
development committee director, has been the party's election coordinator since
late 2004.</P>
      <P>Under Liao's direction, the KMT won 81 of the 113 seats in a scaled-down
Legislative Yuan in elections in January and then scored a decisive victory in
the presidential election in March.</P>
      <P>The KMT's string of electoral success under Liao began with the legislative
elections in December 2004, when the KMT-led alliance with the People  First
Party  upset the predictions  of most prognosticators by retaining its majority
in the lawmaking body.</P>
      <P>The unexpected success led President Chen Shui-bian to step down as chairman of
the party.</P>
      <P>The KMT then won the 2005 city and county head elections and by-elections,
further expanding its political dominance, and in late 2006 gained victories in
the Taipei City mayoral election and Taipei City and Kaohsiung City council
elections.</P>
      <P>The only electoral setback suffered by the party in recent years was when it
narrowly lost the race for Kaohsiung City mayor that same year.</P>
      <P>Liao's political career began when he served as election campaign spokesman for
former President Lee Tung-hui in 1996. He then failed in his bid to become Yilan
County magistrate in 1997 and was named a KMT legislator-at-large.</P>
      <P>Before starting his political career, the 57-year-old Liao, who has a doctoral
degree in history, was a newspaper reporter and accomplished writer who won a
major literary award. One of his novels, titled "Neighbors, " was adapted into a
popular television soap opera series.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Feisty female lawyer to head Ministry of Justice</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 21 (CNA)
04/21/08  23:43:28
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An articulate and feisty female lawyer who has been active in helping
disadvantaged women secure their rights was named minister of justice of the
incoming administration of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-feng, 56, said she accepted the job offer with both trepidation and a
sense of awe as she has never before been involved in prosecutorial work.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former member of the Control Yuan, responsible for monitoring the
behavior of government officials and civil servants, said both Ma and Premier-
designate  Liu Chao-shiuan had twice approached her to agree to take the helm at
the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>"I agreed to take up the job only after giving it a lot of thought, " Wang said,
adding that she is determined to do her best to live up to public expectations.</P>
      <P>On her policy vision and future work agenda, Wang said she intends to upgrade
prosecutorial efficiency, wipe out official corruption,  establish  clean
politics and further improve the protection of human rights.</P>
      <P>The appointment of Wang marked a deviation from the tradition of picking a
justice minister from the ranks of prosecutors. Asked whether her "outsider"
status would draw a backlash from prosecutors, Wang said she is confident of
addressing such issues as she has always dealt with people courteously and
sincerely.</P>
      <P>An outspoken advocate of clean politics, Wang said that after she takes office
May 20, she will push for the establishment of a special commission in each city
and county around the country to promote good governance and fight official
corruption.</P>
      <P>Wang has built a thriving legal career since obtaining a master's degree from
National Cheng Chi University's Graduate Institute of Law.</P>
      <P>In 1987, she founded the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, which is dedicated to
rescuing child prostitutes and helping women who are victims of domestic
violence. The foundation has also spoken out for aging Taiwanese women, known as
"comfort women," who were forced into providing sex services for Japanese troops
during Wolrd War II.</P>
      <P>Wang gained national attention in 1996 when she agreed to serve as then-Control
Yuan President Chen Li-an's running mate in the country's first-ever direct
presidential election. Their ticket finished last among four candidates.</P>
      <P>Following the 2004 presidential election, Wang was named by the opposition-
controlled Legislative Yuan to serve as convener of the "319 Truth Commission"
to investigate an election-eve shooting case in which President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu were slightly wounded on the campaign trail in the
southern city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue" alliance of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) claimed that the incident was staged to help the Chen-Lu ticket win
sympathy votes in the presidential poll.</P>
      <P>The incumbent president and vice president won re-election the following day,
beating the ticket comprising then-KMT Chairman Lien Chan and then-PFP Chairman
James Soong by a slim margin.</P>
      <P>Wang's appointment has drawn mixed reaction in judicial and political circles.
The country's two major prosecutor associations recognized Wang's clean image
and professionalism.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-chi, president of the Prosecutors Association, said all association
members welcomed Wang's appointment as the new justice minister.</P>
      <P>Noting that local media and members of the public have voiced high expectations
for prosecutorial reforms over the past few years, Chen said her colleagues are
hopeful that prosecutorial reforms can be accelerated following Wang's
assumption of the office.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-ming, convener of the Prosecutors Reform Association, said Wang's lack
of experience in prosecutorial work is not expected to greatly hinder her new
role so long as she can strengthen dialogue and communications with rank-and-
file prosecutors.</P>
      <P>"Wang's 'outsider status' will give her a freer hand to promote reform, but the
disadvantage lies in her unfamiliarity with the ministry's day-to-day
operations. She needs appropriate assistance," Chen Chih-ming said.</P>
      <P>Reaction from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was more reserved.
Yeh Yi-jin, a DPP legislative whip, said that during Wang's stint as spokeswoman
for the "319 Truth Commission, " Wang denied investigative  results of all law
enforcement officers, including policemen, Investigative Bureau agents and
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>"Wang should endeavor to repair the damage caused by her attitude (in pursuing
the case) after assuming her new post, " said Yeh, who also hoped that Wang
would not be obsessed with investigating the March 19, 2004 shooting case and
should follow proper procedure if she does further pursue the investigation.</P>

Cabral discovers Brazil and claims it for Portugal.

1724: Immanuel Kant, German idealist philosopher and one of history's greatest

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 210,000 more eligible female voters cast ballots  than their male
counterparts  in the March  22 presidential polls, Taiwan's election authority
said Monday.</P>
      <P>This year marked the first time that the Central Election Commission (CEC) had
ever conducted a gender analysis of elections in Taiwan, making it impossible to
know if the results deviated from past practice.</P>
      <P>The CEC, which said the analysis was done at the request of the Cabinet-level
Commission on Women's Rights Promotion, analyzed data for both the presidential
election and the Jan. 12 legislative polls.</P>
      <P>In the presidential election, 6.71 million of the 8.65 million eligible female
voters, or 77.65 percent, turned out to vote, while 6.5 million of the 8.67
million male voters, or 75.02 percent, exercised their rights, according to a
CEC statement released Monday.</P>
      <P>Female voter turnout surpassed male voter turnout in all but one of Taiwan's 25
cities and counties, with Taoyuan County the only exception. There, male turnout
was 78.75 percent compared to 76.41 percent turnout for female voters.</P>
      <P>Although no data exist on gender breakdowns for past elections, CEC officials
said that it is generally agreed that a higher percentage of male voters than
female voters have taken part in previous polls.</P>
      <P>That was still the case for the 2008 legislative elections, in which 5.06
million of the 8.65 million eligible male voters, or 58.5 percent, cast ballots,
edging out the 5.01 million of the 8.63 million eligible female voters, or 58.09
percent, who voted.</P>
      <P>Liao Da-chi, a political scientist with National Chungshan University, was
quoted by the Chinese-language United Daily News as having said that the higher
turnout of female voters in the presidential race should not be attributed to
the personal charisma of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who is seen as popular
among female voters.</P>
      <P>Rather, Liao said that more women turned out to vote because they attached
greater importance than men to rebuilding ethics and values in the government.</P>
      <P>Ma, who campaigned on a platform of rooting out corruption at the central
government level, defeated his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) rival Frank
Hsieh by more than 2.2 million votes.</P>
      <P>Liao also argued that female voters were more willing to take part in the
presidential election than in the legislative polls because the latter is
smaller-scale and did not create enough energy and excitement to draw women
voters to the polls.</P>
      <P>The overall turnout rates for the presidential and legislative polls were 76.33
percent and 58.28 percent, respectively.</P>

      <P>Two armed robbers escaped with NT$4.3 (US$141,870) million on a motorcycle
Monday after firing 10 shots and injuring two security guards in a daylight
cash-in-transit heist in front of a post office in Taipei's Wanhua district.</P>
      <P>The two security guards were walking toward their cash-in-transit delivery
vehicle with a bag of cash collected from the post office on Guoxing Road when
fired upon by the two robbers.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-ling, director of the Wanhua Police Precinct, said the robbery was
well-planned, with the two criminals wearing raincoats, motorcycle helmets and
face masks during the attack.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, one of the security guards, surnamed Chou, was hit four times
and received penetrating wounds in both legs and his pelvis. Doctors at the
Hoping branch of the Taipei Municipal Hospital said he was not out of danger yet
and still remained in an intensive care unit.</P>
      <P>The other security guard, surnamed Hsieh, suffered two gunshot wounds on his
right knee. He was also operated on at the same hospital.</P>
      <P>Wang said police has found the silver-colored motorcycle and the empty money bag

    <TEXT>
      <P>The architect  of the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) stunning run of election
victories in recent years was given a new challenge Monday when appointed as
interior minister-designate, a post in which the new government hopes he will
have a similar run of success.</P>
      <P>Liao Fung-te, the KMT's deputy secretary-general and organization and
development committee director, has been the party's election coordinator since
late 2004.</P>
      <P>Under Liao's direction, the KMT won 81 of the 113 seats in a scaled-down
Legislative Yuan in elections in January and then scored a decisive victory in
the presidential election in March.</P>
      <P>The KMT's string of electoral success under Liao began with the legislative
elections in December 2004, when the KMT-led alliance with the People  First
Party  upset the predictions  of most prognosticators by retaining its majority
in the lawmaking body.</P>
      <P>The unexpected success led President Chen Shui-bian to step down as chairman of
the party.</P>
      <P>The KMT then won the 2005 city and county head elections and by-elections,
further expanding its political dominance, and in late 2006 gained victories in
the Taipei City mayoral election and Taipei City and Kaohsiung City council
elections.</P>
      <P>The only electoral setback suffered by the party in recent years was when it
narrowly lost the race for Kaohsiung City mayor that same year.</P>
      <P>Liao's political career began when he served as election campaign spokesman for
former President Lee Tung-hui in 1996. He then failed in his bid to become Yilan
County magistrate in 1997 and was named a KMT legislator-at-large.</P>
      <P>Before starting his political career, the 57-year-old Liao, who has a doctoral
degree in history, was a newspaper reporter and accomplished writer who won a
major literary award. One of his novels, titled "Neighbors, " was adapted into a
popular television soap opera series.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An articulate and feisty female lawyer who has been active in helping
disadvantaged women secure their rights was named minister of justice of the
incoming administration of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-feng, 56, said she accepted the job offer with both trepidation and a
sense of awe as she has never before been involved in prosecutorial work.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former member of the Control Yuan, responsible for monitoring the
behavior of government officials and civil servants, said both Ma and Premier-
designate  Liu Chao-shiuan had twice approached her to agree to take the helm at
the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>"I agreed to take up the job only after giving it a lot of thought, " Wang said,
adding that she is determined to do her best to live up to public expectations.</P>
      <P>On her policy vision and future work agenda, Wang said she intends to upgrade
prosecutorial efficiency, wipe out official corruption,  establish  clean
politics and further improve the protection of human rights.</P>
      <P>Wang also expressed her hope that the MOJ becomes a "ministry of the people" and
prosecutors under its jurisdiction become "servants of justice."</P>
      <P>The appointment of Wang marked a deviation from the tradition of picking a
justice minister from the ranks of prosecutors. Asked whether her "outsider"
status would draw a backlash from prosecutors, Wang said she is confident of
addressing such issues as she has always dealt with people courteously and
sincerely.</P>
      <P>An outspoken advocate of clean politics, Wang said that after she takes office
May 20, she will push for the establishment of a special commission in each city
and county around the country to promote good governance and fight official
corruption.</P>
      <P>Wang has built a thriving legal career since obtaining a master's degree from
National Cheng Chi University's Graduate Institute of Law.</P>
      <P>In 1987, she founded the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, which is dedicated to
rescuing child prostitutes and helping women who are victims of domestic
violence. The foundation has also spoken out for aging Taiwanese women, known as
"comfort women," who were forced into providing sex services for Japanese troops
during Wolrd War II.</P>
      <P>Wang gained national attention in 1996 when she agreed to serve as then-Control
Yuan President Chen Li-an's running mate in the country's first-ever direct
presidential election. Their ticket finished last among four candidates.</P>
      <P>Following the 2004 presidential election, Wang was named by the opposition-
controlled Legislative Yuan to serve as convener of the "319 Truth Commission"
to investigate an election-eve shooting case in which President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu were slightly wounded on the campaign trail in the
southern city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue" alliance of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) claimed that the incident was staged to help the Chen-Lu ticket win
sympathy votes in the presidential poll.</P>
      <P>The incumbent president and vice president won re-election the following day,
beating the ticket comprising then-KMT Chairman Lien Chan and then-PFP Chairman
James Soong by a slim margin.</P>
      <P>Wang's appointment has drawn mixed reaction in judicial and political circles.
The country's two major prosecutor associations recognized Wang's integrity,
no-nonsense  working attitude and professionalism.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-chi, president of the Prosecutors Association, said all association
members welcomed Wang's appointment as the new justice minister.</P>
      <P>Noting that local media and members of the public have voiced high expectations
for prosecutorial reforms over the past few years, Chen said her colleagues are
hopeful that prosecutorial reforms can be accelerated following Wang's
assumption of the office.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-ming, convener of the Prosecutors Reform Association, said Wang's lack
of experience in prosecutorial work is not expected to greatly hinder her new
role so long as she can strengthen dialogue and communications with rank-and-
file prosecutors.</P>
      <P>"Wang's 'outsider status' will give her a freer hand to promote reform, but the
disadvantage lies in her unfamiliarity with the ministry's day-to-day
operations. She needs appropriate assistance," Chen Chih-ming said.</P>
      <P>Reaction from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was more reserved.
Yeh Yi-jin, a DPP legislative whip, said that during Wang's stint as spokeswoman
for the "319 Truth Commission, " Wang denied investigative  results of all law
enforcement officers, including policemen, Investigative Bureau agents and
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>"Wang should endeavor to repair the damage caused by her attitude (in pursuing
the case) after assuming her new post, " said Yeh, who also hoped that Wang
would not be obsessed with investigating the March 19, 2004 shooting case and
should follow proper procedure if she does further pursue the investigation.</P>

      <P>The Consumers' Foundation recommended Tuesday that food containing artificial
colorings and preservatives be labeled with warnings of their possible harmful
effects, after a British study found a link between the consumption of certain
food colorings and hyperactive behavior in children.</P>
      <P>The study investigated the effect of six food colorings -- sunset yellow,
quinoline yellow, carmoisine, allura red, tartrazine and ponceau -- and the
presevative sodium benzoate on 153 3-year-old and 144 8- and 9-year-olds drawn
from the general population.</P>
      <P>The researchers from the University of Southampton who conducted the study
concluded in results published in September 2007 that the additives increased
hyperactive behavior in the children tested.</P>
      <P>The findings prompted the European Food Standards Agency to recommend earlier
this month that the six colorings be phased out from food and beverages in the
European Union.</P>
      <P>According to Consumers' Foundation Chairman Cheng Jen-hung, a survey conducted
by the foundation March 20-24 on 21 brands of ice pops and preserved fruits sold
in Taiwan found that they all contained sodium benzoate and either tartrazine,
sunset yellow or allura red.</P>
      <P>Given the common use of the additives in food manufacturing, consumers should be
warned of their possible harmful effects on their children, especially those
already diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Cheng
said.</P>
      <P>The Naivety ADHD Education Foundation has estimated that there are more than
137,000 elementary and junior high school students in Taiwan with the disorder.</P>

      <P>The IDU Executive  Committee,  meeting  in Sydney with 50 participants from 27
countries, unanimously approved the statement drafted by the IDU Secretariat to
congratulate the Kuomintang's (KMT's) Ma on his victory in the March 22

      <P>Describing the election as the second peaceful and democratic transition of
power in Taiwan, the statement was hopeful that it would serve as an example for
the Asia-Pacific region as a whole.</P>
      <P>"The KMT victory is a positive for the stability of the Asia-Pacific region, and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Following U.S. authorities' recent recall of children's fake teeth and push toys
imported from China, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)  has launched a
six-month inspection campaign to check if any of the recalled products are being
sold in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S.  Consumer Product Safety Commission announced two separate voluntary
recalls on April 10 and April 16 of 26,000 packs of fake teeth and 9,000 push
toys imported by two American retailers, FUNTASTIC, and Santa Toy Corp.,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The commission found that the surface paint on the products contained excessive
levels of lead, violating the U.S. federal lead paint standard.</P>
      <P>The "Hillbilly teeth" feature teeth painted yellow unevenly spaced across brown-
painted gums.</P>
      <P>The push toy is a plastic horse with a rider and a 20-inch long pole/handle. The
rider is wearing red pants and a green shirt, while the horse comes in various
colors.</P>
      <P>While there have been no reports to date of illness among children playing with
these toys, the commission urged U.S. consumers to immediately take these toys
away from children and return them to retailers for a refund.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection under the MOEA said it had no
knowledge of any of the recalled products being imported into Taiwan but said it
has launched a series of measures, including a six-month import inspection and
monitoring program that began April 17, to ensure Taiwan is free from these
potentially threatening products.</P>
      <P>"If the same products were found in local market, the bureau will inspect  them
to determine  if they violate local lead paint standards," an bureau official
said.</P>
      <P>To help track down the toys, the bureau issued a description of the suspected
goods and encouraged local consumers to report to the bureau if they have
purchased the toys, according to a MOEA press release.</P>
      <P>Locally sold toys have long been subject to inspections for safety reasons and
are banned from the domestic market if found to be substandard, the statement
said.</P>

      <P>President-elect  Ma  Ying-jeou's announcement of imposing an energy tax was a
plank of his campaign platform and is nothing new, Ma's spokesman Lo Chih-chiang
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lo also said, however, that the substantive measures will have to be worked out
by related government agencies after Ma's inauguration May 20.</P>
      <P>Ma announced Monday that he would impose an energy tax, with the revenues being
channeled into the development of renewable energy. He also promised to promote
greater energy efficiency, and formulate measures to cut greenhouse gas
emissions, at an event held to mark Earth Day, which falls on April 22.</P>
      <P>Lo welcomed opinions on the energy tax policy from all corners of society and
said they would be taken into consideration in crafting the measure.</P>
      <P>On Economic Affairs Minister-designate Yiin Chii-ming's remarks that he will
hike gasoline prices in one step after assuming his post May 20, Lo said such an
approach was that of a responsible administration.</P>
      <P>But he also said the incoming administration will consider subsidies for low-
income and undperpriviledged groups to help them absorb the burden of higher
gasoline prices.</P>
      <P>Despite the soaring price of crude oil on world markets, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party administration has imposed a freeze on gasoline prices since
last November in a bid to keep a lid on inflationary pressures caused by rising
commodity prices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA vows to maintain diplomatic ties with Paraguay after poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that it will endeavor to
maintain diplomatic relations with Paraguay despite Sunday's election victory by
a presidential candidate known to favor establishing ties with China.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said the agency has congratulated Paraguay's newly
elected president Fernando Lugo and that there is no change to the diplomatic
relations or bilateral cooperative projects between Paraguay and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop, won a historic victory in Paraguay's
presidential election, ending more than six decades of rule by the center-right
Colorado Party.</P>
      <P>Dubbed the "bishop of the poor, " the 56-year-old Lugo vowed to improve the
economy of the poor South American nation and clean up practices that have given
Paraguay the reputation as being a corrupt country and a safe haven for
smuggling.</P>
      <P>Lugo resigned the post of bishop in December 2006 to sidestep Paraguay's
constitutional ban on clergy seeking office.</P>
      <P>Lugo said during his campaign that he would like to establish relations with
China if elected, giving rise to speculation that Taiwan might lose its only
diplomatic ally in South America to China.</P>
      <P>"There are different opinions on Paraguay's diplomatic relations to other
countries, and, rather than being decided by the president alone, it is an issue
to be carefully discussed within the nation itself," Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Lugo, in an interview with the Central News Agency before the election,
stressed that he understands that Taiwan and Paraguay  have  a long-lasting  and
good relationship.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ambassador to Paraguay David Hu also paid a visit to Lugo before the
election and exchanged views on bilateral relations, she added.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the MOFA will maintain close contact with Lugo and make plans on
sending a delegation to his inauguration ceremony Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>It is uncertain whether or not President-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who is to take
office May 20, will attend the inauguration ceremony.</P>
      <P>Paraguay and Taiwan forged diplomatic relations in 1957.</P>

      <P>National Central University (NCU) began a series of activities Tuesday to mark
World Book and Copyright Day, launched by the United Nations Education,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to encourage reading and held
every April 23.</P>
      <P>The NCU opened an eight-day book exhibition in the lobby of its library Tuesday
to mark the day, with more than 100 books on display that focused on the concept
of life education.</P>
      <P>The university is also encouraging people to donate books for children living in
remote and poor areas, and will present a lecture by professor Daisy Hung,
founder of the university's Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, on the
"relations between the brain and reading" on May 6.</P>
      <P>The school will also hold a movie festival on its campus themed around life
education, including award-winning and popular movies such as Children of
Heaven, Marvin's Room and Good Will Hunting.</P>
      <P>Chen Su-lan, a section chief of the university's library, noted that with the
popularity of the Internet, the reading population is shrinking worldwide. But
the librarian hoped that the activities organized by the university would plant
the seeds of reading around the island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, many elementary schools around the country are also encouraging
students  to  donate  books  for  children  from underprivileged families or who
live in remote areas to encourage more young people to read.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said Tuesday that he is open to the
idea of Chinese investment in Taiwan, including in his county, but voiced
objections to any plans for Chinese investors to speculate in the housing
market.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks to reporters while answering questions related to a four-
day visit by a group of Chinese real estate moguls who arrived a day earlier in
Taiwan to study the country's investment climate and business opportunities in
the local tourism resort and real estate sectors.</P>
      <P>Yang said he has accepted an invitation from the Fokuangshan Temple to attend a
welcome party for the Chinese group, which is slated to visit the Kaohsiung
County-based temple Thursday.</P>
      <P>Reiterating that he welcomes Chinese investment in Taiwan, Yang, however, made
it clear that he is firmly opposed to any speculating in the domestic housing
market by Chinese investors.</P>
      <P>Yang is a senior member of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which
lost the March 22 presidential election to the Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who will assume the presidency on May 20, has
vowed to build closer trade and economic ties with China and to open Taiwan to
Chinese investment.</P>
      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew also has advocated establishing a cross-Taiwan
Strait common market and helping Taiwanese farmers, mostly in central and
southern regions, sell their produce to China.</P>
      <P>Yang said he is particularly  keen on attracting  Chinese investment in tourism-
related businesses, such as hotels and resort facilities which are capable of
creating more job opportunities than hi-tech businesses.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, the county could use Chinese capital for a project to build a
resort on a 240-hectare artificial land in Yungan township. The Kaohsiung County
magistrate said the Chinese group is welcome to conduct an on-the-spot
inspection.</P>
      <P>Yang said last week that the Kaohsiung County government is currently seeking
private investment to jointly develop the island into a resort, adding that
Chinese capital is also welcome.</P>
      <P>However,  he expressed concerns that some Chinese property investors might enter
the Taiwanese market merely to speculate.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan has long been a stronghold of the pro-
independence DPP. The DPP presidential ticket won more votes than the KMT's Ma-
Siew ticket in the southern Taiwan county in the March 22 presidential election,
despite the KMT's big gains in most of the other constituencies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chinese real estate developer group attended an investment
seminar hosted Tuesday by Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lun after touring
Cihu -- the site of late President Chiang Kai-shek's tomb in the county in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Clarifying rampant allegations that the group's visit might drive up Taiwan's
private house prices, Liu Changle, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Phoenix
Satellite Television Co. who led the delegation, said that the aim of the
group's visit is to explore Taiwan's urban development.</P>
      <P>"The group has set its sights on tourism-related facilities in Taiwan,  rather
than on general residential properties, " Liu explained.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held earlier the same day at the Legislative Yuan, members
of the DPP's legislative caucus warned that an influx of Chinese capital into
Taiwan's housing market might further diverge Taiwan's economic development into
an increasingly M-shaped society.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Wong Chin-chu called it a futile attempt to pin the hopes of
boosting Taiwan's urban development on Chinese real estate businessmen.</P>
      <P>"Such an approach only would benefit construction companies and would put
Taiwan's people at a great disadvantage," she said.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Pan Meng-an cautioned the incoming KMT government against
deteriorating public order if Taiwan is opened to Chinese tourists rashly
without the introduction of complementary measures.</P>

      <P>As Taiwan marks Earth Day Tuesday with a variety of activities to conserve
energy and cut greenhouse gas emission, National Kaohsiung Normal University
took an unusual approach -- the school's faculty skipped one meal.</P>
      <P>University President Tai Chia-nan, and school professors and students converged
in front of the student activity center shortly before noon. Dressed in blue to
mark Earth Day, they declared that they would skip lunch.</P>
      <P>School faculty noted that cutting a meal will allow the human body the
opportunity to digest properly and recover.</P>
      <P>Greenhouse gas emitted during the stages of food planting, raising,
transportation, storage, manufacturing as well as distribution will also be cut
as a result of people eating one fewer meal, faculty members said.</P>
      <P>According to a study by the school, preparing a lunchbox in Taiwan results in
the emission of half a kilogram of carbon dioxide. If 200 members of the faculty
skip lunch, it will help save 100 kg of dioxide emission.</P>
      <P>Tai also urged the faculty to encourage others to join the "cut meal, cut noise
and cut carbon dioxide emission" campaign.</P>
      <P>The school stressed that "noise cut" will also allow people to live in a quiet
and tranquil environment, which it said will not only help conserve electricity,
but will allow the public to learn the benefits of living a simple and quiet
life.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan staged an islandwide campaign Tuesday to reduce carbon emissions, in an
Earth Day event led by president-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who pledged to introduce a
policy to save energy and reduce carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>Ma said on Monday that when he takes office he will enact a Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Act and impose an energy tax that would be used to fund renewable
energy research.</P>
      <P>EPA Minister-designate Shen Shih-hung said Tuesday that the proposed energy tax
is one of Ma's most important policies, and that the new administration will
implement it step by step to minimize the economic impact.</P>
      <P>In response, Winston Dang, the incumbent EPA minister, said that an energy tax
and regulations related to renewable energy can only be implemented after the
enactment of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act, which is under review in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Dang, who has less than a month left in office, has been very vocal in his
efforts to raise awareness of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He
had asked that government officials turn off office lights from noon to 1 p.m.,
to go to office on foot and eat vegetarian meals made with local ingredients, in
observance of Earth Day.</P>
      <P>"Sustainability is a simple notion -- to leave behind clean water and pure air
for future generations, " said Dang at a press conference. Small actions taken
now in daily life can be fruitful later on, he added.</P>
      <P>People in Taiwan especially should make an effort, as Taiwan, with 0.35 percent
of the world's population, produces almost 1 percent of the world's carbon
dioxide emissions, he said.</P>
      <P>In response to Dang's call, Shieh Jhy-wey, minister of the Government
Information Office (GIO), walked to work Tuesday morning, saying that he was
reminded of his school days.</P>
      <P>"We can put this one-day effort into regular practice, " said Shieh, in response
to a question on whether people can really help save the Earth by walking to
work only on Earth Day.</P>
      <P>To help make it easier for people to choose vegetarian meals on Earth Day, the
GIO cafeteria offered a mostly vegetarian menu, which was generally met with
approval by the GIO staff.</P>
      <P>"In fact, a vegetarian meal is not enough for a man -- I will be hungry soon.
But I am glad to be a part of the movement, " a GIO official said.</P>
      <P>Several workshops were also held all day Tuesday under the theme, "The first
year of the carbon reduction era."</P>

      <P>Amid speculation that talks to ink a free trade agreement (FTA) between Taiwan
and Singapore might restart soon, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Tuesday refused to comment on whether there is any progress in resuming
negotiations on this sensitive issue.</P>
      <P>When asked to comment on reports that Singapore and Taiwan will reopen
discussions of an FTA soon, Weber Shih, director-general of the MOFA's
Department of Economic and Trade Affairs told a regular press briefing that to
strengthen co-operations, especially in the economic realm, with member
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has always been
one of the main tasks of the government.</P>
      <P>"The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is of course among our major tasks. However, we
cannot give details on any particular case, " Shih said.</P>
      <P>Reports said prospects seemed to have brightened that the Southeast Asian city-
state might be more willing to negotiate with Taiwan on a free trade deal after
the Kuomintang, which favors closer trade ties with China and easing cross-
strait tensions, won a decisive victory in the March 22 presidential election in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his meeting with international media after his election victory, President-
elect Ma Ying-jeou said he would push to revive talks for an FTA with Singapore,
based on the "WTO formula, " meaning using Taiwan's name in the World Trade
Organization - "Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu".</P>
      <P>This name was used by the island to join the World Trade Organization in 2002,
as China, which considers Taiwan part of its territory, objects to Taiwan
joining international organizations as a nation.</P>
      <P>Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement recently that "FTAs
with customs territories such as Taiwan are permissible under WTO rules, "
according to a report by the China Post.</P>
      <P>The city-state, however, set up preconditions to an FTA deal, such as that
issues involving trade should not be politicized.</P>
      <P>Shih said he believed that building up a full-scale economic trade partnership
with countries in the Southeast Asian region will be the priority of the
incoming government.</P>
      <P>According to an unofficial account, the free trade discussions between Taiwan
and Singapore, which started in 2000, stagnated after the outgoing President
Chen Shui-bian's government insisted on signing the FTA using the name "Taiwan"
or its official title the "Republic of China".</P>
      <P>So far, Taiwan has no FTA with any leading trade nations due to such political
obstacles.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As part of the activities to mark Earth Day Tuesday,  the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) commended five local governments for their
achievements in carbon emission reduction.</P>
      <P>The five areas named were Taipei City, Taipei County, Taoyuan County in northern
Taiwan, and Tainan City and Kaohsiung City in the south.</P>
      <P>"While  people can refuse to eat polluted  food or drink contaminated water,
they cannot refuse to breathe polluted air and cannot escape the impact of
global warming, " said EPA Minister Winston Dang at the award ceremony. He
encouraged local governments to play a more active role in protecting the health
of their residents.</P>
      <P>Taipei city was commended for its diverse efforts to reduce carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>For example, the city reduced its volume of garbage from 1,600,000 tons in 1998
to about 600,000 tons in 2006. Also, the city hall building is recycling rain
water to flush its toilets, and the city was the first local government to adopt
hybrid cars for official use, according to the EPA.</P>
      <P>Apart for the five local governments that received commendations, Miaoli County
in northern Taiwan, Tainan County in the south and Hualien County in the eastern
part of the island were also cited by the EPA as setting good examples.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lights out event saves 28,800 kwh of electricity in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 28,800 kilowatt-hours (kwh) of electricity was saved in a one-hour
lights out event held from noon Tuesday in Taiwan to mark Earth Day, officials
at the state-owned Taiwan Power Company said.</P>
      <P>The amount conserved has in effect reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 18,374
kilograms and represents a great improvement compared with the 17,500 kwh that
was saved in a similar activity held last year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The activity was mainly held among government agencies and public schools, while
the private sector was encouraged to follow suit.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tien Chiu-chin, the initiator of
the campaign, said the lights out event was intended simply as a demonstration
and that it is more important for people to make energy conservation a habit in
their daily life in order to save the Earth.</P>
      <P>According to the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs,
turning off for one hour a fluorescent lighting fixture with four 20-watt lamps,
as commonly seen in offices, can save 0.08 kwh of electricity and decrease
carbon dioxide emissions by 53 grams.</P>
      <P>As 26 percent of the total of 4.7 billion kwh of electricity consumed by
government agencies every year are used on lighting, it can save 500,000 kwh of
electricity if all these agencies have their lights turned off for one hour, the
bureau said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The amount of electricity conserved will increase to 1.88 million kwh if the
commercial sector joins the action and further to 5.09 million kwh if all
households around the country also take part, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's energy conservation efforts, the public is also
encouraged to replace traditional lighting with high-performance, energy-
efficient ones, the bureau said.</P>

      <P>Miaoli County Magistrate Liu Cheng-hung drank and gave away milk at the county
hall Tuesday to help restore consumer confidence in the products of a local
dairy plant that was accused of selling tainted milk.</P>
      <P>Liu bought 161 bottles of fresh milk and 48 boxes of sterilized milk from the
plant in the northern county one day after the Council of Agriculture (COA)
announced that the plant's products had passed drug residue tests.</P>
      <P>According to a report published April 16 by the Chinese-language Apple Daily,
one of the plant's suppliers in the southern county of Yunlin had been
purchasing milk from diseased cows at low prices from neighboring dairy farms.</P>
      <P>The allegedly tainted milk was sold under two fresh milk brands -- Highland and
General Milk -- that are both marketed by leading food manufacturer, AGV
Products Corp.</P>
      <P>The news report prompted AGV to recall the two brands of milk.</P>
      <P>Despite the release of the COA test results, the plant said, the false alarm
dealt it a huge blow because all its orders were canceled after the newspaper
report.</P>
      <P>The plant said that having received no orders, it now faces the problem of how
to pay its 110 employees.</P>
      <P>The plant also stated Monday that the credibility of both General Milk and AGV
Products had been "irreparably damaged."</P>
      <P>General Milk said the market for all dairy products on the island were hit hard
by Apple Daily's report last week, with sales falling by 30 to 40 percent.</P>
      <P>The company indicated that, along with AGV, it had borne the brunt of the
problem, losing an estimated NT$10 million (US$330,250) daily since the report
was published.</P>
      <P>General Milk said it reserved the right to file suit against the Apple Daily and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health activists launched a campaign Tuesday to promote a balanced diet for
elementary school children, encouraging the daily consumption of adequate
amounts of fruit and vegetables.</P>
      <P>The campaign was organized by the Formosa Cancer Foundation (FCF) and the
Ministry of Education (MOE) with the sponsorship of Yuanta Foundation, the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office, 13 U.S. agricultural producer
associations and the Wellcome Taiwan Company, Ltd.</P>
      <P>According to a recent survey conducted online by the FCF, 54 percent of the
5,172 respondents aged under 12 had inaccurate knowledge  about the "5-a-day"
concept of fruit and vegetable consumption, which is the theme of the campaign.</P>
      <P>Referring to the "5-a-day" idea that everyone should eat at least three portions
of vegetables and two of fruit per day, Lai Gi-ming, executive chief officer of
the FCF, said that "even though more than 50 percent of the students have heard
about `5-a-day,' there is still room for us to make more effort" to increase
awareness.</P>
      <P>Admitting at the ceremony that he himself is not particularly fond of certain
fruits and vegetables, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng who is also
chairman of the FCF, said that "through this campaign, I hope we can find
solutions that will help persuade both adults and children to eat more fruit and
vegetables."</P>
      <P>"A balanced diet not only makes school children healthier but also helps prevent
cancer," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The survey results also indicate that although 99 percent of the students polled
understand the advantages of eating sufficient fruit and vegetables, only 60
percent are in the habit of doing so.</P>
      <P>Attributing the unwillingness to eat fruit and vegetables to parents who do not
prepare enough fruit and vegetables at home, Fuh Wei-wei, a section chief at the
MOE, said that "the public, parents and teachers must pay more attention to
children's nutrition."</P>
      <P>Fuh further promised that "the MOE will suggest that elementary schools
throughout Taiwan be aware of balanced diet when preparing lunches for school
children."</P>
      <P>Commending the partnership with the FCF as a "truly win-win situation" not only
for children's health but also for the U.S. agricultural producers involved in
the project, AIT spokesman Thomas Hodges said that "a healthy diet that includes
at least five full servings of fruit and vegetables is a widely recognized and
easy-to-implement way to maintain health and prevent disease."</P>
      <P>"In 2008, the Agricultural Trade Office under the AIT and its agricultural
producer associations will provide funding to develop and print new interactive
nutrition education materials that will be distributed to over 50,000 school
children and their families around Taiwan," Hodges said.</P>
      <P>In support of the campaign, Piano Chia, group marketing manager of the Wellcome
chain, which operates some 200 supermarkets around Taiwan, also announced
special discounts for school children who purchase fruit or vegetables from its
outlets.</P>
      <P>"By offering coupons that enable children and their parents to enjoy savings on
fruit and vegetables at Wellcome, I hope everyone will take part in this
meaningful activity for better health, " Chai said.</P>

      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei said Tuesday that the county plans to open
offices in China to lure Chinese investment and that he may visit Beijing in May
or June to explore such possibilities.</P>

four-day visit by a group of nine Chinese real estate moguls who arrived in
Taipei Monday to study Taiwan's investment climate and business opportunities.</P>
      <P>The Taipei county magistrate met the Chinese visitors Monday evening.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, he is considering attending an architectural seminar in
Beijing in May or an international travel fair to be held in the Chinese capital
in June,  to gain access to Chinese entrepreneurs and exchange views with them
on investing in Taipei County and on opening offices in China.</P>
      <P>The county government has rented a big booth in Beijing's upcoming international
travel fair to try to promote the northern Taiwan county to the Chinese public
and woo potential tourists to the county.</P>
      <P>Chou did not say where in China the county will open its representative offices.</P>
      <P>Turning to the visiting group of Chinese real estate moguls, Chou said they came
to Taiwan in search of fresh investment opportunities outside  China,  where
investment  environments  have undergone noticeable changes in recent years.</P>
      <P>The group's visit has sparked a high degree of attention in Taiwan after the
Kuomintang's  Ma Ying-jeou won the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ma, who will assume the presidency on May 20, favors wider trade and economic
exchanges between Taiwan and China after eight years of the rule by the pro-
independence Democratic Progressive Party, which has been passive in exploring
business opportunities with China.</P>
      <P>Ma has promised to allow Chinese investment as well as more Chinese tourists in
Taiwan as a way to boost the island's economy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi touted the motel industry in the central
Taiwanese city Tuesday during a meeting with nine visiting Chinese real estate
developers.</P>
      <P>The high-profile group traveled from Taipei in northern Taiwan earlier  in the
day to Taichung  to continue  their four-day "fact-finding" trip in Taiwan which
began Monday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese entrepreneurs' arrival triggered attention from the local media,
with some calling them "persons of great wealth" as each of the real estate
tycoons is said to hold multibillion NT dollars in wealth, and is poised to
invest in Taiwan as soon as President-elect Ma Ying-jeou takes office on May 20.</P>
      <P>At the city hall, Hsiao told reporters that the property developers  want to
know the market for premium  motels  and high-quality residential buildings in
the city.</P>
      <P>In Taichung, Hsiao said, the motel industry is a "unique, quality emerging
business, " with many "six-star" and "seven-star" motels.</P>
      <P>"The living environment offered by those motels cast a shadow on many
international hotels, " Hsiao said, noting that the city government's office has
arranged for the Chinese guests to visit different motels to experience
different lodging services during their one-day stay in Taichung.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently allows investment by Chinese nationals in the local property
market, but the barriers, including security checks, proof of the source of
funding, and strict limits on borrowing, have discouraged potential investors.</P>
      <P>As a result, fewer than a handful of Chinese have successfully bought property
here, but that may change under Ma, who pledged to open up investment in the
local real estate market to Chinese developers as a way to boost the local
economy.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said he expects Taichung will have a bright future in economic and trade
development because after direct air links between Taiwan and China are set up,
as Ma has also pledged to do, Taichung's Chingchuankang airport is expected to
become one of the key ports of entry for Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>The visiting Chinese business tycoons, headed by Lin Changle, chairman of the
Hong Kong-based Phoenix Satellite Television Co. who also operates the Beijing-
based Zhong Chen Le Tian Real Estate Development Co. Ltd., arrived in Taiwan
Monday.</P>
      <P>Group members include Li Silian, chairman of Guangzhou-based R&amp;F Properties;
Zeng Wei, chairman of Beijing-based Palm Springs Holdings Co.; Hu Baosen,
chairman of Henan-based Jianye Group; Feng Lun, chairman of the Beijing-based

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's negative real wage growth overshadows rising labor capacity</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
04/22/08  21:49:48
(By Yeh Fang-hsun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's real wage growth from January to February recorded its worst level
since 1981, with negative growth of 1.52 percent that overshadowed the rise in
regular wages during the same period, the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In tune with the monthly unemployment rate of 3.86 percent in March -- the
lowest in eight years -- the employed population recorded 1.28 percent growth
year-on-year to reach a monthly average of 10.37 million during the first three
months of 2008, indicating a growing labor market, said Huang Jiann-jong, deputy
director of the Bureau of Census under the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate in this year's first three months marked 3.87 percent,
Huang added.</P>
      <P>The overall regular wage, which is calculated one month behind the employment
statistics, also showed steady growth, marking an eight-year high at 1.84
percent year-on-year in the first two months of 2008.</P>
      <P>But the global inflation affected the local consumer price index (CPI), causing
it to grow 3.41 percent during the same period, which undermined the real wage
growth to minus 1.52 percent, the worst level in 27 years, said Huang.</P>
      <P>"The rising pace of regular wages has been relatively slow compared to that of
consumer prices," Huang went on.</P>
      <P>He cited the low profitability of local companies and part-time employment as
the major factors of the gradual increase, a result of fiercer competition in
the increasingly globalized economy.</P>
      <P>Touching on the country's overall economy, Huang said the domestic labor market
remained healthy, as the structure of the employment market has not changed
despite the ongoing problem of an increasing unemployed population of people
with tertiary education, which jumped to 282,000 in 2007 from 89,000 in 1997.</P>
      <P>"The high salary demands of these young people has led them to accept only
either voluntary or short-term unemployment, " said Huang, noting this so-called
"frictional unemployment" affects the local economy very little.</P>
      <P>The March unemployment rate for college graduates stood at 3.88 percent, just
0.02 percent higher than the overall rate of 3.86 percent, according to the
DGBAS.</P>
      <P>"Compared with unemployment rates in other Asian countries like Japan and Hong
Kong, which stood at 3.9 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively, the rate in
Taiwan is nothing out of ordinary," he went on.</P>
      <P>Scholars are more concerned by both the slow pace of salary growth and
unemployment among college graduates, as global inflation continues to eat away
at the lukewarm economic rise.</P>
      <P>"The small wage growth indicates a slow-growing local economy, in which the
capacity and profitability of local industries are not performing at their best,
" said Lee-rong Wang, director of the Center for Economic Forecasting under the
Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research.</P>
      <P>To cope with the import inflation caused by the skyrocketing commodity prices
around the world, Wang said a prosperous local economy, or micro-economy, could
help increase the nominal wage standard  to compensate  for the effects of the
international situation.</P>
      <P>Individuals also need to play a part to boost earnings, she added,  saying  that
college  students  should  upgrade  their employability by developing skills
that are unique compared to those of their peers.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's economic outlook -- and accordingly the wage standard -- in recent
years have not been as good as those of neighboring countries, which has driven
many of our high-quality employees to seek work overseas," she added.</P>
      <P>Another way to tackle the low earnings, Wang suggested, would be to increase
wages in the government sector.</P>
      <P>"Labor history in Taiwan tells us that every time the government gets a raise,
the private sector follows, as a result of labor market competition," she said.</P>

      <P>A remote village housing 150 Atayal tribe members in the mountains of Hsinchu
County, northern Taiwan, recently started a "lighting revolution" by replacing
all the electric lamps in the village with high-performance and energy-saving
bulbs, a county official said Tuesday as the world marked Earth Day.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsien-sheng, county head of the area, related the story of the village
Smangus, known as "the Tribe of God, " during a "one-hour lights off" exercise
at the county office. The action was aimed at calling for a public consensus on
actions to cut carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Smangus, situated in Jianshih township, was the last area in Taiwan to be
supplied with electricity, Lin said. Up to 1997, the village was called he
"tribe of darkness," he said, adding that now, Smangus has become the country's
model for energy efficient lighting.</P>
      <P>The village is equipped with 874 lamps that have all been changed from
incandescent lighting to the use of energy saving bulbs and high-performance
LEDs, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin said that because of the changeover, electricity consumption in the village
is expected to drop by 60 percent a year, which would make Smangus Taiwan's most
energy efficient village.</P>
      <P>The Atayal is one of 13 major aboriginal tribes in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) chief-designate Shen Shih-hung
said Tuesday that the imposition of an energy tax will be done gradually.</P>
      <P>Shen said that in the initial stage, the government will target those who import

      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou said Monday at an event to promote Earth Day the

      <P>Shen noted that Ma spoke of a carbon dioxide tax during his presidential

consideration when imposing the energy tax.</P>
      <P>He cited as an example that while imported coal is cheap, it will produce more

    <HEADLINE>Two DPP chairmanship candidates vow to stay in race</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22 (CNA)
04/22/08  23:14:47

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two of the candidates for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
chairmanship, Trong Chai and Koo Kuan-min, both vowed Tuesday to stay in the
race, acting DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh said later that day.</P>
      <P>Speaking after meetings with both candidates, Hsieh said they agreed to accept a
coordination meeting on election and debate procedures but would not accept
coordination aimed at asking either of them to quit the race.</P>
      <P>The decisions made by DPP Legislator Chai and Koo, a former adviser to President
Chen Shui-bian, mean that a general vote among party members slated for May 18
is now inevitable.</P>
      <P>Another candidate, former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen, who is seen as a front-
runner, was expected to meet with Hsieh soon after returning from an overseas
trip Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's announcement followed speculation that Chai and Koo would be asked to
drop out of the race after Tsai registered for the chairmanship election on the
last day of registration, to create an image of party unity.</P>
      <P>However, Hsieh was quoted by party sources as saying that while producing the
party leader through coordination might prevent an election process in which
candidates will harshly criticize one another, anyone who is persuaded to quit
the race will feel they have been unfairly treated.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he also believes a general vote will give the new party leader a
mandate from the party membership, giving him or her more legitimacy to push for
party reforms, the sources went on.</P>
      <P>Both Chai and Koo proposed to Hsieh that all candidates should reach a consensus
on establishing a chairmanship election model that is free of negative attacks
on the other candidates, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Chai also suggested that the party organize more debates between the candidates,
rather than just the one already scheduled for May 10, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>The new party chief will be sworn in May 21.</P>
      <P>Hsieh tendered his resignation as chairman after he lost the March 22
presidential poll to his rival, Ma Ying-jeou of opposition Kuomintang (KMT), by
a wide margin of more than 2.2 million votes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan president-elect should be invited to visit U.S.: expert</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 22 (CNA)
04/23/08  13:02:35
(By Jorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. expert on cross-Taiwan Strait affairs has urged the Bush administration
to reconsider its decision not to invite Taiwan's president-elect  Ma Ying-jeou
to visit Washington before his inauguration.</P>
      <P>Alan D. Romberg, senior associate and director of East Asian Studies at the
Washington-based Henry L. Stimson Center, argued that the Bush administration
should invite Ma to the U.S.  for a pre-inauguration visit, saying that if Ma's
intention to visit the U.S. prior to taking office was fulfilled, it would serve
U.S. interests.</P>
      <P>He also said strong U.S. support could help Ma ease the suspicions of critics
who worry he will sell out Taiwan and forge a broad-based consensus for his
China policy.</P>
      <P>"Ma is committed  to lowering  tensions  with Beijing,  a long-standing U.S.
objective.  But his success requires strong domestic consensus, which, in turn,
depends on open American support, " Romberg wrote in an article published on the
think tank's Web site Monday.</P>
      <P>"Inviting Ma to Washington before his inauguration would signify such critical
backing. Instead, President Bush seems determined to miss this unique
opportunity to promote U.S. interests," he said.</P>
      <P>The Bush administration seems to have fallen into the realm of former Israeli
Foreign Minister Abba Eban's quip that the Arabs' "never miss an oppotunity to
miss an opportunity" with Israel, Romberg said.</P>
      <P>The scholar said the decision was apparently made hastily and without serious
reflection, perhaps based partly on assumptions about PRC objections and partly
on pique that yet another Taiwan leader was springing surprises on Washington.</P>
      <P>Ma "announced" his hope to visit Washington in answering a question from a
reporter the night of his election victory.</P>
      <P>Romberg argued the White House's decision badly misses the difference between
inviting a sitting Taiwan president and an elected one, a difference quite
evident in PRC President Hu Jintao's willingness to meet recently with Ma's vice
president-elect, Vincent Siew, at an economic conference in Hainan, southern
China.</P>
      <P>"It also ignores the fact that Ma's avowed intention is to restore trust, not
take steps that undermine it," Romberg wrote.</P>
      <P>"One assumes Ma can get beyond his disappointment, but that will not make up for
the U.S. having squandered an opportunity to establish a relationship of trust
with him -- and to convey that to the Taiwan public -- that would manifestly
serve U.S. interests, " he wrote.</P>
      <P>"It is highly unlikely this decision will be reversed. But in light of the Hu-
Siew meeting it should be, and it would serve U.S. interests if it were,"
Romberg said.</P>

    <TEXT>: The Straits Times: Resign? It won't solve the problem, says PM.

It is almost a ritual - politicians falling on their swords to appease public
anger when the unexpected happens or policies go wrong. Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong yesterday made it clear that he did not think it wise for Singapore to
engage in such political shows.

The Lianhe Zaobao: Ministers should solve the problem first, resign won't solve
the problem: PM Lee.

Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday in Parliament that top
home affairs officials should not be automatically removed or punished just
because security lapses allowed Jemaah Islamiah (JI) leader Mas Selamat Kastari
to escape a prison.

He said resign won't solve the problem, and this is not Singapore's political
culture, the first responsibility for government is going to address the issue
and solve the problem.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Sediq the 14th indigenous tribe recognized in Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet officially recognized the Sediq Wednesday, the 14th indigenous tribe
in Taiwan to gain formal status.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue during a weekly Cabinet meeting in which the recognition
was granted, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung noted that the Sediq had been previously
grouped by the government as a member of the Atayal, although the Sediq
considers itself a different tribe from the Atayal.</P>
      <P>"The recognition of the Sediq as an individual tribe is a show of respect for
the will of the ethnic group and is consistent with the principle of fairness
underlying our ethnic policy," Chang said.</P>
      <P>To honor the self-identities  of indigenous  peoples,  the government has since
2001 recognized four other indigenous tribes, namely the Thao, Kavalan, Truku
and Sakizaya, in addition to the Sediq, the premier pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to data from the Council of Indigenous Peoples, the Sediq population
totals 6,000 to 7,000 people and is mainly distributed in areas along the border
separating Nantou and Hualien counties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenous people -- the native groups that predate all other communal
groups in Taiwan -- could have originated either from the southern part of China
or from the vast Austronesian-language region.</P>
      <P>In addition to the five tribes mentioned above, the other nine tribal groups
recognized as having their own dialect and distinct culture are the Amis,
Atayal, Bunun, Paiwan, Pinuyumayan, Rukai, Saisiyat, Tsou and Yami.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu departed Wednesday on a trip that will take him to Hong
Kong and then to Europe, with his visit to the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) to lobby to restore baseball as an Olympic event one of the highlights of
the trip.</P>
      <P>The sport's appearance at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing in August may be its
last after the sport was voted out as an Olympic event three years ago,
beginning with the London Games in 2012.</P>
      <P>Hu has developed good relations  with officials  from the International Baseball
Federation (IBF) after Taichung City hosted several international baseball
championships over the past year, and he was invited by the group to lobby the
IOC to reinstate baseball as part of the Summer Games.</P>
      <P>During  his stay in Switzerland,  Hu will also visit the headquarters of the
Switzerland-based IBF to further consolidate Taichung's relations with the
world's baseball governing body and seek more opportunties to host international
baseball tournaments in the future.</P>
      <P>Hu has endeavored to turn Taichung City into Taiwan's "baseball capital" since
he became mayor of he city in 2001.</P>
      <P>Eager to bring the sport's standard in Taichung to international levels, Hu
built the 15,000-seat Intercontinental Baseball Stadium to have an acceptable
venue  in the city to host international tournaments.</P>
      <P>Since its completion in 2007, the stadium has hosted the Asian Baseball
Championship, the Baseball World Cup, and the 2008 Final Olympic Qualifying
Tournament.</P>
      <P>Prior to heading to Switzerland, the Taichung mayor will first visit Hong Kong,
where he will attend a seminar Friday to promote tourism in the central Taiwan
city.</P>
      <P>At the seminar, Hu is expected to join Stanley Yen, president of Taiwan's Landis
Hotel and Resorts, to exchange views with Hong Kong travel agency operators on
tourism promotion in Taichung and issues related to future direct charter
flights between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Regular direct charter flights between Taiwan and China, a key plank in
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's program, are expected to begin sometime this
year, and Hu is worried about the impact they could have on Taichung Airport.</P>
      <P>He told the Central News Agency recently that opening charter flights at other
airports in Taiwan could hurt existing charters between Taichung and Hong Kong
and Macau, but suggested the drops in passenger load factors could be offset by
offering arrival visas to Hong Kong and Macau residents.</P>
      <P>Following the seminar in Hong Kong, Hu will first head to Britain to solicit
investment before heading to Switzerland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators said Wednesday that they are worried about service quality and
quarantine control if an influx of Chinese tourists visit Taiwan later this
year, but officials assured them that everything is ready.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers expressed their concerns at a legislative committee during which
officials from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) were
invited to brief lawmakers on preparations for hosting Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou has pledged to open Taiwan fully to Chinese
tourists in July.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Hung-chun said he worried about the quality of
service offered to Chinese tourists, noting that some Chinese visitors have
described their trips in Taiwan as getting up early, going to bed late, eating
poorly and rushing around all day.</P>
      <P>If Ma's pledge is put into practice and up to 3,000 Chinese tourists come to
Taiwan per day, Lee said there might not be enough international-standard hotels
to accommodate them, and the interests of local tourists could be undermined on
weekends.</P>
      <P>Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the MOTC, responded
that there are 190 hotels in Taiwan rated three stars or higher with a total of
26,000 rooms and 600 other standard hotels with 50,000 rooms.</P>
      <P>"There will be no problem for the hotels to accommodate 3,000 Chinese tourists
visiting Taiwan daily," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yeh Yi-jin pointed out that China has never been "transparent about
its quarantine control, " and she questioned how the government is going to
conduct effective quarantine if Taiwan opens up fully to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Vice Transportation and Communications Minister Ho Nuan-hsien said quarantine
control will definitely be included in cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>On possible price gouging by local vendors, Lai said the bureau will ask travel
agencies to arrange for Chinese tourists to visit shops recognized by the
bureau, establish a monitoring mechanism and guarantee tourists full refunds if
they return items they find unsatisfactory.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The unemployment rate among university graduates reached 4.48 percent in March,
marking a record high, according  to the latest statistics  released  Tuesday by
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference held to present the figures, Huang Chien-chung,
the deputy director of the DGBAS' Fourth Department, said that although the
figure marks a new high, much of it is "voluntary or short-term unemployment
that isn't expected to have an impact on the overall job market."</P>
      <P>Huang said that as higher education has become more universal in Taiwan over the
past several years, the number of college graduates has increased significantly
from about 89,000 in 1997 to 282,000 last year.</P>
      <P>The March unemployment rate among college graduates has gradually increased each
year from 2.37 percent in 2001 to 4.48 percent this year, according to the DGBAS
tallies.</P>
      <P>The figure was the highest among all groups classified by education level, the
statistics show.</P>
      <P>A total of 109,000 college graduates were unemployed in March, according to the
tallies.</P>
      <P>Huang said that one of the reasons the figure is particularly high is that a
significant percentage of those unemployed were recent graduates and relatively
young, adding that college graduates tend to change jobs more frequently and
have higher standards in searching for employment.</P>
      <P>He noted that the DGBAS tallies also show that 2.303 million college graduates
were employed in March, up by 222,000 over the figure for the same month last
year.</P>
      <P>He said this figure illustrates the fruitful results of efforts to increase the
quality of the talent pool in the local job market.</P>

      <P>China's new rules covering civil lawsuits downgrade Taiwan's status and
jeopardize the interests and rights of Taiwanese people if they are involved in
lawsuits there, a Taiwanese official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The remarks came after China's supreme court announced new provisions earlier in
the day that Chinese courts can deliver civil lawsuit documents to Taiwanese
people involved in Chinese lawsuits via mail, fax or e-mail.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the new provisions, if Chinese courts cannot deliver the
documents or do not know the whereabouts of Taiwanese citizens involved in the
cases, they can make a public announcement for three months in newspapers or
authoritative Web sites inside or outside China.</P>
      <P>Liu Te-shun, vice chairman of the Taipei-based Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) ,
said that if foreign countries want to deliver legal documents to Taiwan, they
must respect Taiwan's judicial sovereignty by going through diplomatic channels
to reach the interested parties.</P>
      <P>Prior to the announcement of the new rules, Chinese courts often delivered
documents in civil lawsuits to courts in Taiwan, and the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) would help verify them, Liu explained.</P>
      <P>After verification, local courts will help deliver the documents to Taiwanese
citizens and then the SEF would send a notice to courts in China, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The new rules, however, signal that China has extended its jurisdiction over
Taiwan and considers Taiwan as a part of China, Liu pointed out.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the delivery of judicial documents between Hong Kong and China or
between Macau and China was decided by bilateral negotiations and that it was
therefore "inappropriate" for China to unilaterally decide that its domestic
rules can apply to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu also pointed out that courts in China do not deliver legal
documents to Chinese citizens via e-mail. "Why should Taiwan alone accept such
an e-mail? This is very ill-considered."</P>
      <P>Using public announcements as a way of valid delivery will jeopardize the rights
and interests of Taiwanese citizens, he asserted.</P>
      <P>If Taiwanese citizens are named as defendants in a case but do not learn about
Chinese court announcements and miss hearings, the courts can rule against them,
contending they did not want to appear in court.</P>
      <P>The new rules on lawsuit document delivery also were symbolic of the "one-China"
principle, which is unacceptable to Taiwan as the principle regards Taiwan as a
Chinese province, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>Liu said that Taiwan and China should soon authorize the SEF and the Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , respectively,
to hold talks on the delivery of legal documents to protect individual rights on
either side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The council will soon call meetings with the SEF and other agencies to discuss
how to deal with the impact of the new Chinese rules, Liu said.</P>

      <P>Aboriginal college students tend to drop out during their academic years due to
economic reasons, failure to keep up with their non-aboriginal peers and various
other factors, a legislator claimed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a session of the Legislative Yuan Education and Culture Committee,
Kao Chin Su-mei, a member of the legislative caucus of the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union, said indigenous young men and women can enter  universities
and colleges  under a preferential entrance program.</P>
      <P>Many of them, however, drop out of school in the middle of their courses due to
lack of special academic assistance, according to Kao Chin.</P>
      <P>Some of the students find themselves being left behind their non-aboriginal
peers after studying for a period of time, prompting them to leave school
without finishing their studies, Kao Chin said.</P>
      <P>Some drop out as a result of financial difficulties as they usually have to
leave their remote hometowns to attend colleges or universities located in
cities, she noted.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin said the trend of aboriginal students dropping out of school "seems" to
have risen steadily in recent years.</P>
      <P>However, Vice Education Minister Chou Tsan-deh disagreed with her point of view,
pointing out that the number of aboriginal college students quitting school has
in fact not risen.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, 171 aboriginal students were admitted to colleges and
universities in 2002. The number nearly doubled to 332 in 2003 and jumped to 714
in 2007.</P>
      <P>Chou said the average aboriginal student is unlikely to flunk, since most
colleges and universities operate resource grouping classes to help them adapt
better academically.</P>
      <P>As to their financial difficulties, Chou said the Ministry of Education could
coordinate  with the Cabinet-level  Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP) or the
Ministry of the Interior in the future to work out subsidy plans for aboriginal
students under a social welfare program.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Chiang-yi, a vice chairman of the CIP, said that the situation of
aboriginal students dropping out has improved in recent years as a result of the
implementation of various support programs.</P>
      <P>Lin said most aboriginal students who quit their studies do so for financial
reasons.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Listing vitamin products as drugs `international trend': DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
04/23/08  17:59:59
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to an outcry over the high price of vitamin products in Taiwan, an
official of the Department of Health (DOH) explained Wednesday that it is
because most vitamins are marketed in Taiwan as drugs.</P>
      <P>Out of concern that some vitamins, such as vitamins A, D and E, can accumulate
in the body and can cause harm, the government has categorized certain vitamins
as drug products in an effort to prevent overdoses, said Liao Chi-chou, director
of pharmaceutical affairs under the DOH, who said the move is "meeting an
international trend."</P>
      <P>Liao offered the explanation in response to questions from reporters on a news
report carried that day by the United Daily News, which described local
consumers as "fatheads" for paying a much higher price for the brand-named multi
vitamin Centrum in Taiwan than it costs in the United States.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent ruling by the Taipei District Court, the report said that unlike
more than 100 other countries, Taiwan lists vitamins as drugs. As a result,
imported vitamins have to receive DOH permission before entering the local
market, which is why vitamins sold in Taiwan cost several times more than the
prices charged elsewhere, according to the ruling.</P>
      <P>While ruling a pharmacy owner innocent on the charge of selling banned drugs,
the court suggested that the government review and amend the laws governing
pharmaceutical affairs in an effort to defend consumers' rights, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Su-yi of the Luck Star Pharmacy in downtown Taipei was indicted after she
was found reselling Centrum that her friends had brought in from the United
States. She was freed after the court ruled that the product was not a banned
drug.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, Liao pointed out, vitamins whose levels surpass three-fold the
advised daily dose are categorized as drugs, while those under that level are
regarded as food supplements.</P>
      <P>Liao also stated that a much larger production amount in the U.S. is also the
factor that leads to Centrum being cheaper there, even though the product is
manufactured in Hsinchu by the Wyeth Taiwan Corp.</P>
      <P>The Wyeth Taiwan-produced Centrum is priced at around NT$600 (US$19.8) per 120
tablets -- NT$5 per tablet -- while Centrum made by Wyeth's mother company in
the U.S. costs only US$17.67 per 523 tablets -- NT$1.6 per tablet.</P>
      <P>Several lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan expressed concern Wednesday over the
issue, with Legislator Ho Tsai-feng of the opposition Kuomintang accusing the
DOH of attempting to profit from pharmaceutical factories.</P>
      <P>In response, the DOH promised to invite experts within 10 days to discuss the
issue in order to outline proper measures for vitamin trading management within
one month, Liao said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite having less than a month left in office, the caretaker government will
spare no efforts to prevent problems from flooding as the annual monsoon season
approaches in May, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at an Executive Yuan session after listening to a
briefing of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' (MOEA) Water Resources Agency on
the prevention of floods and inundation.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which has held the presidency for the
past eight years, will transfer power to the opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT)  when
the KMT's Ma Ying-jeou is inaugurated as president May 20.</P>
      <P>Chang asked the MOEA to instruct local governments in cleaning drainage systems,
dredging rivers, and checking water gates, so as to work toward the goal of
"zero-damage" during the rainy period from May through November.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, floods are usually caused by heavy rains during the plum rain season,
or the East Asian rainy season, from May to June and the typhoon season from
July to November.</P>
      <P>Heavy rainfalls during the period can also cause high turbidity, leading to
water supply problems, which have affected the Shihsmen Reservoir in Taoyuan
County in northern Taiwan and the Kao-Ping River Weir in Kaohsiung County in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOEA will strengthen emergency measures for these two places to prevent the
same problems from occurring this year, Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the central government has implemented an eight-year program
with a budget of NT$116 billion (US$3.83 billion) since June 2006, to solve
flood problems in the nation's flood-prone areas.</P>
      <P>Chang expressed the hope that with the MOEA's active promotion, 90 percent of
the first phase of the project will be completed by June this year.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, director-general of the MOEA's Water Resources Agency, said the
government's flood prevention work has improved from experience and training
during past two years, and the MOEA will make full efforts in preventing and
reducing damages by floods.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC) is working on guidelines to
further cut carbon dioxide emissions nationwide by 140 million tons by 2025, as
part of efforts to reduce Taiwan's greenhouse gas emissions to the 2000 level,
NSC officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's carbon dioxide emissions in 2000 was 214 million tons, and is forecast
to top 531 million tons by 2005. The cabinet has set a goal of reducing the
country's carbon dioxide emissions to the 2000 level by 2025.</P>
      <P>"This means that carbon dioxide levels have to be cut by 317 million tons, "
said NSC Deputy Minister Yang Hung-duen. He added that the guidelines already
established would lead to a reduction of 177 million tons of carbon dioxide
emissions, but the NSC has yet finalize a plan for cutting another 140 million
tons of carbon dioxide emissions to meet the goal.</P>
      <P>Yang said the council is now considering a combination of methods, such as
imposing a carbon emission tax, joining global carbon  trading  networks,
encouraging  eco-friendly  economic development, regulating industry proportion
of emissions, seeking alternative energy sources, and developing green
technology.</P>
      <P>NSC officials said that after the council has drafted the guidelines, they would
still be subject to inter-agency reviews and cabinet approval.</P>

      <P>Ambassador to Paraguay David Hu has urged Paraguayan  President-elect  Fernando
Lugo not to forge closer relations with China at the expense of its diplomatic
ties with Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lugo said at a news conference after he won Sunday's election that Paraguay is
the only country in the region that does not have ties with China and that "if
other countries have established relations with China... we will not be left
behind."</P>
      <P>Lugo, whose victory ended more than six decades of rule by the center-right
Colorado Party, had said during his campaign that he would like to establish
ties with China if he won the election, which gave rise to speculations that
Taiwan might lose its only diplomatic ally in South America to China.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh related that Hu, in meetings with Lugo before and
after the election, had said that "Taiwan hopes to strengthen its diplomatic
relations with Paraguay. If Paraguay can expand its links with China without
compromising its ties with Taiwan, I think it will be all right."</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that Hu has repeatedly urged Paraguay not to develop relations with
other countries at Taiwan's expense.</P>
      <P>Simon Ko, director-general of MOFA's Department of Central and South American
Affairs, said that Taiwan must respect the sovereignty of the South American
nation and therefore cannot oppose any plans it might have to establish ties
with China, but can only hope that Taiwan-Paraguay relations would not be
compromised.</P>
      <P>"We are, of course, open to diplomatic ties between our allies and China, if
relations with Taiwan are not compromised, " Ko said, "but the point is that
China does not accept dual recognition -- at least, not at present, " he added.</P>
      <P>Paraguay and Taiwan established diplomatic relations in 1957.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of Hsinchu city government officials successfully took part
recently in a world high-tech exposition under Taiwan's national title, rather
than as "China" as has been the case at previous events, according to a city
government statement.</P>
      <P>The delegation from the northern county in Taiwan attended the fifth WTA Techno
Mart of the World Technopolis Association (WTA) -- hosted by Dubai April 14-16
-- under the name, "Taiwan, Republic of China" for the first time, the statement
issued Wednesday read.</P>
      <P>This was a result of Hsinchu City Mayor Lin Junq-tzer's protest at the last expo
two years ago against the organizers' move to identify the Taiwanese delegation
as being from China, in brochures designed to introduce member cities, the
statement noted.</P>
      <P>It also marked the first time that the organizers recognized Taiwan's national
status, Lin said in the statement.</P>
      <P>Lin, who led the delegation,  added that at past events, delegations  from
Taiwan had lodged strong protests  with the organizers on grounds that Taiwan's
sovereignty was being denigrated.</P>
      <P>For example, when the event was first held, a delegation comprised of Tainan
city officials refused to take part, in protest over the name issue, Lin
recalled.</P>
      <P>At this year's event, however, the association and the host city apparently
attached great importance to Hsinchu City's statement of protest last time, he
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the delegations from the Chinese cities of Nanjing and Hefei were
also respectful of Taiwan's designation this time, he said.</P>
      <P>At many other international forums, Chinese delegates often reacted strongly
over the name issue, in light of China's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the Hsinchu City delegation also displayed Taiwan's national flag
on a banner on its booth at the event.</P>
      <P>The association praised Hsinchu City's high-tech development and negotiated to
have the city host the event in 2010, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>The city will submit an application at the annual meeting of the association to
be held in South Korea later this year, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The WTA, which was established in 1997 in South Korea, is a multilateral
cooperative international organization comprised mainly of city governments from
around the world, with the aim of linking science and technology advancement
with local development.</P>

      <P>The Super Mill Group (SMG), a breakfast restaurant chain, on Wednesday donated
500 breakfasts to the Child Welfare League Foundation (CWLF) to offer
underprivileged children a nutritious meal.</P>
      <P>CWLF, established in Taipei in 1991, is a non-profit organization devoted to
child welfare, and provides both direct and indirect services. It also advocates
children's rights and strives to raise awareness of child welfare issues.</P>
      <P>SMG Vice President Yeh Song-ji said at a press conference Wednesday that he
hopes the gesture will serve to generate greater concern for children in need.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the donation will help raise public awareness of the plight of
underprivileged children and generate more love and concern for them, " said
Yeh, whose chain operates more than a thousand breakfast eateries around Taiwan
under the name "My Warm Day."</P>
      <P>Noting that the CWLF is committed to assisting some 2,000 children from 1,300
underprivileged families, Alicia Wang, chief executive officer of the CWLF,
expressed appreciation to the breakfast chain on behalf of the children.</P>
      <P>"SMG has indeed given our children a very good gift," she said.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, about 40 percent of the children who receive assistance from
the CWLF are not covered under the national health insurance scheme. She urged
the general public and enterprises "to help those children who really need
financial assistance."</P>
      <P>"There is still room for the public to assist the children in various ways, such
as helping to pay their daily expenses, tuition fees, and medical bills," Wang
told a Central News Agency reporter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fallow land to be used for corn, not biofuel: new agriculture chief</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 23 (CNA)
04/23/08  18:53:29
(By Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's incoming agricultural czar said Tuesday that as the country is unable
to achieve an economy of scale in the production of crops for biofuel, its
220,000 hectares of fallow land should be used to grow corn for feed instead.</P>
      <P>Such a plan could help the nation reduce its reliance on imports of animal feed
as well as help Taiwan maintain meat prices at a stable level even as global
food prices skyrocket, said Chen Wu-chung.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has been designated as the new minsiter of the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture (COA) in the new administration of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou,
said in an interview with the Central News Agency that utilizing fallow land in
this way will also help revitalize rural villages.</P>
      <P>He argued that there is currently not enough land to make the growing of crops
for biofuel in Taiwan practical.</P>
      <P>As the ongoing international food crisis has led to steep price increases, Chen
said, making use of Taiwan's fallow land to grow corn for feed and to build up
the nation's corn supply is a good policy.</P>
      <P>Corn can be stored for long periods, with no threat that possible overproduction
will lead to a glut.</P>
      <P>Commenting on current COA Minister Su Jia-chyuan's goal of encouraging
production of crops for biofuel, Chen said the policy has proven to be
unfeasible.</P>
      <P>He noted that according to the COA's own tallies, it costs at least NT$51
(US$1.70) to produce one liter of biofuel from soya in Taiwan, which is much
more expensive than abroad.</P>
      <P>Using other crops, such as rapeseed and sunflower, to try to create economies of
scale for the production of biofuel also have proven unsuccessful in Taiwan for
a variety of reasons, including damage by pests and limited land, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan uses about 5 million tons of corn for feed annually, according to Fang
Ching-chuan,  head of the National  Animal Industry Foundation's livestock
division.</P>
      <P>As one hectare of land can produce about 5 tons of corn for feed, Fang said that
if the 220,000 hectares of fallow land in Taiwan are used to grow corn for one
season, then 20 percent of the nation's annual demand can be met.</P>
      <P>Shipping corn from the United States to Taiwan costs about US$70-80 per ton,
Fand said. Using 1.1 million tons of corn grown in Taiwan could therefore save
the country about US$88 million in shipping fees alone, he said. The savings are
even higher if one includes fees for customs, storage, insurance and internal
transportation, he added.</P>
      <P>The savings would be passed on to the main users of corn feed in Taiwan, namely
livestock and poultry farmers, which in turn would help keep meat prices in the
country under control, Fang said.</P>
      <P>Having a stable domestic supply of corn for feed would also be beneficial in
terms of national security considerations, Fang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su Tzung-chen, head of the COA's foodstuffs division, agreed that
corn is a suitable choice because it is resistant to drought and can be
harvested twice a year. He added that technological advances in Taiwan's
agricultural industry have made it possible to produce six to seven tons of corn
on one hectare of land.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Su said, the COA launched a program at the start of this year to
encourage farmers to grow corn for feed on fallow land. Under the program, the
council is offering up to NT$45,000 per harvest on a contract basis to farmers
for each hectare of corn that they plant.</P>
      <P>The program is aimed at lowering Taiwan's reliance on foreign feed grains and at
reducing livestock and poultry farmers' costs, he said.</P>

      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration has funneled an average of
NT$290.9 billion per year into the promotion of social welfare over the past
eight years, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The amount is 1.75 times as much as the average of NT$166 billion per year that
was spent by the former Kuomintang (KMT) administration during the 1993-1999
period, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The premier was speaking during a weekly Cabinet meeting in which he reviewed
the DPP administration's achievements in promoting social welfare programs.</P>
      <P>In terms of economic security, the programs introduced during the DPP
administration included the provision of an allowance of NT$3,000 per month to
citizens aged 65 and over, the launch of a new retirement program for workers
and an increase of the monthly allowance for elderly farmers to NT$6,000.</P>
      <P>Measures to reduce the burden on local households included the establishment of
an after-school care system for elementary school children and a community
babysitting system and long-term care program for the disabled, children and
patients suffering from chronic disease,  as well as free kindergarten
enrollment for disadvantaged five-year-olds, Chang went on.</P>
      <P>Turning to programs targeting minority groups, he said the DPP administration
established a NT$3 billion fund aimed at helping foreign spouses assimilate into
Taiwanese society, enacted a basic law on indigenous rights, launched an
indigenous television channel, allowed indigenous citizens to start receiving a
pension at 55 and lowered the unemployment rate among the indigenous population
from 9.24 percent in 2001 to 4.36 percent at present.</P>
      <P>On steps to enhance the status of women, Chang noted that Taiwan has now seen
its first female vice president and vice premier.</P>
      <P>In terms of efforts to promote public health, Chang said the satisfaction rating
for medical visits in Taiwan has now increased to 77 percent, while Taiwan's
successful National Health Insurance program has also received media coverage in
the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, thanks to the government's efforts to improve the social security
network, the disparity between the rich and the poor has narrowed from 6.39-fold
to 6.01-fold, while the unemployment rate has declined from a high of 4.6
percent to 3.9 percent, Chang said.</P>

      <P>Former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen said Wednesday that overseas members of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are worried about the DPP's future after the
party's two election defeats in January and March.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who has entered the DPP chairmanship race, made the remarks after
returning from a visit to Los Angeles, where she attended the 2008 annual
convention of the North America Taiwanese Women's Association last weekend and
gave a keynote speech on Taiwan's economic development over the past eight
years.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the DPP members and supporters she met during her trip had expressed
extreme worry about the party's future after the party lost both the legislative
election on Jan. 12 and the presidential election on March 22 to the opposition
Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>"They expressed the hope that the DPP can get back on its feet as soon as
possible and that a capable leader will guide the party out of the shadow of
defeat and bring it back to its heyday," she said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether she will coordinate with the other two candidates for the DPP
chairmanship position before the party makes a final decision on whether a May
18 election is really necessary, Tsai said the matter is up to incumbent DPP
Chairman Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Some DPP members have proposed that the next DPP chair should be produced
through intra-party coordination rather than through an election, but a May 18
election appears inevitable because although Tsai, 52, is the front runner in
the race, her two rivals -- former senior presidential adviser Koo Kwan-min, 82,
and DPP Legislator Trong Chai, 73 -- have both told Hsieh they will not take
part in any coordination that has a predetermined purpose of persuading them to
yield to Tsai.</P>
      <P>Chai has expressed doubt about Tsai's suitability for the role, describing her
as a "rookie " as far as party affairs are concerned, while Koo, a staunch
Taiwan Independence advocate, has said he feels duty-bound to run so that he can
"try to restore the party's faith in itself."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Production glut causes slump in carnation prices</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mother's Day is around the corner, but the price of carnations, the floral
symbol of the occasion, has remained unusually weak because of a production
glut, agricultural sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-hsiung, a flower farmer in Changhua County's Tienwei township in
central Taiwan, said the price of locally produced carnations rose to a high of
NT$70 to NT$80 per 10-stem bunch around Mother's Day last year.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by such profitability, many Changhua farmers switched to carnation
plantation this season, with total acreage exceeding last year's level by more
than 50 percent.</P>
      <P>"Expanded plantation has let to an oversupply and a resulting severe price
slump," Wang lamented.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Wang said, wholesale prices are hovering around NT$20 a bunch or
have fallen as low as NT$15 at the country's five flower auction markets.</P>
      <P>"Such prices can hardly cover production costs, not to mention any profits for
growers," Wang said.</P>
      <P>With just two weeks to go before Mother's Day, which falls on May 11 this year,
many blooming carnations are left untended on farms in Tienwei, one of Taiwan's
major floral production hubs.</P>
      <P>The plight of "the more flowers plucked, the more money lost," coupled with a
manpower shortage, has discouraged flower farmers from cutting mature
carnations, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>With a number of unsold carnations in his inventory, Wang said he doesn't expect
prices to rebound to last year's level in the coming two weeks. "The wholesale
prices will fluctuate between NT$50 and NT$60 at most," he predicted.</P>
      <P>To help promote carnation sales, Liu Shu-fang, a Changhua County councilor,
launched a campaign Tuesday, urging government agencies, corporations and social
groups to buy more locally grown carnations to celebrate Mother's Day.</P>
      <P>The Tienwei township government will also organize a promotional program this
weekend to boost carnation sales.</P>
      <P>Wang and many flower farmers in the county, however, said they would like the
government to assist them in transforming their farms into tourist gardens, with
visitors allowed to pick fresh carnations on their own as a form of recreation
and an inexpensive way to enjoy the beauty of fresh carnations.</P>
      <P>"We believe that is the best way to help us cut labor costs and lower our
losses," Wang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's official environmental impact assessment (EIA) system was denounced
Wednesday by a group of scholars and students as a "rubber stamp" for
construction interests.</P>
      <P>The group of more than 20 students from three prestigious universities in
Taiwan, along with some scholars, made the accusation at a press conference
under the slogan, "impact assessment that fails to find impact."</P>
      <P>According to the results of the students' research, which was conducted by
reviewing 350 EA reports and interviewing several EIA committee members, 70 to
80 percent of EIA reports usually conclude that planned construction projects
would have little or no impact on Taiwan's environment.</P>
      <P>"If all these construction projects, including those of the Formosa Plastics
Group, are seen as having no impact on Taiwan, it means that the EIA system
cannot find the impact," said Li Jia-da.</P>
      <P>The student researchers also disclosed that EIA committee members usually have
on average 9 days to read a report before a review meeting is held, and that
they are usually assigned a new report about every 2.06 days.</P>
      <P>In addition, many EIA committee members have received telephone calls from
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) officials, "who expressed concerns
(about the construction plans under review)," and one committee member was even
replaced because of his differences with the nation's top environmental agency,
the group said.</P>
      <P>"EIA members are interfering with the administration, and their professionalism
is not respected, " said Li. "The EIA's reports are influenced by construction
interests, and under such circumstances, its assessment system is nothing more
than a rubber stamp."</P>
      <P>Urging that the incoming government under president-elect Ma Ying-jeou to
improve the EIA system, Yu Yue-hwa, a professor at the Graduate Institute of
Environmental Engineering, National Taiwan University (NTU), suggested that
serving on the EIA committee should be a full-time job.</P>
      <P>Most of the members are professors or experts who serve on an ad hoc basis on
the EIA committee.</P>
      <P>Liou Ming-lone, chairman of Environmental Quality Protection Foundation and a
professor at NTU, suggested further that the report on the controversial Suao-
Hualien Expressway, which is slated to reviewed by the EIA committee Friday,
should be returned to the Ministry of the Transportation and Communications and
that the new government should decide whether or not to implement the project.</P>
      <P>"The role of the EPA should not be limited to reducing water and electricity
usage or cleaning the streets -- it has a mission to protect Taiwan's
environment," said Liou. He further encouraged EPA Minister-designate Shen Shih-
hung to play a more active role in the incoming government, which sees the
economy as its top priority.</P>
      <P>The 86-km Suao-Hualien Expressway project, which was designed mainly to boost
the economy in eastern Taiwan, has drawn repeated fire from environmentalists
who have questioned its necessity and have expressed grave concerns over its
potential negative impact on the ecological system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Food price rise drives COA to gear policy on fallow farmland</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (C0A) has been working on a program to restore
cultivation of Taiwan's fallow farmland to tackle surging food prices, COA
Deputy Chairman Lee Jen-chyuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>While giving a special report at a legislative committee meeting on the
government's plan to deal with a looming global food crisis, Lee told lawmakers
that the cabinet-level COA has decided to slash subsidies for the 220,000
hectares of farmland that has been lying fallow across Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The subsidies, aimed at discouraging overproduction, were imposed after Taiwan
joined the World Trade Organization and began allowing imports of rice from
abroad.</P>
      <P>As global food prices skyrocket in recent weeks, Lee said the COA is now
evaluating measures to encourage farmers to resume cultivation on some of the
land.</P>
      <P>It is planning to urge farmers to grow corn for corn feed on 12,000 hectares of
the fallow farmland this year and on 30,000 hectares next year, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imports 5 million metric tons of corn feed every year at a high price,
which has caused a heavy burden on animal and crop farmers.</P>
      <P>As the price of corn feed has jumped recently, prices for meat have also risen.</P>
      <P>In addition to using up to 30,000 hectares of the fallow farmland to grow corn
in 2008, the COA plans to use another 20,000 hectares and 16,000 hectares for
cultivating rice and for forestation, respectively, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The remaining fallow farmland will be used to produce other kinds of grains that
will not cause a glut in the domestic market, Lee said.</P>
      <P>After cultivation is resumed on the farmland, the land's use will not be changed
to "non-agricultural" purposes, Lee assured lawmakers.</P>
      <P>In line with the COA's measures, Taiwan's rice paddies are expected to increase
by 20,000 hectares per year from the current 260,000 hectares and its rice
production will rise by around 100,000 metric tons annually, Lee said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Lee said, the COA will largely reduce its subsidies for fallow
farmland -- currently at NT$45,000 (US$1,485) per hectare for each harvest --
to push farmers to restore cultivation. The new level of subsidy is being
studied and has not yet been determined, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Yu-tsai, director of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency,
the government's policy of subsidizing fallow farmland has had a negative effect
on the local agricultural sector's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Compared to other Asian countries, however, Taiwan's rice prices remain
relatively stable, having increased by only 13 percent this year, Huang pointed
out last week.</P>
      <P>And to cope with possible food shortages, the government has always maintained a
safe level of rice stocks -- some 310,000 tons at present -- which can be
released in emergencies, he said.</P>

      <P>A recent TV commercial in Taiwan showing a family being advised to replace their
old air conditioner to save on electricity bills so they can buy a new computer
for their child has been blasted by local activists as touting a consumption
concept that will only accelerate global warming.</P>
      <P>Pan Han-chiang, a member of the Taiwan Environmental Action Network,  said it
was a typical advertisement in Taiwan that capitalizes on consumer concerns
about global warming.</P>
      <P>However,  while it might appear to focus on environmental protection, the ad is
essentially encouraging yet more consumption, Pan said.</P>
      <P>He also added that in the ad, "the money saved from electricity bills is used to
buy a new computer, but in the end, the electricity bills will still increase."</P>
      <P>He   described    the   "production-to-advertisement-to- consumption-to-
production" commercial model as the main cause of accelerating global warming.</P>
      <P>Robin Winkler,  a local lawyer and long-term environmental activist, said that
overconsumption and the globalization of products have expanded  the scale  of
many economies  but have driven environmental protection out of control.</P>
      <P>"If governments do not change their thinking on GDP-based economy, the situation
will only get worse," warned Winkler, also a former member of the environmental
impact evaluation committee of the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA).</P>
      <P>"Reducing consumption and returning to a simple life are the only solutions," he
went on.</P>
      <P>Products that are over-consumed in Taiwan include not just electronics but also
disposable items such as chopsticks, bottled water and drinks, paper diapers,
toilet paper and tissues, and plastic bags.</P>
      <P>Citing disposable chopsticks as an example, Liu Ming-long, chairman of the
Environmental Quality Protection Foundation (EQPF) , said that Taiwan consumes
some 3 billion pairs of disposable chopsticks every year.</P>
      <P>The chopsticks in turn produce nearly 70,000 tonnes of garbage and 92,700 tonnes
of carbon dioxide emissions, Liu said, adding that the carbon dioxide emissions
do not include those released during the importing process.</P>
      <P>Although polyethylene  terephthalate  (PET)  bottles can be recycled, many of
them are still thrown into the regular garbage after use, the EPA said.</P>
      <P>The EPA suggested that the public should continue to use PET bottles after
finishing the drink they originally contained, saying that using the bottle 20
times saves the equivalent amount of CO2 required to produce a new PET bottle.</P>
      <P>To help save the Earth, environmental protection advocates urged, the public can
also use air conditioners less often, drive less often, wear cotton or linen
clothes rather than man-made fiber garments, eat locally grown fruit more often
and reject using disposable goods.</P>

      <P>Staff of Changhua County's Public Health Bureau went on the streets Wednesday to
urge people to quit smoking, hoping that an upfront and personal approach might
raise public awareness about the dangers of cigarettes.</P>
      <P>The 12 staff members, led by bureau director-general Yeh Yen-poh, showed posters
containing information about the dangers of smoking to pedestrians and shop
owners along the streets in the county's Changhua City.</P>
      <P>They also encouraged smokers on the streets to join the national "Quit and Win"
campaign, which was organized jointly by the John Tung Foundation and health
departments and bureaus in Taiwan's local governments.</P>
      <P>Participants in the campaign must stop smoking from May 2-29, and after a
medical evaluation  and an assessment  by the person supervising the
contestants, the successful candidates will qualify for a lucky draw to win a
top prize of NT$600,000 (US$19,800).</P>
      <P>Those who are over 18 and have smoked for at least one year can sign up for the
competition, Yeh said, adding that smokers may also seek professional help from
doctors on how to give up smoking.</P>
      <P>Smoking is a serious public health problem that causes many diseases such as
heart diseases, lung diseases, eye problems, as well as risks for women and
babies.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the World Health Organization showed that about 5 million
people died of diseases related to tobacco hazards around the world every year.</P>
      <P>Giving up smoking will reduce people's chances of getting diseases in their
respiratory and circulatory systems, and also lower risks for getting stroke and
cancer, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>He offered four tips to help those who want to quit smoking stay off cigarettes
and live a nicotine-free life, including: taking deep breaths, drinking cold
water, jumping after stretching, and brushing one's teeth or washing one's face
to refresh oneself.</P>

      <P>Shrinking exports to the United States, one of Taiwan's major trading partners,
has not caused as great an impact as expected, thanks to Taiwan's strategy of
diversifying its overseas markets, officials of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CEPD statistics showed that Taiwan's exports to the U.S. recorded a year-on-year
decline of 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2008, but that in the same period
exports to Asian countries, excluding Japan, registered a growth of 24.8
percent.</P>
      <P>The figures indicate that Taiwan's exports have not been heavily affected by the
U.S. subprime mortgage crisis that began in the third quarter of 2007 and has
since battered the U.S. economy.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, some scholars had predicted an economic recession in the
U.S. and other industrial countries would hit exports and economic growth in
emerging and developing economies in East Asia, including the "four Asian
Dragons" of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea, as well as China and
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>Citing the biannual East Asia Update issued by the World Bank in April, the CEPD
said although the economic slowdown in the U.S. had impacted on exports of
emerging and developing East Asian economies, the effect was less than expected
because of an increasing demand in other emerging economies around the world.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the changes in Taiwan's export market, the CEPD pointed out that
Taiwan's exports to the U.S. dropped to 13 percent of the total in 2007, from
23.4 percent in 2000. However exports to other Asian countries, excluding Japan,
increased to 60.1 percent from 41 percent during the same period, the CEPD said.</P>

      <P>The drug Nexavar has proved effective in preventing the growth and spread of
liver cancer, the most deadly type of malignancy in Taiwan, two gastroenterology
specialists announced at a press conference Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Nexavar was first used to treat kidney cancer in 2005 and has been approved in
more than 50 countries since then, said Wang Chung-kwe, the deputy
superintendent of the Ren-ai branch of the Taipei City Hospital.</P>
      <P>In international clinical research, Nexavar was found effective in prolonging
the lives of liver-cancer patients in the terminal stages by about 4 to 6
months, said Wang. The drug works by reducing the blood supply to the cancer
cells and by blocking tumor cell signals so that the cancer cells cannot grow
and divide, he explained. It has few side effects, one of which is diarrhea, he
added.</P>
      <P>The drug is now under review by the Department of Health, and "we believe it
will soon be approved," Wang said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, about 9,800 new cases of liver cancer are recorded each year, and
only 15 to 20 percent of the patients are suitable for surgical treatment,
according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Most liver cancer patients cannot undergo surgery because the tumors are often
detected in the terminal phase, and are often accompanied by liver sclerosis.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Wang also announced that the Taiwan Liver Cancer
Association (TLCA) , the first of its kind in the country, was established in
January.</P>
      <P>"With the TLCA, we hope to provide a platform for medical professionals
nationwide to exchange their clinical experiences regarding liver cancer
treatment," said Wang.</P>
      <P>He added that one of the association's goals is to establish liver cancer
departments in hospitals.</P>
      <P>"Research on liver cancer in Taiwan is more advanced than in Europe, the United
States and Japan, because Taiwan has more cases of the disease," Wang said,
stressing the necessity of an organization like the TCLA.</P>
      <P>Cancer is the number one cause of death in Taiwan, with liver cancer being the
most deadly. The high mortality rate from liver cancer compared to other
countries is due to the fact that 15 to 20 percent of Taiwan people are
hepatitis B or C carriers, according to Wang.</P>

      <P>It is expected that the exchange of Chinese yuan will be permitted at specific
locations in Taiwan, including airports, harbors and financial institutions,
after the Taipei-based Central Bank of Republic of China (CBC) has implemented
the measures, in line with an election promise made by President-elect Ma Ying-
jeou of the Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Ma vowed, throughout his campaign, to build closer trade and economic ties with
China after he assumes office on May 20, promising measures such as full
convertibility of the Chinese currency in Taiwan on an incremental basis.</P>
      <P>The CBC has forecast that the demand for the exchange of the Chinese yuan and
Taiwan dollar will grow in Taiwan, as the incoming KMT administration is set to
allow the entry of Chinese tourists from early July -- up to 3,000 per day in
the initial stages and increasing to 10,000 per day eventually.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan residents are allowed to exchange Chinese yuan only on the
offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu, in amounts of less than 20,000 yuan.</P>
      <P>Kinmen and Matsu maintain direct two-way ferry services to three ports in
China's Fujian provinces, via the mini links which allow many China-based Taiwan
businessmen to travel frequently between the two sides.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) has increased the prize for its 23
millionth passenger in hopes that the lucky person would come forward, a THSRC
executive said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The THSRC has been looking for the ticket holder for about two weeks, but to
date no one has shown up to claim the prize. The number 23 million was selected
by the THSRC because it is linked to Taiwan's total population.</P>
      <P>The  23  millionth  THSRC  ticket,  bearing  the  number 11-2-01-0-103-0365, was
a non-reserved adult ticket and was bought at Tainan Station in southern Taiwan
at 11: 41 a.m. April 12 for travel to Taichung Station in central Taiwan,
according to the THSRC.</P>
      <P>The THSRC is now offering an additional prize of 23 tickets for standard trains,
valid for one year and usable at any time during its daily schedule. The
original prize was 23 tickets for business class, valued at NT$56,120
(US$1,852), and a 700T model train set valued at NT$6,000, the executive said.</P>
      <P>The THSRC began operation last January and since then has seen continuous growth
in performance. Its trains travel between Taipei and Kaohsiung in 90 minutes at
a competitive cost that has forced several domestic air carriers to discontinue
their flights on that route.</P>
      <P>The THSRC also gave prizes to its 5 millionth and 10 millionth passengers.</P>
      <P>The executive said if the 23 millionth passenger does not show up by May 22 to
claim the prize, the THSRC will donate the tickets or an equivalent sum of money
to charity.</P>

      <P>The spending for the fireworks display during the May 20 presidential
inauguration celebration in southern Taiwan will be limited to NT$5 million
(US$164,500), or one fourth of the original allocation budgeted by the
government, a spokesman for President-elect Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>John Feng, convener of Ma's inauguration celebration organizing team,  said Ma
has given  instructions  that the inauguration celebrations be held in line with
the principles of "economy and simplicity."</P>
      <P>Although the sum of NT$20 million had originally been budgeted for the fireworks
display along the Love River in the port city of Kaohsiung, Ma said that based
on his experience as two-term Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006, "there is no need
to spend that much."</P>
      <P>The budget for the fireworks display will be NT$5 million at most, and any
unused funds may be transferred to other development projects or returned to the
national coffers, Feng quoted Ma as saying.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the quality of the display  would not be compromised due to the
lower spending, Ma's staff has also decided to take a cue from the United
States' Fourth of July celebrations in Boston and have a symphony orchestra play
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture."</P>
      <P>The piece is best known for its climatic volley of cannon fire and ringing
chimes, which is expected to uplift the spectators, the staff said.</P>
      <P>Feng said he has contacted the Kaohsiung City Symphony Orchestra and the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) to discuss their roles in the fireworks
display.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City Symphony Orchestra was "elated" and "is now preparing for its
performance, " Feng said. The MND also said that the volley of cannon fire will
synchronize perfectly with the fireworks display "to create a spectacular show
worth more than NT$20 million."</P>
      <P>Feng said that the fireworks display will last 30 minutes, and all vacant areas
close to the Love Rive will be open to the public on May 20, once the
authorities give security clearance.</P>

      <P>The first bluefin tuna caught this season was sold for NT$1.73 million
(US$57,055) in an auction at Donggang harbor Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The auction, presided over by Council of Agriculture head Su Jia-chyuan and
Pintung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung, marked the beginning of the 2008 annual
Pingtung Bluefin Tuna Cultural Festival.</P>
      <P>The giant tuna fish, weighing 247 kilograms, was caught by a fishing boat named
Wan Yi Tsai which is registered with the Liouciou Islet off Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>To qualify as the first tuna caught for the season, the fish must be a northern
bluefin tuna -- a species native to both the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean.
Its weight must exceed 180 kilograms, and the fish must have been alive when it
was removed from the water.</P>
      <P>The catch must be reported immediately to the nearest fishery radio station and
must be shipped back to Donggong harbor by boat.</P>
      <P>Three restaurants bid for the fish in the auction.  Hung Shih-yang, owner of the
Hong Hai Sea Food Restaurant near the Kaohsiung International Airport, said he
was happy to win the bid for his four-month old business by offering a price of
NT$7,000 per kilogram.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung County Government has hosted the annual Bluefin Tuna Cultural
Festival since 2001, with the aim of stimulating the local economy.</P>
      <P>Owners of fishing boats operating out of Donggang used to export most of their
tuna catch to Japan, but since the county government launched the Bluefin Tuna
Cultural Festival, they now prefer to sell their fish on the domestic market for
better prices, netting a total profit of over NT$600 million per year.</P>

      <P>Following questions about the high price of its multivitamin, Centrum, the
manufacturer Wyeth Taiwan Corp. said Wednesday that it does not plan to lower
the price.</P>
      <P>According to a local newspaper Wednesday, people in Taiwan pay a much higher
price for Centrum than in other countries, although it is manufactured locally.</P>
      <P>Wyeth's Taiwan-manufactured Centrum is priced at around NT$600 (US$19.8) for 120
tablets -- NT$5 per tablet -- while Centrum made by Wyeth's parent company in
the U.S. costs only US$17.67 for 523 tablets, or NT$1.6 per tablet.</P>
      <P>In response to the report, Ye Man-qing, director of the consumer healthcare
department of Wyeth, said that the high price is a consequence of different
manufacturing processes and regulations.</P>
      <P>She indicated that Taiwan's humid climate has to be taken into consideration in
the manufacturing process, and that the multivitamin is classified as a drug
under Department of Health regulations.</P>
      <P>In order to lower the unit price, Wyeth Taiwan, which is based in Hsinchu County
in northern Taiwan, is presenting the multivitamin in packages of 310 tablets,
Ye added.</P>
      <P>"Although the U.S. dollar has depreciated, the cost of raw materials on the
international market have continued to rise, " she said. "So far, we have no

      <P>The Food Sanitation Bureau of the Department of Health (DOH) announced Wednesday
that it will present a certification system for vegetarian food in mid-May for
promulgation in July, if there are no objections from the public.</P>
      <P>The bureau's planned move is in response to a call by Kuomintang Legislator Lin
Hong-chi, who urged DOH head Hou Sheng-mao to develop a certification system to
protect the rights of Taiwan's more than 2 million vegetarians.</P>
      <P>Officials  at the Food Sanitation  Bureau said that after consulting more than
100 civic organizations, including religious groups and food production
companies, the bureau has decided to group vegetarian foods into five classes --
purely vegetarian, vegetarian with eggs, vegetarian with dairy products,
vegetarian with eggs and dairy products, and vegetarian without animal content.</P>
      <P>The system will be implemented in July if there are no objections from the
public, and law enforcement agencies will begin to impose fines for violations
with effect from July 2009, they said, adding that those who infringe on the
regulations by mislabeling their products could face fines of between NT$40,000
and NT$200,000.</P>
      <P>A package marked "purely vegetarian" means that its does not contain animal
products or any of the five spices that are considered as non-vegetarian --
onion, garlic, Chinese chives, shallot and leek -- because, according to
Buddhist scriptures, they excite the senses.</P>

      <P>The three candidates running for the chairmanship of the soon-to-be-opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will draw lots Thursday to determine the
order in which their names will appear on the ballots, party sources said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Outgoing DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh made the announcement after the party's
Central Executive Committee (CEC) approved the candidacy of the three hopefuls
-- Trong Chai, a veteran legislator,  Koo Kuang-min, a former presidential
adviser, and former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen -- for the race.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, consultations for the three hopefuls to avoid a showdown in
the vote slated for May 18 have not yet broken off.</P>
      <P>"I have met with all three candidates and have come to a fair understanding of
their views on the party chairman race, " Hsieh told reporters after a CEC
meeting.</P>
      <P>"While all three are willing to negotiate a way out, none of them are willing to
accept the proposal that two of them withdraw from the race voluntarily right
now," Hsieh said, adding that all of them agreed to take part in a policy debate
or a televised platform presentation.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the party has tentatively decided to organize a televised debate May
10 for the three candidates to present their policy visions. A changeover
ceremony for outgoing and incoming chairman will take place May 21.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that he has
talked with all three hopefuls for the party leadership and they have agreed to
debates but none of them were willing to bow out of the race.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the three -- former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen, and two other pro-
independence diehards, DPP Legislator Trong Chai and former presidential adviser
Koo Kuan-min -- have "a strong sense of mission in running for the post, and
none of them can be persuaded to quit."</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who was urged by DPP members to mediate among the hopefuls to produce one
candidate and avoid further splintering within the floundering party after its
latest setback in the March 22 presidential election, said he will follow the
party system to start the coordination process.</P>
      <P>"It will start with debates and a presentation of platforms, " Hsieh said,
adding that if this fails, then there will be a vote by party members on May 18.</P>
      <P>DPP Central Standing Committee member Wu Ping-jeo said "the result of the
election is already sealed." Although he did not elaborate, it is widely
believed that Tsai, with her clean image, has the broadest support within the
party.</P>
      <P>Wu's colleague Yang Chiu-hsin, who also serves as Kaohsiung magistrate,
supported this view, saying that "an election is unnecessary, " and that Hsieh
should start the coordination process immediately.</P>
      <P>Chai has vowed to "stick to his guns to the last."</P>
      <P>During a meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee, members also passed a
proposal to scrap the controversial DPP polls that exclude "pan-blue" voters,
meaning supporters of the soon-to-be-ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and its allies.</P>
      <P>Although the proposal will not have to be sent to a DPP provisional congress May
4 for approval, the congress could still overturn the decision if it disagrees
with the idea.</P>
      <P>The DPP's national election primaries are comprised of two parts -- a party
member vote and public opinion polls, with the vote accounting for 30 percent,
while the polls account for the remaining 70 percent. The DPP, under then-party
chairman Yu Shyi-kun, changed the format of its polls by screening out the "pan-
blue" voters in October 2006, and the new poll format has been only used once
since then -- during the DPP legislative primary in May 2007.</P>
      <P>Many within the DPP have cited the controversial poll as the main reason for the
party's drubbing in the Jan. 12 legislative elections in which the DPP garnered
only 27 seats compared to the KMT's 81 seats in the 113-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>The recent "China fever" whipped up by the ongoing visit of Chinese real estate
tycoons was also a topic at Wednesday's meeting.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he will meet with seven chiefs of local governments run by the
DPP next week to discuss the party's stance on the matter.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he favors investments by the tycoons in factory and other
manufacturing sectors, but would oppose any speculating by the Chinese in real
estate, as this would hurt the public, the wage-earners and the youths.</P>
      <P>He said  that  the DPP  will  respect  the incoming  KMT administration's
pursuit of high economic growth figures, but added that he thinks it should also
address the issues of inflation, bubble economy and over reliance on China, and
especially social justice and fair distribution of resources.</P>

    <HEADLINE>All three party head hopefuls to stay in the race: DPP chairman</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
04/24/08  12:50:17
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that he has
talked with all three hopefuls for the party leadership and they have agreed to
debates but none of them were willing to bow out of the race.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the three -- former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen, and two other pro-
independence diehards, DPP Legislator Trong Chai and former presidential adviser
Koo Kuan-min -- have "a strong sense of mission in running for the post, and
none of them can be persuaded to quit."</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who was urged by DPP members to mediate among the hopefuls to produce one
candidate and avoid further splintering within the floundering party after its
latest setback in the March 22 presidential election, said he will follow the
party system to start the coordination process.</P>
      <P>"It will start with debates and a presentation of platforms, " Hsieh said,
adding that if this fails, then there will be a vote by party members on May 18.</P>
      <P>DPP Central Standing Committee member Wu Ping-jeo said "the result of the
election is already sealed." Although he did not elaborate, it is widely
believed that Tsai, with her clean image, has the broadest support within the
party.</P>
      <P>Wu's colleague Yang Chiu-hsin, who also serves as Kaohsiung magistrate,
supported this view, saying that "an election is unnecessary, " and that Hsieh
should start the coordination process immediately.</P>
      <P>Chai has vowed to "stick to his guns to the last."</P>
      <P>During a meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee, members also passed a
proposal to scrap the controversial DPP polls that exclude "pan-blue" voters,
meaning supporters of the soon-to-be-ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and its allies.</P>
      <P>Although the proposal will not have to be sent to a DPP provisional congress May
4 for approval, the congress could still overturn the decision if it disagrees
with the idea.</P>
      <P>The DPP's national election primaries are comprised of two parts -- a party
member vote and public opinion polls, with the vote accounting for 30 percent,
while the polls account for the remaining 70 percent. The DPP, under then-party
chairman Yu Shyi-kun, changed the format of its polls by screening out the "pan-
blue" voters in October 2006, and the new poll format has been only used once
since then -- during the DPP legislative primary in May 2007.</P>
      <P>Many within the DPP have cited the controversial poll as the main reason for the
party's drubbing in the Jan. 12 legislative elections in which the DPP garnered
only 27 seats compared to the KMT's 81 seats in the 113-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>The recent "China fever" whipped up by the ongoing visit of Chinese real estate
tycoons was also a topic at Wednesday's meeting.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he will meet with seven chiefs of local governments run by the
DPP next week to discuss the party's stance on the matter.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he favors investments by the tycoons in factory and other
manufacturing sectors, but would oppose any speculating by the Chinese in real
estate, as this would hurt the public, the wage-earners and the youths.</P>
      <P>He said  that  the DPP  will  respect  the incoming  KMT administration's
pursuit of high economic growth figures, but added that he thinks it should also
address the issues of inflation, bubble economy and over reliance on China, and
especially social justice and fair distribution of resources.</P>

      <P>The Food Sanitation Bureau of the Department of Health (DOH) announced Wednesday
that it will present a certification system for vegetarian food in mid-May for
promulgation in July, if there are no objections from the public.</P>
      <P>The bureau's planned move is in response to a call by Kuomintang Legislator Lin
Hong-chi, who urged DOH head Hou Sheng-mao to develop a certification system to
protect the rights of Taiwan's more than 2 million vegetarians.</P>
      <P>Officials  at the Food Sanitation  Bureau said that after consulting more than
100 civic organizations, including religious groups and food production
companies, the bureau has decided to group vegetarian foods into five classes --
purely vegetarian, vegetarian with eggs, vegetarian with dairy products,
vegetarian with eggs and dairy products, and vegetarian without animal content.</P>
      <P>The system will be implemented in July if there are no objections from the
public, and law enforcement agencies will begin to impose fines for violations
with effect from July 2009, they said, adding that those who infringe on the
regulations by mislabeling their products could face fines of between NT$40,000
and NT$200,000.</P>
      <P>A package marked "purely vegetarian" means that its does not contain animal
products or any of the five spices that are considered as non-vegetarian --
onion, garlic, Chinese chives, shallot and leek -- because, according to
Buddhist scriptures, they excite the senses.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first bluefin tuna caught this season was sold for NT$1.73 million
(US$57,055) in an auction at Donggang harbor Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The auction, presided over by Council of Agriculture head Su Jia-chyuan and
Pintung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung, marked the beginning of the 2008 annual
Pingtung Bluefin Tuna Cultural Festival.</P>
      <P>The giant tuna fish, weighing 247 kilograms, was caught by a fishing boat named
Wan Yi Tsai which is registered with the Liouciou Islet off Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>To qualify as the first tuna caught for the season, the fish must be a northern
bluefin tuna -- a species native to both the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean.
Its weight must exceed 180 kilograms, and the fish must have been alive when it
was removed from the water.</P>
      <P>The catch must be reported immediately to the nearest fishery radio station and
must be shipped back to Donggong harbor by boat.</P>
      <P>Three restaurants bid for the fish in the auction.  Hung Shih-yang, owner of the
Hong Hai Sea Food Restaurant near the Kaohsiung International Airport, said he
was happy to win the bid for his four-month old business by offering a price of
NT$7,000 per kilogram.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung County Government has hosted the annual Bluefin Tuna Cultural
Festival since 2001, with the aim of stimulating the local economy.</P>
      <P>Owners of fishing boats operating out of Donggang used to export most of their
tuna catch to Japan, but since the county government launched the Bluefin Tuna
Cultural Festival, they now prefer to sell their fish on the domestic market for
better prices, netting a total profit of over NT$600 million per year.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has paid tribute to the Taiwanese winners of the 2008
Bakery World Cup, saying they are Taiwan's glory in an alternative way, as they
have put Taiwan on the world stage in a new field of endeavor.</P>
      <P>Chen congratulated the winners on behalf of the government and people of Taiwan
during a meeting with them at the Presidential Office Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen said the three bakers had won the prizes because of their creativity,
intelligence, efforts and persistence, and that they serve as inspiration for
other Taiwanese people seeking success.</P>
      <P>The three-member  Taiwanese  team won second place in the competition, behind
the French team and ahead of Italy which placed the third.</P>
      <P>Like Taiwan-born New York Yankees pitcher Chien-ming Wang, Taiwanese ultra-
marathon runner Lin Yi-chieh, and female tennis players Chuang Chia-jung and
Chan Yung-jan, Chen said they had made Taiwan shine in the world.</P>
      <P>The bakers, Wu Pao-chun, Tsao Chih-hsiung and Wen Shih-cheng, presented the
panel of judges with home-style bread of a special flavor. They spent eight
hours making the bread from mainly flour, dried longan and rum, and shaping them
to feature the traditional Chinese lion and dragon dance motif.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu and Tsao each won an individual prize in the European style and
artistic baking categories.</P>
      <P>The triennial competition was held in Paris from March 30-April 1, drawing a
total of 12 national teams.</P>
      <P>Chen praised Wu for striving to achieve his goals despite the fact that he grew
up in a poor family and suffered many setbacks in life. The president said that,
following Wu's example, each person can find his or her own stage and seize the
opportunity to make a name for himself or herself in the world.</P>

      <P>Sixty-percent of public libraries and museums inspected recently by the
Consumers' Foundation had at least four safety problems, including, in one case,
fire extinguishers that had expired seven years ago, according to the results of
the evaluation released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The inspection was conducted March 10-31 of 90 public libraries and museums
around Taiwan -- 19 in northern Taiwan, 23 in central Taiwan, 24 in southern
Taiwan's Tainan region, 13 in the Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas and 11 in the
eastern areas of Hualien and Taitung. A total of 14 safety criteria were
evaluated.</P>
      <P>The Juesui Township Library in Hualien County was rated as the most unsafe
library, failing in nine of the areas examined.</P>
      <P>Also at the bottom of the list were the Kaohsiung Municipal Library's Hsinhsing
branch and the Shoufeng Township Library in Hualien County, both having failed
to meet seven of the safety criteria.</P>
      <P>The Old Fort of An-Ping Museum in Tainan City, which failed six of the
foundation's safety standards, was rated as the third-most unsafe building on
the list.</P>
      <P>It was found that 40 percent of the libraries and museums inspected  were either
not equipped with any emergency escape mechanisms or had failed to make such
equipment easily identifiable.</P>
      <P>Also, 38 percent of libraries and museums failed to display emergency escape
maps on every floor, and in 19 percent of the buildings, the fire hydrants were
blocked by other objects.</P>
      <P>At 9 percent of libraries and museums, the pressure setting on the fire
extinguishers was incorrect, while at 10 percent of the buildings, the fire
extinguishers had passed their expiry date. In one case, at the Juesui Township
Library, fire extinguishers that had expired on June 1, 2001 had not been
replaced.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers blasted the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) government Thursday over the appearance of the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office Director Stephen Young at the "Yushan war games, "
saying that Taiwan's national dignity had been compromised.</P>
      <P>"Our national dignity was harmed with the appearance of the American
representative in Taiwan and officials from the U.S. State Department at the
military exercises," said KMT Legislator Lin Yu-fang after an interpellation
session held by the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National Defense
Committee.</P>
      <P>"It is extremely disturbing. I have never seen anything like that," he said.</P>
      <P>According to a China Times' report, AIT Director Stephen Young and several
officials from the U.S. State Department were invited to observe the Yushan war
games, which simulated a strike by the Chinese military on the east coast of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During Tuesday's exercise, Young and several U.S. officials arrived at the
Hengshan Command Center -- a top-secret war command and control center -- and
left with President Chen Shui-bian and other high-ranking  officials on a
military personnel carrier, simulating evacuation under attack, the report
stated. It also noted that  it  was  an  unprecedented  decision  to allow
foreign representatives to take part in national war games.</P>
      <P>The government, however, stressed that the U.S. officials "did not directly take
part in the exercise, but rather closely observed the simulated evacuation of
foreign civilians under Chinese missile fire."</P>
      <P>In response to KMT Legislator Lin's question on whether the MOFA knew in advance
that Young would be at the war games, MOFA's Deputy Minister Yang Tzu-pao said
he did not know about it beforehand as the MOFA is not in charge of the
exercise.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Mei-yu, deputy director-general of the MOFA's Department of North American
Affairs, said that she had not received any notification that.U.S. State
Department officials would be part of the military exercises.</P>
      <P>But she disclosed that in response to a MOFA inquiry, the National Security
Council had said that based on the principles of reciprocity and bilateral
cooperation, the U.S. officials were granted "limited observation" status by the
government and they did not participate in any meetings related to dealing with
national crises.</P>
      <P>Lin contended that there was no rationale for Young's presence at the military
exercise, as Taiwan is neither a vassal state nor a colony of the U.S. He also
noted that Taiwan's representative to the U.S. will never be invited to
participate in any U.S. war games.</P>
      <P>"No matter how close the two countries are, boundaries should be set when
national secrets are involved, " Lin said. He however conceded that the issue
could be viewed in the light of the U.S. highly valuing its relations with
Taiwan and wishing to have more substantial contact with high-level officials.</P>
      <P>Asked about the U.S. officials' participation in the military exercises, the AIT
on Thursday declined to comment on the matter.</P>

legally banned corporal punishment in December 2006, a Ministry of Education

students physically punished in schools dropped from 42.5 percent in 2006 to
29.2 percent in 2007, said Jenny Ko of the MOE's Student Affairs Committee. She
noted that this means 70.8 percent of students had not been physically punished
in 2007.</P>
      <P>During the first two months of 2008, the percentage of students who received
physical punishment in schools declined further to 15.8 percent, marking a
decrease of 12 percentage points compared with the 27.7 percent recorded during
the same period in 2007, Ko said.</P>
      <P>The results mean 84.2 percent of students had not been physically punished at
school during the January-February 2008 period, compared to 72.3 percent during
the same period in 2007, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>By region, Chiayi City, Changhua County and Pingtung County are the three

It is the question that has hung over Senator Barack Obama's presidential
campaign, and it loomed large on Tuesday night after his loss to Senator Hillary

      <P>Facing a tougher investment environment in China and fiercer competition
globally, Taiwanese manufacturers in mainland China need the Taiwanese and
Chinese government to work together to help them cope with the changes, said a
panel of experts Thursday.</P>
      <P>The experts were speaking at a seminar held by the Institution for National
Policy Research (INPR) to discuss the future of Taiwanese companies that are
based in China.</P>
      <P>Many of them called for local policy makers from both sides to take measures,
including helping the businesses relocate from China's coastal cities to inland
provinces where the cost of labor and production is cheaper. Experts also urged
the governments to help the businesses upgrade their operations to switch to
value-added and brand productions.</P>
      <P>The institution's president Tien Hung-mao, while addressing the seminar, and
noted that President-elect Ma Ying-joeus pledge to form closer ties with China
could create a mechanism for normalized cross-strait economic relations.</P>
      <P>The era of more open cross-strait negotiations is about to come,said Tien, a
former foreign minister of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, he cited the recent global economic slowdown and stricter China
investment regulations as major obstacles Taiwanese enterprises need to tackle.</P>
      <P>Following China's launch of a new labor contract law that favors workers and the
takeaway of tax incentives for Taiwanese investments in the coastal cities in
2007, Taiwanese businesses fear that lower profitability could force them to
relocate their businesses to Vietnam or inland China.</P>
      <P>The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, according to economists, could prolong its
negative effect on the global economy in the next year, Tien added, noting that
the international crisis is something the governments across the Taiwan Strait
must work out hand-in-hand.</P>
      <P>Experts also advised Taiwan's government to help re-position Taiwanese
businesses in the global market.</P>
      <P>Policy makers must find new roles for Taiwanese industries in China, said Wea
Chi-lin, chairman of Top Taiwan VI Venture Capital Co., adding that the cross-
strait political stalemate must not become the issue blocking bilateral economic
exchanges.  Wea said by allowing more cross-strait trade such as financial
exchanges, local government could help Taiwan to find an alternative roleVas a
logistics center for the worlds business people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  should make amendments  in regulations  governing cross-strait trade to
improve local logistics for Chinese businesses and tourists,said Wea.</P>
      <P>He added that this could also help to boost the service export sector, in which
Taiwan ranked 26 in the world, a relatively weak performance compared with its
merchandise export sector, which ranked 16.</P>
      <P>Touching on the recent visit to Taiwan by a group of wealthy property developers
and business people from China, Wea said Chinese investment in the local real
estate market at this early stage should be kept to commercial zones, instead of
residential areas.</P>
      <P>The prices for residential areas concern the welfare of the public; therefore
the investment should be taken slowly, he explained.</P>
      <P>Liu Cheng-tao, a Chinese scholar from Tsinghua University in Beijing, called for
the establishment of a cross-strait negotiation mechanism to safeguard bilateral
investment and trade, and to promote speedier transportation for high-skilled
workers so they can easily travel between the two sides.</P>
      <P>When cross-strait direct flights are established, Taiwans specialists could fly
to China in the morning and back in the evening,he added.</P>
      <P>Liu also said Taiwan's government should lift some of the bans on cross-strait
trade, and provide support to help manufacturers upgrade their operations to
raise their ability to compete.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government meanwhile could also take on further measures to protect
and boost Taiwanese business, experts said.</P>
      <P>The Beijing government should give Taiwanese companies more time to adjust to
the new regulations, said Kao Chang, a scholar of National Dong Hwa University,</P>
      <P>He was referring to the new labor contract law and the cancelling of tax
incentives, the latter of which hikes Taiwanese enterprises' income tax from the
average 12 percent to 25 percent in the coastal cities.</P>
      <P>He added that China should also improve its service efficiency to better support
the manufacturers to base and maintain their business operations in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwanese companies are worrying about the change in China sinvestment
environment,Kao said, indicating fears of a trend of potential shutdowns in
operations by Taiwanese manufacturers in the following year.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education plans to provide NT$3.7 billion (US$122 million) in
three years to help improve the reading environment at public libraries around
the country, according to a ministry official.</P>
      <P>The project to help the country's public libraries upgrade their facilities,
replenish their stocks of books and hold readings is aimed at creating a more
friendly reading environment nationwide, according to Chu Nan-hsien, director of
the ministry's Department of Social Education.</P>
      <P>"We hope children would enjoy going to libraries as much as going to
McDonald's," Chu said.</P>
      <P>Chu made the announcement Wednesday at a ceremony during which the ministry
signed an agreement with the National Central Library and representatives from
every city and county around the island to promote reading.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was held to coincide with World Book and Copyright Day, April 23,
designated by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) to encourage reading.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, representatives of various sectors of Taiwan's society also presented
the ministry with a statement expressing their hope that the country's reading
environment would be improved.</P>
      <P>To mark the day, the Taipei City Government called a news conference Wednesday
to promote a four-year reading program for students at elementary schools around
the country with the objective of helping children to develop early reading
habits.</P>
      <P>At the event, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin told a story to school children and
donated to National Education Radio a collection of selected stories created by
students, for broadcast on the station's bedtime programs.</P>
      <P>Kang Tzung-hu, deputy director of the city's Department of Education, said that
according to a survey, on average, each student in the city had read more than
30 books per year since the city government launched a reading program in 2003.</P>
      <P>The city government has been holding a series of activities, including story-
telling and reading contests, to promote reading among school children, Kang
said. The activities complement an exhibition that is being held until April 27
at the Taipei Public Library to showcase students' stories, plays, and other
types of creative writing, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic group criticized the government Thursday over what it called a misguided
policy that has resulted in 20,000 migrant workers per year waiting in Taiwan
for new jobs.</P>
      <P>The Migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT) denounced the Council of Labor
Affairs' (CLA) decision to allow the so-called "3D (dirty, dangerous, difficult)
industries" to hire workers directly from abroad.</P>
      <P>According to the MENT, since the policy was put into effect in October 2007,
about 13,600 new workers have been recruited from abroad, leaving thousands of
migrant workers already in Taiwan in financial straits.</P>
      <P>Most of these migrant workers, who live in hospices operated by the government
or non-governmental organizations, were forced to leave their original jobs
either because they were ill treated by previous employers, or the factories
they worked for were shut down, the MENT stated in a press release.</P>
      <P>If these workers,  most of whom are from Southeast Asian countries, do not find
employment within two months, they will be repatriated, according to the
statement. Some of them may run away and try to find new jobs, illegal in most
cases, before they could be sent back to their countries, as have no money to
repay their debts, it added.</P>
      <P>Most migrant workers in Taiwan start out with debts, on average, of US$7,000 to
US$8,000 in employment brokerage fees, the MENT stated.</P>
      <P>"If these workers cannot find new employers, they would have no choice but run
away or return to their home countries heavily in debt," said Wang Wen-shiou,
director of the Labor Concern Center of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, in
the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Asked in a telephone interview why Taiwan employers prefer to import new workers
rather than hire those already in Taiwan, Ku Yu-ling, chairperson of the Taiwan
International Workers' Association, explained that "brokers make more profit by
bringing in new workers from abroad than by placing those already in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"I would never be able to repay my debts if I do not find a job in Taiwan," said
a 25-year-old Vietnamese woman, who first came to Taiwan to work in a factory.
When the factory closed down, she was transferred to a Catholic center where she
is now awaiting new employment.</P>
      <P>Another Vietnamese immigrant said he was fired from his job because he refused
to work 16 hours a day for an eight-hour wage.</P>
      <P>"We are asking the CLA to change the regulations on hiring foreign workers, and
to encourage Taiwanese employers to give priority to people who are already in
the country and waiting for new jobs," Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of the Interior,  about 358,000 foreigners work in
Taiwan, most of whom are from Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The MENT is an umbrella organization of about a dozen of non-governmental
organizations nationwide that advocate migrant worker rights.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it remains "cautious
but optimistic"  over diplomatic relations with Paraguay, despite the recent
election to power of President Fernando Lugo, who is known to favor ties with
China.</P>
      <P>The diplomatic ties between Taiwan and the South American country were the focus
at Thursday's  interpellation  session  of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign
Affairs and National Defense Committee, in light of the newly elected Paraguayan
President Fernando Lugo's statement, before and after the election, that he
wants to establish closer relations with China.</P>
      <P>MOFA's Deputy Minister Yang Tzu-pao said that Lugo will have to take into
consideration the long lasting Taiwan-Paraguay friendship, as well matters such
as national development and international cooperation now that Lugo is to lead
Paraguay..</P>
      <P>"The ministry is cautious but optimistic about the bilateral relations between
Taiwan and Paraguay," Yang said, stressing that the ministry remains in close
contact with Paraguay and is optimistic that bilateral relations will remain in
place.</P>
      <P>Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop, won a historic victory in Paraguay's
presidential election, ending more than six decades of rule by the central-right
Colorado Party.</P>
      <P>After his meeting with Lugo Monday, Taiwan's ambassador to Paraguay David Hu
told the Paraguayan media that Taiwan will not mind Paraguay developing
relations with any country, as long as the diplomatic relations between Taiwan
and Paraguay are not jeopardized.</P>
      <P>Describing  "dual recognition"  of Taiwan  and China as a degradation of
bilateral relations, Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tsai Huang-liang
contended that it will be a "cul-de-sac" situation for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan-Paraguay relations will serve as barometer for relations
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"It would be a huge slap in the face for Taiwan if diplomatic ties with Paraguay
are severed after President-elect Ma Ying-jeou takes office May 20," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>"China will never allow dual recognition, " said DPP Legislator Twu Shiing-jer.
"Even if dual recognition is an option, Taiwan should try it out first with
countries with which it has no diplomatic relations," he added.</P>
      <P>In response, Yang said "I would prefer to call such links 'parallel
relationships' rather than 'double recognition, '" meaning that Taiwan is happy
to see Paraguay establish relations with other countries but hopes that such
relations will not put the existing bilateral relations between Taiwan and
Paraguay at risk.</P>
      <P>Paraguay and Taiwan forged diplomatic relations in 1957 and Paraguay is Taiwan's
only remaining diplomatic ally in South America.</P>

      <P>The discussions, known as the "Koo-Wang Talks," were held in Singapore and
Shanghai in 1993 and 1998, respectively, between Ku, then chairman of Taiwan's
semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Wang, then director of
China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The timing  of the film's  screening,  just  before  Ma's inauguration, is
widely seen as significant, as Ma has promised to improve cross-strait relations
which have been frozen since the Democratic Progress Party came to power in
2000.</P>
      <P>Koo played a "rare role" in Taiwan's history, from the time of Japanese
colonialism to cross-strait negotiations, Ma said at the the film premiere and
commemoration ceremony which was organized by the Koo Foundation.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that during the two Koo-Wang talks, the discussions focused not only on
important cross-strait issues, but also on cultural topics such as Chinese
opera, which he said had made the dialogue even more meaningful.</P>
      <P>"I hope the screening of the documentary on Koo will help give rise to more
figures (like him) in our society," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew said that considering Koo's achievements in
business, diplomacy, and cross-strait negotiations, his passing was indeed a big
loss to all Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>"Koo will live forever in the memory of people around the world," Siew said,
expressing the view that Koo had devoted his life and contributed all that he
could to the welfare of the nation.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman-designate of the SEF, pledged to follow in Koo's
footsteps and said that his work will not only impact on Taiwan's future
development but also on the welfare of all Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's national interests and the welfare of the Taiwanese people will be my
priorities," he pledged.</P>
      <P>According to Vivien Koo, Koo's eldest daughter and the producer of the
150-minute documentary, the commemorative piece portrays her father's life
through photographs, video clips, and interviews with the people with whom he
had contact, including former Singapore President Lee Kuan Yew, and former U.S.
President George H. W. Bush.</P>
      <P>She said the documentary will be broadcast from Friday to Sunday between 9:00
p.m. and 10:00 p.m. on Channel 52.</P>
      <P>Koo's widow, Cecilia, disclosed that up to the time he died he was still
worrying about Taiwan's future. With tears in her eyes, she related that Koo
kept emphasizing that "our country must never be split up."</P>
      <P>Koo, a respected leader in business circles in Taiwan and founder of Taiwan's
Economic Council offices in the United States, Japan, Korea, and most of those
in Europe, was born on Jan. 6 1917 in Taipei. He died of renal cancer on Jan 3,
2005 at the age of 87.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislators expressed strong opposition Thursday to
the outgoing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  administration's  assignment of
a new representative, an indigenous official, to Fiji less than one month before
it hands over the reins of power.</P>
      <P>Yohani  Isqaqavut,  formerly  minister  in  charge  of the Cabinet-level Council
of Indigenous Peoples, has been appointed as Taiwan's top representative in the
South Pacific nation since late March.</P>
      <P>He is the first aboriginal official to be appointed by Taiwan to serve as the
country's top representative in another nation.</P>
      <P>Yohani is poised to fill the vacancy left by Kuo Shih-nan, who was re-assigned
to Singapore as Taiwan's representative in that city state in September 2007.</P>
      <P>Yohani is reportedly scheduled to assume his post on May 5.</P>
      <P>Expressing opposition to the assignment, KMT Legislators Ting Shou-chung and
Kung Wen-chi, who is himself an aborigine, said at a session at the Legislative
Yuan's Foreign and Defense Affairs Committee that Yohani's assignment during a
governmental transition period is unacceptable to the KMT administration, which
is set to take office May 20.</P>
      <P>Ting said that since Yohani has yet to assume his post, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs should halt his assignment.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou,  from the KMT,  and the KMT administration are
slated to be inaugurated on May 20. If Yohani were to assume his new post in
Fiji on May 5, he would probably be recalled after May 20, making him a Taiwan
representative in Fiji for only 15 days, Kung said.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry had announced plans to appoint an indigenous representative
to Fiji before the presidential election and had previously said the move was
aimed at helping Taiwan strengthen ties with Pacific  Island  nations,  many of
which have aboriginal populations which share a common heritage, language and
customs with Taiwan's indigenous tribes.</P>
      <P>Kung, however, described Yohani's assignment as a joke. He said it is ridiculous
that President Chen Shui-bian appointed the first aboriginal envoy a month
before his second term is about to expire, despite having been in the office for
nearly eight years.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are many capable aboriginal talent who could be assigned
abroad to represent Taiwan, Kung added that "I hope President  Ma will  see to
it that  a more trustworthy  and representative aboriginal envoy will be
assigned abroad soon after he is inaugurated."</P>

      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) declined Thursday to say whether former
White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card would lead a U.S. delegation to attend
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration ceremony next month.</P>
      <P>Speaking with Taiwanese media, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte
said Wednesday in Washington D.C. that the U.S. government looks forward to
sending a delegation to Taiwan to attend Ma's inauguration ceremony. Local media
in Taipei reported that Card has been designated to lead the delegation.</P>
      <P>An AIT staff in Taipei told a Central News Agency reporter that "it will make an
official announcement as soon as it (the envoy) is confirmed."</P>
      <P>The status of the U.S. envoy, his relationship with the president in particular,
is often seen as an important indicator of how Washington views bilateral
relations between Taiwan and the United States. Since the U.S. reacted
positively to Ma's election, Taipei has high hopes that the Bush administration
would dispatch a high-level delegate to Ma's inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also avoided making direct comments on the
issue. Spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said at a regular press briefing that the ministry
has a general idea about the list, but due to diplomatic practices, details will
have to be announced by the U.S.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. government probably will not send administration officials for the
ceremony as there is no diplomatic relations between the two countries, " she
said. "As to who will lead the delegation, I believe the U.S. government has its
own position."</P>
      <P>The AIT is a non-profit, private corporation established shortly after the U.S.
government changed its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China on Jan. 1,
1979. The AIT Taipei office, however, functions as a de facto embassy and its
head is also treated as the de facto top U.S. representative to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Supreme Court clears President-elect of corruption charges</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou was acquitted Thursday by the Supreme Court of
charges of corruption and breach of trust related to the use of a special
allowance fund during his term as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Closing a case that had undergone two appellate proceedings, the highest-level
of Taiwan's judiciary affirmed the Taiwan High Court's ruling that Ma was not
guilty of the charges.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court said the appeal by the prosecution against the ruling was
invalid because it failed to present any argument against claims by the Taiwan
High Court that Ma had no intention of embezzling from the fund and did not
obtain the money through "fraudulent means."</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted on Feb. 13, 2007 on charges of embezzling NT$11.17 million from
a special allowance fund designated for his discretionary use during his mayoral
terms. The funds in question were set aside to cover the mayor's job-related
expenses.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor in charge of the case claimed that Ma transferred half of the
public funds to his personal bank account every month, keeping that portion
which was not used as his personal income, with the knowledge that they were
public funds.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor claimed that although the government's regulations allow the
mayor to use half of the fund by simply signing a receipt instead of providing
vouchers to account for his spending, the money should go towards job-related
spending and that any remaining funds should be returned to the government's
coffers.</P>
      <P>However, the Taipei District Court acquitted Ma of the charges on Aug. 14, 2007,
saying that half of the special allowance funds paid to executives holding
public office are meant as salary subsidies and that as soon as the payment is
made, the receivers are authorized to spend the money at their discretion,
without having to provide proof of spending.</P>
      <P>The practice is established by the Cabinet and should not be considered
"fraudulent," according to the district court's verdict.</P>
      <P>The prosecution appealed the ruling to the Taiwan High Court on Aug. 17, but the
ruling was affirmed by the high court on Dec. 28.</P>
      <P>Undeterred, the prosecution appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court on Jan. 9.</P>
      <P>While the Supreme Court maintained the high court ruling that Ma was not guilty,
it, however, expressed its disagreement with claims by the district court and
high court that half of the special allowance funds are meant as some kind of
"salary subsidies."</P>
      <P>Although no proof of spending is required, this part of the funds must also be
used on job-related expenses, according to the Supreme Court's verdict.</P>

      <P>Technical matters concerning Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists and the launch
of weekend charter flights across the Taiwan Strait will be put in place from
July 4 as planned, Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun quoted Taiwan's president-elect
Vicente Siew as saying Thursday.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks to the Japanese newspaper in an exclusive interview
Wednesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Siew was cited as saying that technical details related to the two issues have
all been settled, and that the only thing that is required now is "political
judgment."</P>
      <P>Asked why he was confident that such a step could be taken, Siew replied that he
had obtained a "visionary answer" from Chinese President Hu Jintao on April 12
during the Boao Forum for Asia 2008 in China's Hainan Province.</P>
      <P>Regarding the establishment  of direct cross-strait charter flights on weekends,
Siew said the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and the Kaohsiung
International Airport will offer the charter service in the initial stages, and
that a total of seven airports around Taiwan will be allowed to operate the
business in the future.</P>
      <P>Siew said that the Chinese side did not mention the sensitive "one-China" issue
during the forum, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Siew reiterated that Taiwan would welcome Chinese investment in large-scale
development projects over the coming eight years, which will involve NT$4
trillion (US$132 million) worth of investment funds. He also said that in line
with the decision to allow more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, it is also
necessary to allow exchange of the Chinese yuan.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou and his running mate Siew of the Kuomintang (KMT) ,
throughout their campaign, vowed to build closer trade and economic ties with
China after they assume office on May 20, promising measures such as permitting
Chinese tourists to sightsee in Taiwan, implementing direct cross-strait charter
flights and allowing full convertibility of the Chinese currency in Taiwan on an
incremental basis.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Central Bank of Republic of China has forecast that the demand
for the exchange of the Chinese yuan and Taiwan dollar will grow at home, as the
incoming KMT administration is set to allow the entry of Chinese tourists from
early July -- up to 3,000 per day in the initial stages and increasing to 10,000
per day eventually.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan residents are allowed to exchange Chinese yuan only on the
offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu, in amounts of less than 20,000 yuan.</P>
      <P>The Ma-Siew ticket gained a record high of 7.65 million votes, or 58 percent of
the total, in the March 22 presidential election, beating the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party ticket by a wide margin of 2.21 million votes.</P>

      <P>The government plans to launch a new strategy to encourage local manufacturers
to adopt "green technology" for mass production and waste recycling, in order to
reduce cost and pollution, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) officials
announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The strategy is part of an initiative -- dubbed "industrial pollution prevention
and control services" -- which has been operated by the MOEA's Industrial
Development Bureau (IDB) since 1983.</P>
      <P>The initiative has helped hundreds of local small and medium size enterprises
upgrade their technology and equipment to use less toxic materials and emit less
pollutants.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, by using green technology under the new plan, the
manufacturers will reduce both the cost of waste management and the expenditures
of energy, water, and raw materials.</P>
      <P>Yang Po-keng,  deputy  chief  of the bureau's  Sustainable Development Division,
said that the bureau has redirected this year's strategy from focusing on
individual companies to a group of core and satellite factories in an attempt to
increase efficiency.</P>
      <P>Yang said bureau staffers will first choose a core factory to help improve its
production technology and equipment, and the factory will later become a "pilot
factory" that encourages its satellite factories to establish their own eco-
friendly measures in compliance with the central factory's.</P>

      <P>In his statement, Hung said he will bow out of government service along with his
party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which lost to the KMT in the
March 22 presidential election after eight years in office.</P>
      <P>Hung said he will resign in the interest of upholding the "spirit of party
politics and defending political ethics and code of conduct."</P>
      <P>The DPP candidate, Frank Hsieh, lost the March 22 presidential election to Ma by

      <P>Two Hong Kong residents were arrested Thursday in the central city of Taichung
for smuggling heroin into Taiwan, a spokesman for the Investigation Bureau's
mobile unit in central Taiwan said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the two men from Hong Kong, identified as Wong Ming-ho and
Ren Pei-zhen, were referred to the Miaoli Prosecutors Office for prosecution.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the mobile unit received tips from abroad that two
drug "mules" from Hong Kong who swallowed a considerable amount of heroin balls
were hiding in a hotel in Taichung, waiting for instruction from their employer
to deliver the drug.</P>
      <P>Agents of the unit, supported by local military police and officers of the Coast

      <P>The law enforcement  agents searched their hotel room and discovered 140 heroin
balls wrapped in plastic, weighing 770 grams, with a street value of NT$15
million (US$495,375).</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, Wong confessed that he had smuggled heroin into
Taiwan several times by swallowing the drug wrapped in little plastic balls, but

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Deputy Mayor Wu Hsiu-kuang resigned Thursday after he was reported by a
weekly magazine to be under suspicion of having taken bribes from an arms
dealer.</P>
      <P>Mayor Hau Lung-bin gave the nod to Wu's resignation earlier in the day, saying
that he respects the decision.</P>
      <P>Hau said he believes Wu is "not a greedy man" and that so far, he has not been
found to have done anything illegal during his stint as deputy mayor of Taiwan's
capital.</P>
      <P>"Now that the media seem to have judged him unfavorably, Wu will probably have
to clear his name via the judicial process, " the mayor added.</P>
      <P>Confirming his resignation at a news conference, Wu denied any wrongdoing in
taking "research fees" from an arms dealing company known by its Chinese name as
Lai Fu Trading Co. for research that he did for the company between July 2005
and June 2006, when he was a professor teaching at a university in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu said, he decided to step down from the deputy mayorship as
media reports -- following a Wednesday report by Next Magazine run by the
tabloid Apple Daily -- have already damaged his reputation and tarnished the
image of the Taipei city government.</P>
      <P>"TV reports following the Next Magazine report have not only blurred the truth
but are also poised to affect the operations of the city government," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu said he was a professor at Shih Hsin University between August 2004 and July
2006 and that he did a research project for Lai Fu between July 2005 and June
2006, receiving a little more than NT$1 million (US$33,000) for his work that
took less than one year.</P>
      <P>Wu said the research he did for Lai Fu was related to his own field of research
but had nothing to do with city government affairs, since he was not working in
public office between July 2005 and June 2006.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Chia-ching, a Taipei city councilor of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , went to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office
Thursday to accuse Wu of having received bribes from an arms dealer.</P>
      <P>Hsu accused Wu of "having continuously taken bribes from Lai Fu since November
2004" and asked prosecutors to launch a probe into the case.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, the DPP caucus in the Taipei City Council demanded that Wu be
suspended from his job temporarily and that he explain himself to society to
clear up doubts about the graft allegations.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Wu has "probably violated" the "revolving door act" regulating
public functionaries, the DPP caucus members said he should be investigated by
the judiciary.</P>
      <P>Lai Fu Trading Co. is believed to be the largest and oldest arms dealer in
Taiwan. It is also carrying out work on the construction of the Taipei MRT Neihu
Line as a subcontractor, among other projects.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Committee for the Suao-Hualien
expressway will meet Friday, but regardless of any conclusion reached at the
meeting, the fate of the controversial  expressway  will  be in the hands  of
the new administration, the National Expressway Engineering Bureau (NEEB) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The NEEB, which is responsible for the construction of the proposed expressway
on Taiwan's east coast, admitted Thursday that "the meeting is just a legal
procedure and will not deprive the new government of its right to make any
decisions on the matter."</P>
      <P>The EIA committee is scheduled to be convened Friday, probably for the last time
before the opposition KMT assumes power May 20. During the last review meeting
in early April, Chang Ching-sen, vice chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development and one of the official EIA committee members, abruptly
suggested that a final decision on the plan should be left to the new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The NEEB explained later that Chang was acting on his own and had not received
any orders from the Executive Yuan to change the policy.</P>
      <P>Trying to downplay the controversy over the expressway, the NEEB said in a
statement that if the construction plan is passed, it will take about three or
four months to amend the project in accordance with the changes of budget and
members' suggestions before sending it to the Executive Yuan for final approval,
so the new government's right to make a final decision will remain intact.</P>
      <P>"For us, the worst case scenario would be having to supply more documentation, "
said Chen Ze-ren, chief of the planning section of the NEEB, adding that an EIA
report on the expressway was passed in 2000 and that the report to be reviewed
Friday is only a differences analysis.</P>
      <P>Asked about Friday's meeting, members of the committee declined to express their
opinions before the outcome.</P>
      <P>"Whether or not the plan is passed tomorrow, what really matters is the attitude
of the new government and the new minister of the Environmental Protection
Administration," said Li Han-lin, one of the heads of a student association that
is against the expressway.</P>
      <P>The 86-km expressway is designed to boost the economy of the eastern part of the
island, one of the country's poorest regions. It was one of the campaign
promises of President Chen Shui-bian in 2000. Approved in 2002 by the Executive
Yuan, it was suspended in 2003 over environmental concerns.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists say the construction, estimated to take about 10 years to
complete, is not the best solution to improving the region's immediate
transportation needs.</P>
      <P>They also say the construction will have a negative impact on the ecology of the
area and might be dangerous because of its proximity to geological fault lines.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) will subsidize remote schools in building
swimming pools to teach students how to swim and to reduce the disparity in
educational resources between urban and rural areas, an education official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Public junior high and elementary schools that have over 2,000 students and have
a suitable space for building a swimming pool may submit their applications to
the ministry before April 30 for subsidies up to NT$8 million (US$263,168), the
official said.</P>
      <P>The subsidy program started last year, and the MOE has provided assistance to 10
schools including those in offshore Lienchiang County, as well as Taipei,
Taoyuan and Miaoli counties in northern Taiwan, said the official at the MOE's
Department of Physical Education.</P>
      <P>The official said the difference in the number of swimming pools in urban and
rural areas exemplifies the uneven allocation of educational resources in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>No junior high school in eastern Taiwan's Taitung County, northern Taiwan's
Miaoli County and the offshore Penghu County has a swimming pool, according to a
study conducted in 2005. On the other hand, there were 33 swimming pools in
Taipei City's junior high schools, of which, 28 were indoor heated ones.</P>
      <P>The statistics were compiled by the National Taiwan Normal University's Physical
Education Research and Development Center.</P>
      <P>As for elementary schools, a study by the university in the same year found that
there was no swimming pool in elementary schools in Hsinchu County in northern
Taiwan, Yunlin and Chiayi counties in southern Taiwan, and offshore Penghu and
Kinmen counties. Meanwhile, there were 47 swimming pools in Taipei City's
elementary schools, of which, 33 were indoor heated.</P>
      <P>The number of swimming pools in Taipei City's elementary schools is about 40
percent of the total number of Taiwan's elementary schools, the official said,
adding that some schools have already received subsidies.</P>
      <P>One of the schools that have received the financial assistance, Luofu Elementary
School, located in Taoyuan County's Fuhsing township will have its new swimming
pool completed by the end of this year, the school's principal Bayes Lohsin
said.</P>
      <P>The township has no swimming pools, and the school's students, mostly
aborigines, would play with water in brooks or streams, which is dangerous since
they never had the opportunity to learn to swim, Bayes said.</P>
      <P>He added that when the swimming pool is completed, not only students, but also
township residents, will be able to benefit from the facility.</P>

      <P>One of the legacies of the late Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo
Chen-fu is the so-called "92 Consensus" he is purported to have forged, but the
existence of any such consensus remains controversial in Taiwanese society,
according to a documentary released Thursday in commemoration of Koo and his
achievements.</P>
      <P>The definition of the so-called "92 Consensus" -- that "there is only one China
with different interpretations as to the meaning of one China" -- is discussed
in depth in the commemorative piece produced by the Koo Foundation on the
politicians involved in the talks between Koo and his Chinese counterpart, Wang
Daohan of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The discussions were held in Singapore and Shanghai in 1993 and 1998,
respectively.</P>
      <P>According to the documentary, the conclusion of a meeting held in Hong Kong in
October 1992 prior to the first Koo-Wang talks was defined as the "92 Consensus"
by Su Chi, a former chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and a former
Kuomintang legislator who has been widely tipped to take the position of
secretary-general of the National Security Council after President-elect Ma
Ying-jeou takes office May 20.</P>
      <P>However, former President Lee Teng-hui says in an interview portrayed in the
film that "this is a consensus without a real consensus... China wants us to
accept one China."</P>
      <P>"There is no `one China, '" Lee says, adding that "one is the People's Republic
of China, and ours is the Republic China."</P>
      <P>Shi Hwei-yow, then-secretary-general of the SEF, who participated in the Hong
Kong meeting, also says in the film that no conclusion was reached at the Hong
Kong meeting and that the "one China, different interpretations" idea was in
fact dreamed up by the media.</P>
      <P>The discrepancy between China and Taiwan on the meaning of "one China" later led
to different interpretations by each side "which was accepted by China," said
Shi.</P>
      <P>Ma, a former vice chairman of the MAC also says in the documentary that "there
is no need to further negotiate on how to interpret `one China.'"</P>
      <P>The documentary, portraying Koo's life through photographs, video clips and
interviews with the people with whom he had contact, including former Singapore
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, will be
broadcast from Friday to Sunday between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Enzyme related to liver cancer discovered</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwanese biologists have reported in a recent scientific paper that
an enzyme that exists in both humans and rodents is closely related to the
development of liver cancer,  indicating a new pathway for drug and therapy
development, academic sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Activity of the enzyme -- glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) -- might also
provide an explanation to why females have a lower incidence of liver cancer, or
hepatocellular carcinoma, while the risk among males is sometimes three to eight
times higher.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-ming, a professor at the Department of Microbiology of National Yang-
Ming University, said that their study found that the expression of GNMT-related
genes is suppressed in patients with liver cancer, indicating that the cancer is
prone to develop when the enzyme and related genes fail to function normally.</P>
      <P>Chen also noted that the GNMT-related gene expression is also found to be eight
times stronger in females than in males, suggesting that males are more
susceptible to liver cancer.</P>
      <P>The findings have already been proved in experiments on rodents and published by
medical journal Hepatology late last year. Another study published by the
journal in its April issue reconfirms the correlation between the enzyme and
liver cancer development.</P>
      <P>During animal testing, the team used GNMT-knockout mice as subjects and found
that at 11 weeks after birth, the mice developed syndromes  of  hepatomegaly
and  hypermethioninemia,  and  had significantly higher levels of both serum
alanine aminotransferase and hepatic S- adenosylmethionine -- all of which can
lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.</P>
      <P>The tests also found that 100 percent of the female mice without GNMT develop
liver cancer, while the onset ratio is only 50 percent among male GNMT- knockout
mice.</P>
      <P>Chen said the figures suggest that GNMT does inhibit cancer development and
indicate that females without GNMT protection are more susceptible to liver
cancer.</P>

      <P>The results of a recent survey on youth policy conducted by the Cabinet-level
National Youth Commission (NYC) reveal that most of the youths surveyed would
prefer to have no after-school cram studies, the NYC reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The issue was chosen by the country's youths in an online poll authorized by the
NYC in a bid to tap the thinking of the younger generation, their likes and
dislikes.</P>
      <P>The youths' choice of "no more after-school cramming" as their favorite policy
indicates that the younger generation crave more leisure and relaxation time in
addition to the time they spend studying, NYC officials said.</P>
      <P>"My future is not just a dream" was another issue chosen as the No. 2 concern of
the youths who responded to the survey, according to NYC officials.</P>
      <P>Officials from the NYC, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Education
and the Cabinet-level Department of Health, as well as several civic groups
championing youths rights and interests, met for a seminar recently aimed at
gaining deeper understanding of young people so as to work out a more pragmatic
youth policy.</P>
      <P>Twenty issues were available in the survey for the youths to list in order of
importance, with sex and relationship issues also close to the head of the list,
the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan industry leaders urge cooperation between cross-strait firms</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's industry leaders Thursday called for closer cooperation between
Taiwan's and China's technological and financial sectors, urging them to follow
in the footsteps of manufacturing-based industries.</P>
      <P>Leaders of Taiwan's industries were speaking at a one-day seminar held by the
Institution for National Policy Research (INPR) , where they discussed the
choices Taiwanese companies based in China have in face of a slowdown of major
economies around the world and a potential strengthening of ties across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>They called on Taiwan's government to take the initiative to relax current
regulations on cross-strait trade, while urging the Beijing government  to help
Taiwanese companies maintain their business operations in China.</P>
      <P>"The restrictions  will only handicap China-based Taiwanese industries and slow
their development, " said Preston W. Chen, chairman of the Chinese National
Federation of Industries (CNFI), who added that cross-strait industry
collaboration is "inevitable."</P>
      <P>Chen urged Taiwan's incoming administration to remove the 40 percent investment
cap that restricts most companies from expanding investment in China.</P>
      <P>"Investing in China does not mean selling our motherland, " he said, adding that
he is confident that money earned in China would return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Both sides' industries could work hand-in-hand to form stronger economic
entities, Chen said, adding that local governments must not fight against the
trend of integration among companies across the strait.</P>
      <P>Chen added that more and more Taiwanese investment are upgrading into
technology-concentrated sectors instead of labor-intensive, low-end
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Schive Chi, a Shin Hsin University professor who is regarded as a potential
cabinet  member in the incoming  administration  of President-elect Ma Ying-
jeou, echoed Chen by saying a win-win situation will be achieved at the
establishment of cross-strait direct sea and air links.</P>
      <P>"The speedier transportation will help build Taiwan as an Asia- Pacific Regional
Operations Center that focuses on Taiwan's location advantage, manufacturing
strength and rich cultural assets, " he explained.</P>
      <P>Schive also said Taiwan, by being the more financially developed side, could
become a regional financial center in the Asia Pacific.</P>
      <P>This corresponded with what was said earlier in the seminar by the other
panelists, who stressed closer financial cooperation might help form a shield
for Taiwan and China to weather the current U.S. subprime mortgage crisis that
has clamped global finance.</P>
      <P>Chou Wu-tien, the chairman of the Taipei Foundation of Finance, encouraged
Taiwanese investors to explore the Chinese market for financial services.</P>
      <P>"By establishing cooperation between stock exchanges and opening bilateral
investment in banking businesses, both sides could together form a healthier
mechanism safeguarding  investment  and money transactions," Chou said.</P>
      <P>He added that the Chinese government should also return the favor by giving
Taiwan industries credit for helping it to become more modernized in the finance
sector,  while putting forward more incentives to attract Taiwanese investment.</P>
      <P>Chang Bin-shi, the chief representative of Polaris Securities in Shanghai, said
through setting up bank branches bilaterally, cross- strait financial markets
could be integrated to create more financial services, such as capital financing
across the strait.</P>
      <P>"To integrate in a steady and gradual pace, these financial institutions could
take the first step by holding seminars and forums to gain mutual
understanding," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Merger of two major KTV chains fails due to FTC opposition</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) rejected again Thursday a planned merger of the
two largest KTV chains in Taiwan, out of concern that the merger would damage
the market competition mechanism.</P>
      <P>The FTC imposed the ruling after the Holiday KTV and Cashbox KTV filed an appeal
with the Executive Yuan's Petition and Appeals Committee against an earlier FTC
ruling in 2007 prohibiting the two from merging with each other based on the
reason that the combination would lead to a monopoly.</P>
      <P>In February this year, the petition committee came up with a ruling that revoked
the FTC's 2007 ruling and instructed the FTC to review the case once again.</P>
      <P>In 2003, the two KTV operators filed the merger plan, which would have allowed
the businesses to hold a joint market share of 41 percent at that time.</P>
      <P>The FTC agreed to the merger, but with a proviso that banned the two from
blocking emerging competitors through sheer market scale.</P>
      <P>However, the merger did not go forward because they failed to reach an agreement
on cooperation and the two operators withdrew the project in 2004.</P>
      <P>Two years later, Holiday and Cashbox re-submitted the merger plan after settling
the disagreement, but this time they failed to win the FTC's approval, which
reasoned that the two businesses' combined market share had increased since
their first merger attempt.</P>
      <P>Holiday and Cashbox together not only control over half of the KTV service
market in Taiwan, their combined market share has reached 90 percent in Taipei,
the FTC said in its ruling against the merger last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>620,000 poor people to benefit from government rice program</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>At least 620,000 underprivileged people will benefit from a government charity
program aimed at giving rice to the poor to help them cope with rising food
prices, government officials in charge of the program said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Minister  of the Interior  Lee Yi-yang and Huang Yu-tsai, director-general of
the Agriculture and Food Agency under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA), made the announcement at a news conference held at the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>In line with an instruction issued last month by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and a
decision by an Executive Yuan product price stabilization task force, the MOI
and the COA will launch the program that will run May 1-15, using government-
stored rice, Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the program will target low income families, poor elderly
people, disadvantaged women and mentally challenged citizens, with the combined
number of eligible people estimated at more than 620,000.</P>
      <P>Each member in the low-income families included in the program will be entitled
to receive 10 kg of free rice, while members of medium-low-income families will
receive 5 kg.</P>
      <P>As much as 8,427 metric tons of rice will be distributed if two such charity
operations are conducted this year, with the other distribution program slated
for the end of this year, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Non-profit welfare organizations, including Fokuangshan Temple and World Vision
Taiwan, as well as city and county authorities, will join the efforts to
transport the grain to local residents in need, he noted, adding that
transportation fees will be shared by central and local governments.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the rice to be given away is from the newly harvested crop
which has been quarantined within the last year.</P>
      <P>Compared to the government's stockpiles of about 308,000 metric tons of rice,
the amount to be used for the charity program is just a small portion, he said.</P>
      <P>The government has always maintained a safe level of rice stocks -- some 310,000
tons at present -- to provide a buffer against shortages or emergencies.</P>
      <P>Compared to other Asian countries, however, Taiwan's rice prices have remained
relatively stable, having increased by only 13 percent this year, Huang said
last week at a legislative committee meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Public's IT competitiveness above average: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The  international  information competitiveness of people in Taiwan is
considered by many locals to be just above average, according to the results of
a poll released Thursday.</P>
      <P>Sixty eight was the average score given by 1,083 poll respondents on local
people's computer competitiveness on a 100 point scale, the results show.</P>
      <P>The respondents were aged over 20 and had at least a junior high school
education.</P>
      <P>At a press conference organized by the poll commissioner, Business Weekly, a
major business magazine in Taiwan, Microsoft Taiwan Corp. General Manager David
Tsai described the score as " not surprising."</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is a major producer of computer hardware, people's ability to
use software and their creativity are the keys to competitiveness, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Taiwan does less well on software than it does on hardware, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>In addition, the poll shows a disparity in the computer skills of different age
groups, with nearly 90 percent of the respondents in their 20s saying they know
how to use computers but only 53 percent of the respondents in their 50s
describing themselves as computer literate and 47 percent in the same age group
saying they do not have computer skills.</P>
      <P>In the age group of 60 and above, a mere 28 percent said they know how to use
computers, the poll results show.</P>
      <P>In general, 30 percent of the respondents who have received basic compulsory
education were found to lack computer skills, which indicates a huge digital
gap.</P>
      <P>To bridge the gap, Ho Fei-peng, chief CEO of PC home Publication Group,
suggested at the press conference that computer classes, already offered by many
schools, should be made compulsory.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lu Hsi-peng, a professor at National Taiwan University of Science
and Technology's Department of Information Management,  said that computer
skills  determine  a person's competitiveness in the job market and called on
young people to enhance their information abilities.</P>
      <P>The poll also discovered that respondents with higher academic degrees are more
likely to feel that women are less computer literate than men, while 35 percent
of the women polled said that females do not know how to use computers, a view
expressed by only 25 percent of the male respondents.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An academic who warned of a property bubble in Taipei in a letter to a newspaper
editor April 12 has received a threatening letter telling him to "shut up" or a
contract killer will be sent to murder him.</P>
      <P>The Wenshan police station in Taipei confirmed Thursday that its officers were
investigating the intimidation case.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-oh, a professor of land economics at National Chengchi University,
warned property hunters in his letter to the editor that the property market in
Taipei is showing signs of a bubble and that although the market is no longer
flourishing, housing prices are still being maintained at abnormally high
levels.</P>
      <P>After the letter was published, Chang received a computer-printed letter from
the "Greater China Real Estate Alliance," warning him to keep his mouth shut or
his life will be in danger.</P>
      <P>Chang told reporters that the caution he set forth in his letter to the editor
was well-intentioned, as he felt he has a duty to share the findings of his
research with the public.</P>
      <P>He added that 38 percent of the property prices offered on the Taipei market are
bubble prices, although they have not yet reached bursting point.</P>
      <P>"People should be careful when trying to buy property and the banks should avoid
over-extending credit when granting mortgages," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Benson Liao, president of Evertrust Rehouse Co., said that while there is a
price bubble problem with presold housing units in Taipei, the property market
in Taiwan otherwise appears normal.</P>
      <P>Liao agreed that the abnormally high prices of presold housing units will have
an impact on the overall property market because they tend to make buyers of
second-hand houses believe that the prices they paid were relatively cheap while
in actual fact the prices had already been jacked up.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian congratulated Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo
by telephone Thursday on his historic election victory and invited him to visit
Taiwan at his convenience, according to a Presidential Office statement.</P>
      <P>Lugo's victory made him the first opposition figure to capture Paraguay's
presidency in more than six decades.</P>
      <P>In their phone conversations, Chen lauded the Paraguayan people for their
maturity in greeting their country's first transition of power between different
political parties in more than 60 years with calm rationality, the Presidential
Office statement said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and Paraguay have forged diplomatic ties for 51 years, Chen
said both countries have benefited from their long-term cooperative projects in
various fields.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to further reinforcing bilateral exchanges and cooperation with
the incoming Paraguayan government, " Chen said, adding that the two countries
should begin negotiations on an expanded framework for future cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chen, who will step down May 20 after ending his two four-year terms, told Lugo
that he will continue assisting in boosting friendship between the two countries
after his retirement.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop, expressed his gratitude for
Taiwan's long-term financial aid and technological assistance to his country. He
also expressed hopes that the two countries will further strengthen their
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Paraguay is Taiwan's sole remaining diplomatic ally in South America. As Lugo
had said during his presidential campaign that he would like to establish ties
with China if he won the election, speculations have been rife in recent days
that the longstanding Taiwan-Paraguayan  official ties may be at stake after
Lugo's inauguration later this year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Tzu-pao said at a
Legislative Yuan committee meeting earlier in the day that the ministry is
"cautious but optimistic" about relations with Paraguay, stressing that the
ministry has remained in close and extensive contact with various Paraguay
quarters and will do its best to maintain bilateral ties.</P>

      <P>According to Huang, the rice to be given away is from the newly harvested crop
which has been quarantined within the last year.</P>
      <P>Compared to the government's stockpiles of about 308,000 metric tons of rice,
the amount to be used for the charity program is just a small portion, he said.</P>
      <P>The government has always maintained a safe level of rice stocks -- some 310,000
tons at present -- to provide a buffer against shortages or emergencies.</P>
      <P>Compared to other Asian countries, however, Taiwan's rice prices have remained
relatively stable, having increased by only 13 percent this year, Huang said
last week at a legislative committee meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Scholar threatened for warning of housing bubble in Taipei</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An academic who warned of a property bubble in Taipei in a letter to a newspaper
editor April 12 has received a threatening letter telling him to "shut up" or a
contract killer will be sent to murder him.</P>
      <P>The Wenshan police station in Taipei confirmed Thursday that its officers were
investigating the intimidation case.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-oh, a professor of land economics at National Chengchi University,
warned property hunters in his letter to the editor that the property market in
Taipei is showing signs of a bubble and that although the market is no longer
flourishing, housing prices are still being maintained at abnormally high
levels.</P>
      <P>After the letter was published, Chang received a computer-printed letter from
the "Greater China Real Estate Alliance," warning him to keep his mouth shut or
his life will be in danger.</P>
      <P>Chang told reporters that the caution he set forth in his letter to the editor
was well-intentioned, as he felt he has a duty to share the findings of his
research with the public.</P>
      <P>He added that 38 percent of the property prices offered on the Taipei market are
bubble prices, although they have not yet reached bursting point.</P>
      <P>"People should be careful when trying to buy property and the banks should avoid
over-extending credit when granting mortgages," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Benson Liao, president of Evertrust Rehouse Co., said that while there is a
price bubble problem with presold housing units in Taipei, the property market
in Taiwan otherwise appears normal.</P>
      <P>Liao agreed that the abnormally high prices of presold housing units will have
an impact on the overall property market because they tend to make buyers of
second-hand houses believe that the prices they paid were relatively cheap while
in actual fact the prices had already been jacked up.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian congratulated Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo
by telephone Thursday on his historic election victory and invited him to visit
Taiwan at his convenience, according to a Presidential Office statement.</P>
      <P>Lugo's victory made him the first opposition figure to capture Paraguay's
presidency in more than six decades.</P>
      <P>In their phone conversations, Chen lauded the Paraguayan people for their
maturity in greeting their country's first transition of power between different
political parties in more than 60 years with calm rationality, the Presidential
Office statement said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and Paraguay have forged diplomatic ties for 51 years, Chen
said both countries have benefited from their long-term cooperative projects in
various fields.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to further reinforcing bilateral exchanges and cooperation with
the incoming Paraguayan government, " Chen said, adding that the two countries
should begin negotiations on an expanded framework for future cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chen, who will step down May 20 after ending his two four-year terms, told Lugo
that he will continue assisting in boosting friendship between the two countries
after his retirement.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop, expressed his gratitude for
Taiwan's long-term financial aid and technological assistance to his country. He
also expressed hopes that the two countries will further strengthen their
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Paraguay is Taiwan's sole remaining diplomatic ally in South America. As Lugo
had said during his presidential campaign that he would like to establish ties
with China if he won the election, speculations have been rife in recent days
that the longstanding Taiwan-Paraguayan  official ties may be at stake after
Lugo's inauguration later this year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Tzu-pao said at a
Legislative Yuan committee meeting earlier in the day that the ministry is
"cautious but optimistic" about relations with Paraguay, stressing that the
ministry has remained in close and extensive contact with various Paraguay
quarters and will do its best to maintain bilateral ties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng expressed welcome Friday to the notion
that U.S. President George W. Bush might send former White House Chief of Staff
Andrew Card to attend President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's May 20 inauguration
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Wang said that if unconfirmed local media speculation that Card has been
assigned to lead a U.S. delegation to attend Ma's inaugural ceremony proves to
be true, it would indicate that Bush attaches great significance to the matter
and that Ma's taking the helm of Taiwan is highly acceptable to the United
States.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that the U.S. has not previously sent anyone of higher status
than Card to Taiwan for official functions," Wang said, adding that "although
Card is retired, it is widely known that he has maintained very close ties with
Bush."</P>
      <P>"Card's delegation to Taiwan would indicate that the Bush administration is
highly positive toward Ma's election, particularly after both Taiwan and the
U.S. have squandered years in the work of consolidating bilateral relations,"
Wang said.</P>
      <P>"I'm sure the U.S. will keenly expect Taiwan's new government to show goodwill
so as to help improve U.S.-Taiwan relations," he added.</P>
      <P>Barbara J. Schrage, managing director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
, declined a day earlier to confirm who will be appointed to lead the U.S.
delegation to Taiwan for the presidential inauguration,  adding that the AIT
will not make an official announcement until the envoy is confirmed.</P>
      <P>The AIT is a non-profit, private corporation established shortly after the U.S.
government shifted its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China Jan. 1, 1979.
The AIT Taipei office, however, functions as a de facto embassy and its head is
also treated as the de facto top U.S. representative to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislation is needed to solve once and for all controversy involving government
officials' use of special allowance funds, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang echoed remarks made by State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming a
day earlier calling for the Legislative Yuan to amend relevant statutes so that
the use of special allowance funds can be regulated more clearly and
efficiently.</P>
      <P>"Only by enacting legislation can the issue be addressed once and for all on a
comprehensive basis," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang called for the country not to waste any more time and resources on an issue
that is part and parcel of the history of the Republic of China government.</P>
      <P>Chen and Wang made the calls after President-elect Ma Ying-jeou was acquitted
Thursday by the Supreme Court of charges of corruption and breach of trust
related to his use of a special allowance fund during his term as Taipei mayor
from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Closing a case that had undergone two appellate proceedings, the highest-level
of Taiwan's judiciary upheld a Taiwan High Court ruling that Ma was not guilty
of the charges.</P>
      <P>"Basically, the judges believe that this case was the result of human error by
Ma's secretary and had nothing to do with Ma, " said Chang Chun-tsung, a
spokesman for the Supreme Court's Criminal Department, upon the final court
ruling announcement.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court said an appeal by the prosecution against the ruling was
invalid because it failed to present any argument against claims by the Taiwan
High Court that Ma had no intention of embezzling from the fund and did not
obtain the money through "fraudulent means."</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13, 2007 on charges of embezzling NT$11.17 million  from  a
special  allowance  fund designated  for his discretionary use during his
mayoral terms. The funds in question were set aside to cover the mayor's job-
related expenses.</P>
      <P>While the Supreme Court upheld the High Court ruling, it expressed its
disagreement with claims by the District Court and High Court that half of the
special allowance funds are meant to be some kind of "salary subsidy."</P>
      <P>Although no proof of spending is required, this portion of the funds must also
be used only for job-related expenses, according to the Supreme Court verdict.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu Thursday offered to donate books and two computers to
a kindergarten in Taiwan's outlying Lanyu, or Orchid Island, to provide better
educational resources to the island's children.</P>
      <P>Lan An Kindergarten -- the island's only preschool, was a stop on a visit by Lu
to the island.</P>
      <P>Lu was making her third visit to Lanyu to acquire a better understanding of the
island's development and its problems related to a shortage of resources.</P>
      <P>The island, lying 45 km off the coast of the eastern county of Taitung, is home
to the Tao aboriginal tribe. About 90 percent of the island's more-than 3,000
residents are Tao.</P>
      <P>The tribe has an oceanic culture and is well-known for its flying fish festival
in the spring, its unique houses of stone and wood, and the wooden boats used by
the Tao for fishing and transport.</P>
      <P>Lu visited a Tao boatyard, traditional Tao houses and a cultural museum,
accompanied by Lanyu township office personnel.</P>
      <P>In addition to discussing education, she also exchanged views about the
township's development in terms of medical facilities, basic infrastructure and
cultural conservation with the township office staff.</P>
      <P>The visit could be Lu's last during her tenure, which will come to an end when
opposition Kuomintang President-elect Ma Ying-jeou is inaugurated May 20.</P>
      <P>She asked Lanyu residents to continue to pass their thoughts about township
affairs and their needs to the Taitung county government and aboriginal
legislators in order to let the central government hear their voices.</P>
      <P>She also encouraged local residents to create more dishes or products with
flying fish, the island's specialty, to make the area's produce more widely
known.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she expressed hope that the "Blue Highway" -- a project that promotes
marine transport along Taiwan's coastline and outlying islands -- will have its
route extend to Lanyu this September under a new government push to boost local
tourism.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Labor Standards  Act Friday that
raises the mandatory retirement age from 60 to 65.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Yang Chiung-ying, a lead sponsor of the
bill, said the amendment is aimed at protecting the work rights of elderly
workers in light of the fact that the average life expectancy in Taiwan has
increased to 76, with more older workers staying in the labor force rather than
retiring.</P>
      <P>Expected to benefit immediately from the amendment are workers aged between 60
and 65, who presently number approximately 94,000, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, there are approximately 30,000 workers aged above 65 in the labor
force, Yang added.</P>
      <P>On claims by critics that the amendment will mainly benefit elderly workers in
state-owned enterprises, Yang said such claims are unfair because state-owned
enterprise workers aged over 60 are usually allowed to continue working as long
as they obtain the approval of the relevant authorities.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, elderly workers in private businesses are those most
in need of protection, she said, adding that those who wish to retire early can
still do so voluntarily.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 350,000 baby Asian horseshoe crabs bred in captivity were released into the
wild off Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen Friday in an effort to conserve the
"living fossil" species.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Deputy Magistrate Yang Chung-chuan led over 200 Kinmen residents
and students in the activity held on the shore of the Chienkung islet and the
mouth of the Wuchiang creek under the guidance of officials from the Kinmen
Aquaculture Research Institute (KARI), which bred the crabs.</P>
      <P>According to KARI researchers, the horseshoe crab is nearly extinct in waters
surrounding Taiwan proper but is occasionally seen near the Penghu Island group
and on the west coast of Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>The seas around Kinmen are among the horseshoe crab's major natural habitats,
but even there, its numbers have declined in recent years as a result of
industrial  and urban development,  the researchers said.</P>
      <P>The sharp dwindling of the crab population prompted KARI to zone an 800-hectare
coastal area near Kuningtou as Kinmen's horseshoe crab conservation district in
1999 in the hope that its population could be preserved.</P>
      <P>In addition, since 2006 KARI has staged annual releases of baby horseshoe crabs
to help accelerate the natural replenshiment of the species, known as a "living
fossil" because it has evolved little in its 400 million years of existence.</P>
      <P>With a distinctive domed carapace shaped like a horseshoe and a stiff pointed
tail,  the Asian horseshoe crab, or "tachypleus tridentatus, " is known as one
of Taiwan's few "living fossil" species.</P>

      <P>Taiwan, in concert with more than 100 other countries, kicked off a series of
community improvement activities in support of Global Youth Service Day (GYSD)
Friday, an annual international event that mobilizes young people to meet the
needs of their communities through volunteerism.</P>
      <P>This year, the event organizer for the local activities -- the National Youth
Commission (NYC) -- has devised a number of events under the theme of "Young
Volunteers Love the Globe, " in an attempt to promote awareness of issues
related to global climate change, according to a NYC spokesman.</P>
      <P>GYSD, launched in 1988 in the United States, mobilizes young people in more than
100 countries worldwide in service projects for a three-day run every April.</P>
      <P>The 2008 GYSD, which will run through April 27, involves millions of young
people who will address important community issues through service and service-
learning projects. The goal of the event is to call on young people to change
the world and build better lives for all.</P>
      <P>As part of Taiwan's  GYSD activities,  the National Youth Commission plans to
solicit 500 ideas and projects from the country's young people that could help
deter global warming, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The ideas and projects will be shared at a G8 work camp slated to be held in
August in Hokkaido, Japan, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the commission's central, Nantou and eastern branches also rolled out
various community service projects, while the Overseas Compatriot Affairs
Commission, the Ministry of Education, and a number of volunteer  and youth
groups  have also been participating in related GYSD activities, the spokesman

      <P>3M Taiwan, one of the oldest foreign companies in Taiwan, will continue to
invest in the island so as to grow along with the country's economic progress,
the head of the company said Friday.</P>
      <P>3M, a multi-faceted technology company that produces more than 55,000 products,
is based in St. Paul, Minnesota and has been in Taiwan for over 39 years. It
will be celebrating its 40th founding anniversary next year, said 3M Taiwan
President Chao Tai-sheng.</P>
      <P>Chao made the remarks at a ceremony held at the Taipei County Government
Building marking the opening of the 2008 3M Innovation Day in Northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A diversified technology company which boasts that over half of the world's
population use or come into contact with 3M products everyday, 3M -- with more
than 55,000 products, 30-plus core technologies --  continues to provide
innovative and practical solutions to meet the people's needs, said Chao.</P>
      <P>At the exhibition for 3M Innovation Day, research and application achievements

invited to exchange views with 3M staff on the company's eight business groups,
including: tape and automotive; abrasives and chemicals; electro and
telecommunications; health care; traffic and safety; office markets; imaging
systems; and consumer markets.</P>
      <P>Also addressing the opening ceremony, Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei said
the Taipei County Government's management and operation concepts are in line
with those of 3M in terms of environmental protection.</P>
      <P>After years of strenuous efforts, Chou said, Taipei County now ranked first
place in all cities and counties in Taiwan in efforts to prevent air and water
pollution.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the quality of the water in Danshui River is now the
cleanest it has ever been in three decades.</P>
      <P>"In the future, Taipei County will collaborate with 3M Taiwan and other
corporations to jointly build Taipei County into a metropolis of culture,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government held an award ceremony Friday as part of a series of events to
mark World Intellectual Property Day, which an economics official said reflected
Taiwan's commitment to improve both intellectual property protection and its
capacity to innovate.</P>
      <P>"Despite not being a member state of the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) , Taiwan has shown its determination to protect IP rights in
recent years, " said Vice Economics Minister Fadah Hsieh.</P>
      <P>To raise awareness of Saturday's World IP Day, the Intellectual Property Office
(IPO) under the MOEA has collaborated with private institutions to hold a series
of activities, including an essay competition, a drawing competition and a film
festival between April 10 to May 30 to promote the importance of intellectual
property (IP) rights.</P>
      <P>Friday's award ceremony honored 10 of the office's 300 inspectors who were
considered the best at examining patent and IP applications, and also awarded
prizes to dozens of children who won the bureau's drawing competition.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the ceremony and a forum coinciding with the ceremony were held to
recognize the contributions of the inspectors to intellectual property rights
protection.</P>
      <P>"The MOEA's campaigns echo what the WIPO wants to achieve throughout  the world,
" asserted Hsieh,  who also said that intellectual property was an essential
component of Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Between 2001 and 2005, Taiwan ranked third in the world in the number of
innovative patents registered, averaging 242 per million people, lagging only
behind the U.S. and Japan, according to the Council of Economic Planning and
Development.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan  focuses on innovation,  research  and intellectual development to
spearhead our technology sector and integrate our economic and social
capacities," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Evolving from a labor-intensive to a knowledge-based economy is the only way to
enter the new millennium and cope with globalization, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He cited MOEA programs to help with patent management, finance small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) , and sponsor industry innovation  and  personal
innovators,  as helping  with  this transformation.</P>
      <P>These all showed Taiwan's determination to play a role in the global trend of IP
protection, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Office director Wang Mei-hua stressed that innovation and IP protection were
necessary to develop a knowledge-based economy.</P>
      <P>"The possession of intellectual property is a key indicator of industrial
capacity, regardless of whether it's in conventional or high-tech sectors, "
Wang said, noting that innovative technologies help create boost corporate
profitability.</P>
      <P>She said the bureau needs to deal with about 80,000 patent and IP applications
per year, but has only 300 inspectors to evaluate them, an indication of the
inspectors' heavy workload.</P>
      <P>April 26 was chosen to mark World Intellectual Property Day because it
commemmorates the creation of the Convention Establishing the World Intellectual
Property Organization, which took effect on April 26, 1970.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Friday that she believed President-elect Ma Ying-
jeou deserved to be acquitted of corruption charges stemming from the use of his
special allowance fund and hoped the same standard would be applied to all
officials facing similar suspicions.</P>
      <P>Lu, who has also been indicted for abuse of the discretionary fund during her
tenure as vice president, said she thought Ma deserved the acquittal because the
system was a "common burden of history."</P>
      <P>"All cases related to the special allowance funds should be dealt with under the
same standard instead of manipulating legal terms, " the outgoing vice president
said.</P>
      <P>She made the remarks  after  delivering  a speech  at an international forum for
"International Images and Cultural Diplomacy of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lu contended that the special allowance system was created by the Kuomintang
(KMT) during the 1950s and has been passed on to the DPP government, which
simply complied with standard practices.</P>
      <P>"Our staff was told by accounting  sections  in different governmental
departments to 'just do exactly the same as what they (previous administration)
did before,'" she said.</P>
      <P>Lu criticized judicial agencies for applying selective standards and holding
only the DPP responsible for using special allowances.</P>
      <P>"How come the Special Investigative Unit only targeted the four of us while it
has so many (special allowance) cases to deal with," Lu said, referring to
President Chen Shui-bian, Presidential Secretary General Chen Tan-sun, former
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and herself.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Supreme Court upheld Thursday a high court ruling that acquitted
President-elect Ma of corruption charge.  The latest acquittal was final, as
prosecutors have exhausted opportunities to appeal.</P>
      <P>The ruling came less than a month before Ma takes office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Ma of the opposition KMT was first indicted in February 2007 for allegedly
diverting NT$11.18 million (US$372,666) from his special allowance fund into his
private account while serving as Taipei mayor between 1998 and 2006.</P>
      <P>"The KMT, which is to take office again, should solve this historical common
burden once and for all, " Lu said with a bit of emotion.</P>
      <P>Asked how about whether the president should pardon those who have been indicted
for alleged special allowance abuses, Lu said not to ask her for comment on the
issue.</P>
      <P>"As President-elect Ma has been acquitted, he should know how to handle the case
as a national leader and as a person who knows the law well," she said.</P>

      <P>Red light timers will be appearing at more intersections in Taipei City in the
months ahead as the municipal government has decided to expand the scope of
their use on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>Chen  Hsu-hsien,  head  of  the  municipal  Department  of Transportation's
Traffic Engineering Office, said Friday that the countdown timers will be
installed at 75 selected intersections around the city by August of this year.</P>
      <P>The timers will be installed at intersections where the road width exceeds 20
meters, the red light signal's duration is over 60 seconds, and where a high
number of traffic accidents occur, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The transportation department installed red light timers at five intersections
in the city last September, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>She said that as the number of traffic accidents dropped measurably in the
months following their introduction, the department has decided to expand the
scope of the timers' use on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>Green light timers on pedestrian traffic light signals have been used in Taipei
City for a number of years.</P>
      <P>But surveys by the transportation department shows that green light timers have
not received a positive response in all the counties and cities around Taiwan
where they have been introduced, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The green light turns yellow when the timer stops, indicating the pedestrians
and motorists to hurry up, but people on the cross street ofter go once the
timer stops, ignoring the yellow light.</P>
      <P>Red light timers, on the other hand, have proven "relatively less controversial"
as well as effective in cutting the number of traffic problems, because when the
timer stops at zero, the light will turn green and the pedestrians and motorists
stopped on the cross street know they can cross.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) encouraged  Taiwan  citizens  Friday  to
apply for electronic certificates to facilitate online personal income tax
filing and other government services.</P>
      <P>Citizens over the age of 18 can apply for the certificates at local household
registration offices, an MOI official said, adding that they would be required
to show their national ID cards and pay a service fee of NT$275.</P>
      <P>The application process takes only 10 minutes, and the digital certificate
would allow Internet access from anywhere to the government's round-the-clock
electronic service, according to an official at the MOI's Information Center.
The service includes annual personal income tax filing, which will begin May 1,
the official said.</P>
      <P>The digital certificate serves as "Internet ID" for people using online
government services, ensures safe data transmission, offers the convenience of
an online ID check, and allows for more efficient service, the official said.</P>
      <P>The MOI issued 1.31 million digital certificates in the period from April 30,
2003 to April 23, 2008, which accounts for 15 percent of the 9 million people
over 18 years who are frequent Internet users, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The number of applications increased from 9,365 in 2003 to more than 115,000 in
2007, and the number of personal income tax filings through the use of the
certificate increased from 1,122 in 2003 to 431,000 in 2007, the official said.</P>
      <P>The MOI is hoping more people will apply for the digital certificate and that it
will be more heavily used, as it is an important link to the electronic
government service, the official added.</P>
      <P>In support  of the  MOI's  objective,  the  National  Tax Administration of
Northern Taiwan Province will hold a lottery June 17, in which citizens who file
their personal income tax statements via the Internet using digital certificates
will qualify for the draw. The first prize is a car valued at NT$500,000
(US$16,485).</P>
      <P>Taiwan government agencies now provide 1,455 online services that may be
accessed using the Citizen Digital Certificate. The most frequently used online
services are labor insurance applications, which account for 39 percent usage,
land administration, 29 percent, immigration information, 12 percent, and tax
filing, 6 percent.</P>
      <P>Citizens can apply for the digital certificates at household registration
offices, as well as at the MOI's Information Center from 8: 30 a.m.-7: 30 p.m.
on weekdays and from 9: 00 a.m.-5: 00 p.m. on weekends.</P>
      <P>There is no charge for applications to extend the validity of digital
certificates that are about to expire, the MOI official said.</P>

      <P>Visitor arrivals to Taiwan are expected to reach 4 million this year and rise to
4.25 million in 2009 thanks to several international sports events that will
take place in Taiwan, according to a report released Friday by the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The arrivals are likely to bring in NT$180 billion to NT$192.1 billion in
revenue to the country, the report said.</P>
      <P>In 2007, visitor arrivals reached a record high of 3.72 million, the report
noted.</P>
      <P>Of the number, 1.65 million visitors said the purpose of their visit was
tourism, an increase of 89.49 percent compared with the 870,000 recorded in
2000, the report said.</P>
      <P>The CEPD attributed the increase in visitor arrivals to the government's efforts
to enhance visitor convenienc, such as setting up 80 tourist information service
stations at major transportation points and establishing a travel information
Web site that is available in both traditional and simplified Chinese
characters, English, Japanese, Korean and German.</P>
      <P>A 24-hour travel information hot line has also been launched, and can handle
inquiries in Mandarin, English, Japanese and Korean, the report said.</P>
      <P>To coincide with the 2008 Olympic Games being held in Beijing, the 2009 World
Games to be held in Kaohsiung, and the 2009 Deaftlympics to be held in Taipei,
the government is promoting Tour Taiwan Years 2008-2009 to boost tourism, the
report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA pondering whether to include depression as occupational disease</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) official said Friday that it needs to conduct
more studies and discussions on whether depression can be included on the list
of occupational diseases which are covered by Taiwan's workers compensation
system.</P>
      <P>Wu Hung-hsiang, a session chief of CLA, made the remarks while meeting a group
of labor representatives who went to the CLA office to protest against the CLA's
excluding depression as one of the occupational diseases on its new list.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the CLA added 21 diseases, including 18 types of cancer, onto a new
list of occupational diseases which will be covered by the agency's compensation
system for laborers.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsiao-ling, secretary-general of Taiwan Association for Victims of
Occupational Injuries (TAVOI), who led the representatives to the CLA, said
while the review of the occupational disease list has been overdue for 12 years,
depression should not have been excluded.</P>
      <P>"We are sorry to know that the CLA still excludes depression on its new list of
occupation disease given the fact that the occurrence of depression is quite
common in the workplace nowadays, " Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Among the protesters was Chen Chao-lien, a former female worker of the Unitech
Printed Circuit Board Corp., who said she began suffering from depression after
being downgraded in her job without explanation and verbally insulted by her
superintendents.</P>
      <P>As her complaints were ignored by the company's management, Chen said she fell
into chronic depression over the years, and was sent to the hospital twice for
treatment of mental illness.</P>
      <P>Now, in addition to losing her job, Chen said she cannot handle her daily life
and often think of committing suicide. Chen's disease still has not been
classified as an occupational disease and therefore she cannot receive any
compensation from the insurance company.</P>
      <P>As many cases of depression nowadays stem from the workplace, Huang said, the
CLA should include mental disease on its list of occupational  diseases  as soon
as possible to better protect employees' rights.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a major step toward legislative reform, the Legislative Yuan passed a law
amendment Friday which requires the recording and videotaping of consultations
and negotiations among legislative caucuses of political parties.</P>
      <P>The amended Law Governing the Legislative Yuan's Power stipulates that inter-
party legislative consultations will be recorded, videotaped, and publicized on
legislative gazette. The conclusions or agreements reached during negotiations
should also be made public according to the amendment.</P>
      <P>If the conclusions reached following consultations are starkly different from
the original proposed version of a bill, then the legislators or party caucuses
can have their proposed version and their reason for putting forward the
proposals be also printed also on the gazette.</P>
      <P>The amended law will go into effect after the president promulgates it.</P>
      <P>Under the amended law, consultation periods for controversial bills will also be
shortened from the current four months to only one month to facilitate
legislative efficiency.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ting Shou-chung of the Kuomintang who initiated the amendment, said
that after the consultation process becomes "open and transparent," the public
will know "the stance of every legislator clearly," and criticism about "under
table dealings" will end.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tien Chiu-chin of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said the
public will now be able to "join" legislators in the legislative proceedings,
which she said will "help build a more mature civic society."</P>
      <P>Ting noted that currently the public is kept in the dark about the process of
inter-party consultations and they can only see the results of the consultations
after they are put on the legislative bulletin.</P>
      <P>Due to the "secret" nature of the present inter-party consultations, the public
could also question if there is any "under the table dealings" or "interest
swapping" during the consultation process, Ting said.</P>
      <P>"This is why the inter-party consultations have to be out in the open,
especially because the new legislature has been streamlined by half to 113 seats
and a few legislators could decide the fate of a bill that involves tens of
billions of dollar," he added.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said that the legislature will act
according to the amended law passed Friday, although he said the impact is still
uncertain.</P>
      <P>However, Wang disagreed that the current style of consultations as being
"secret," saying that at least two representatives from each party's caucus are
allowed to be present, and legislators and their aides can join freely. Only the
media are "shut out of them."</P>
      <P>A legislative watchdog group welcomed the increased transparency, saying that
"the first ray of sunshine has come out."</P>
      <P>Ku Chung-hua, president of the Citizen Congress Watch, expressed the hope that
the legislature will also act quickly to allow live broadcast of legislative
proceedings.</P>
      <P>"The lawmakers should realize that they are themselves to be monitored, and that
they should not turn the legislature into a closed-door meeting," Ku added.</P>

(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A renowned Australian chef on Friday urged people to eat local, seasonal and
organic food as a way to save the environment since they are grown and produced
using environmental -friendly methods and, unlike imported food, cause no
greenhouse gas emissions with little transportation required.</P>
      <P>"I really believe in organic food and I believe strongly in the environment, "
said Curtis Stone, a famous chef from Melbourne, Australia and host of the
television cooking show "Take Home Chef."</P>
      <P>Stone said that it is good for the environment to eat organic food because they
are grown without the use of pesticides or artificial fertilizers, which are
harmful. Organic products also are healthier and taste better, he said.</P>
      <P>"When you eat with the seasons, it becomes quite a celebration. Different
seasons have different types of food that you can enjoy. It's exciting, " the 33
-year-old celebrity chef said, wearing his noted bloomy smile.</P>
      <P>A big fan of outdoor life and a keen surfer, the environmental protection
activist said that eating seasonal food is also a way of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions as people would eat less imported food, which cause a great amount of
carbon dioxide emission during transportation.</P>
      <P>On a five-day visit to promote the latest season of his cooking program on
Discovery's Travel &amp; Living channel, Stone said he paid a visit to afamous
night market in Taipei upon his arrival on Thursday night and tried the
notorious "stinky tofu" and other bizarre local delicacies.</P>
      <P>"The smell of stinky tofu did put me off a little bit but I came to like it
after I tasted it," he said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he eats pretty much everything, the heartthrob food connoisseur
said he particularly liked the glutinous rice balls filled with peanut powder
and deep fried chicken with basil.</P>
      <P>Chosen as one of People Magazine's Sexiest Men Alive, along with George Clooney
and Brad Pitt, Stone revealed his secret on how to impress girls by cooking.</P>
      <P>"When you cook for someone special, all you need to do is to get their favorite
ingredients and you have to treat them really simply," he said philosophically.
"The less you do to the food, the less chance that something will go wrong. Less
is more."</P>
      <P>As a chef, Stone said, he would like everybody to know that cooking is not only
easy, but also fun.</P>
      <P>"I try to encourage people to spend more time at the dinner table. I think if
you are confident in the kitchen then you can bring happiness to the dinner
table," he said.</P>
      <P>Stone started studying for a Bachelor of Business degree, but quit half-way
through when he realized his heart was in food instead. He began his cooking
career at the tender age of 18 at the Savoy Hotel and worked at some top
Australian restaurants before becoming head chef at the famous Marco's Quo Vadis
in London.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President praises Keelung River flood control project</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lauded the successful flood prevention project along
the Keelung River in northern Taiwan as one of the achievements of his
government during an inspection tour of the project Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen's visit to the Yuanshantze flood diversion tunnel was part of the
government's emergency preparation efforts against possible flooding as the
typhoon season -- May to November -- approaches.</P>
      <P>The Yuanshantze flood diversion tunnel, located in Taipei County's Jueifang
township, was completed in 2005 at cost of NT$6 billion (US$198 million). It
channels water from the Keeling River, as it rises, to the sea and thus prevents
flooding, which was a serious problem along the course of the river, especially
in Taipei County's Sijhih and Jueifang townships and neighboring Keelung City.</P>
      <P>Water Resources Agency Director-General Chen Shen-hsien said the project has the
passed the test of several typhoons and heavy rainfall and is a good example of
river flood control in Taiwan. The two million people living close to the river
can now be assured that their homes are safe from flooding, he added.</P>
      <P>"Time and facts have proved the success of the Keelung River flood control
project, and this was achieved by the current government," President Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president said that unlike the ineffective measures, such as raising the
river embankment and widening the watercourses, that were attempted by the
previous Kuomintang government, the flood diversion tunnel has been effective
and has allayed people's fear of flooding.</P>
      <P>It was President Chen's seventh inspection of the Keelung River and his fifth of
the flood diversion tunnel project, as his tenure nears its end. President-elect
Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Kuomintang is slated to take office May 20.</P>
      <P>In June 2006, the central government launched an eight-year program, with a
budget of NT$116 billion (US$3.83 billion) , to resolve problems of flooding in
areas that were prone to such disasters, Chen Shen-hsien noted.</P>
      <P>The flood prevention project will continue and the government will build
entertainment facilities along the Keelung River as flooding is no longer a
problem, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An environmental review panel decided Friday  to reject an environmental  impact
assessment  of the controversial  Suao-Hualien  Freeway  done  by  a Ministry
of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) agency, in effect leaving it up to
the incoming Kuomintang (KMT) government to decide the issue.</P>
      <P>The  Environmental  Protection  Administration's  (EPA's) environmental review
panel gave conditional approval to the project in March, pending a report by the
MOTC agency responsible for planning the freeway.</P>
      <P>But members of the EPA's Environmental Impact Assessment Review Committee were
clearly unhappy that the agency, the National Expressway Engineering Bureau
(NEEB), did not clarify in its report many controversial issues, such as the
project's potential impact on indigenous peoples' villages and culture and on
the area's groundwater.</P>
      <P>The members also questioned the necessity of the freeway, saying it was designed
10 years ago and may no longer be suitable to meet the real needs of those who
would use it.</P>
      <P>Others on the panel argued that the NT$93 billion plan could conflict with the
"Eastern Taiwan Sustainable Development Plan" approved in March 2008 by the
Council for Economic Planning and Development under the outgoing Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration.</P>
      <P>According to the sustainable development plan, the Suhua Freeway is neither the
only nor the best solution for eastern Taiwan's transportation problems.</P>
      <P>"Since the government's policy is not clear, I suggest that the committee reject
the report and send it back to the MOTC, " said committee member Lin Su-zhen, a
professor in the Department of Environmental Engineering of National Cheng Kung
University in Tainan, at the end of the meeting.</P>
      <P>Her suggestion was accepted without opposition by the panel's other members.</P>
      <P>It will now be up to the administration of president-elect Ma Ying-jeou to
determine the freeway's fate.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Huang Tai-hua, one of the representatives of
environmentalists quoted Chen Tain-jy, the chairman-designate of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, as saying that "he will make a policy on top
priority" and decide if the expressway should be constructed.</P>
      <P>Designed to boost the economy in eastern Taiwan, the 86-kilometer expressway,
which would be heavily composed of tunnels and bridges, would connect Suao in
the northeastern county of Yilan and Jian, just south of Hualien city, the
capital of Hualien County, to the south.</P>
      <P>At present, the only road connecting the two cities in eastern Taiwan separated
by mountainous terrain is a two-lane windy roadway cut into the side of
mountains that is frequently plagued by landslides and considered dangerous.</P>
      <P>Some living in the less-developed eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung, argue
that the roadway effectively keeps away potential tourists from the densely
populated western half of the island.</P>
      <P>They see the proposed freeway as spurring potential growth in their counties in
the same way that the 12.9-kilometer-long Hsuehshan Tunnel has boosted tourism
and the property market in northeastern Yilan County, a proposition dismissed by
environmentalists who oppose to the Suhua expressway plan.</P>
      <P>They argue that more environmentally friendly alternative means of
transportation can be arranged to spur tourism and that an influx of polluting
cars would harm the pristine natural beauty that is among the counties' main
selling points.</P>
      <P>The expressway bureau's environmental impact assessment report has been
discussed since 1999. It was approved in 2002 by the Executive Yuan,  but was
suspended in 2003 over environmental concerns.</P>

      <P>Together, the doctor and his former patient produced beautiful melodies in a

      <P>The heart-warming scene was part of the celebrations that took place at National
Taiwan University Hospital Friday to mark the 40th anniversary of its first
organ transplant -- the first living-related renal transplant in both Taiwan and
Asia by a team of four NTU doctors in 1968.</P>
      <P>Tsai Meng-kun, a doctor at the NTU Hospital's Department of Surgery, said he had
not played the violin for 20 years. But for the this special occasion, he and
music worker Gao Pei-ling, a kidney recipient, had practiced together over the

transplant experiments, using mice and other animals, while he was a medical

which are typically used to soften finished PVC products and increase their
flexibility.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials noted that concerns exist over the potential negative effects
of plasticizers on the human reproductive system and the functioning of hormones
in the body.</P>
      <P>They reminded parents that the health of their children could be affected if
they put the PVC dolls containing plasticizers into their mouths.</P>
      <P>The PVC dolls, which have been sold as merchandise or used by convenience stores
as giveaways to boost sales, have experienced growing popularity around Taiwan

      <P>The mayor of Taipei said Friday that the city is ready to accommodate 3,000
Chinese tourists per day, referring to plans by the incoming Kuomintang
government to open Taiwan to more visitors  from China and to introduce  direct
cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with foreign journalists based in Taipei, Mayor Hau Lung-bin
expressed high hopes of economic benefits from an expected influx of Chinese
tourists as well as from visitors to the 2010 Taipei International Gardening and
Horticulture Exposition.</P>
      <P>"The city is expecting that direct flights between Taipei Songshan Airport and
Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport will get off the ground to provide
quicker transportation for tourists and business people across the strait, " Hau
said.</P>
      <P>He made reference to President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's commitment to allow direct
cross-strait flights and to initially permit the entry of 3,000 Chinese tourists
to Taiwan daily, and increase that number over time to 10,000.</P>
      <P>Hau said that with direct flights, the travel time from Taipei to Shanghai will
be cut to 80 minutes from the present four hours, which includes a transfer in
either Hong Kong or Jeju, South Korea.</P>
      <P>The mayor said the Taipei City Government has already taken steps to provide
services to the anticipated influx of Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>Hau also said that the world famous international flower expo to be hosted by
Taipei in 2010 is expected to attract six million domestic visitors and 300,000
foreign tourists over a six-month period.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether a recent visit to Taiwan by potential real estate
investors from China would push up housing prices in Taipei, Hau said that the
Chinese tycoons had expressed an interest in commercial real estate rather than
residential properties.</P>
      <P>Hau also dismissed the idea that housing properties in Taipei are be overpriced.</P>
      <P>"Compared to Hong Kong and Shanghai, Taipei's housing prices are actually under-
valued," he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taipei has a rich cultural and historical heritage, he stressed that
attracting Chinese tourists and investors is not just about making money, but
also involves cultural and artistic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Hau was upbeat about Taiwan participating in the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010,
saying he will visit Shanghai to discuss the matter with the organizers of the
exposition.</P>
      <P>He also expressed a willingness to visit Hong Kong and other Chinese cities, but
said he has no concrete plans to do so at the moment.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether the city zoo is ready house two giant pandas to be
donated by the Chinese authorities, Hau said the animals will receive the
highest quality care as they will be accommodated in an NT$300 million panda
house at the zoo and 17 panda experts will be on hand to help care for them.</P>

      <P>The Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital in Dalin Township in the southern Taiwan
County of Chiayi will set up a sleep center in May to provide inter-departmental
clinical services to patients with sleep disorders.</P>
      <P>The hospital's management said Friday the plan to set up the sleep center became
necessary because an increasing number of patients -- averaging about 200 per
month -- with sleep problems were confused about which department of the
hospital they should seek medical help from.</P>
      <P>Feng Shih-ching, director of the Department of Neurology, said the causes of
sleep disorders are complicated,  and that his department and other departments,
including the Department of Psychiatry and the Department of Pulmonary Medicine,
were all involved in treating patients who have trouble sleeping.</P>
      <P>Feng said the factors that could contribute to sleep disorders include obesity,
frequent urination during the night,  sexual hypoactivity,  snoring,
uncontrollable  hypertension,  daytime sleepiness, addiction to alcohol,
difficulty of concentration, the weakening  of memory,  personality  change,
anxiety  and easy irritability.</P>
      <P>He said people with sleep disorders should seek help from doctors as soon as
possible, and that the new sleep center at Tzu Chi Hospital's Dalin branch will
group medical experts from more than 10 departments to treat patients.</P>

      <P>Energy authorities launched a program Friday to encourage local governments to
promote environment-friendly solar energy in "sunlight communities" under their
administration.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, solar-power driven generators will be installed within a certain
district to supply electricity to nearly buildings or public facilities,
according to a statement released Friday by the Bureau of Energy.</P>
      <P>The governments  are entitled  to a subsidy of NT$300,000 (US$9,880) for each
kilowatt peak (kWp) of power produced by the generators. A kilowatt peak is the
output power achieved by a solar panel under full solar radiation.</P>
      <P>The statement  said the power-generating  facility's  total installed capacity
should reach 40 kWp, and that the generator should at least cover the need of 15
buildings or 120 households.</P>
      <P>A 1 kWp solar system is said to produce 750 kilowatt-hours to 1,600 kwh per year
depending on the climate and solar conversion factors.</P>
      <P>The program is being launched at a time when Taiwan may soon face increases in
electricity prices because of soaring international raw material costs and is
trying to develop viable alternatives to fossil-fuel based power generation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Following  the rejection  of the environmental  impact  assessment  report  on
the  Suao-Hualien expressway, various groups have been expressing a range of
views on the decision to effectively leave the matter up to the incoming
Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>"The rejection of the project (by an environmental review panel) was really
unexpected, " said Tsai Zhong-yue, a leader of one of the Hualien student groups
that have been actively opposed to the project for years.</P>
      <P>"We are happy about the decision, even though it did not totally focus on the
environmental impact," he added.</P>
      <P>The environmental review panel members rejected the construction plan due to
several unresolved controversial issues, including the lack of a clear
government policy on the development of eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Our efforts have paid off, " said Lisin.haluwey, another student association
leader who is of indigenous heritage. She said that her group will continue to
pay close attention to developments on the issue.</P>
      <P>But the Hualien County Council expressed disappointment over the decision,
saying that the residents of the county will not be pleased.</P>
      <P>"The expressway is necessary, in every way, for the people living in Hualien, "
said Chen Tai-zhou, a member of the Hualien County Council, who had made a brief
speech in favor of the plan during the review meeting.</P>
      <P>"I think that the people will react strongly (to the decision)," he said, adding
that proponents of the project will discuss in few days how to respond.</P>
      <P>As the environmental impact assessment of the expressway designed to connect
Suao and Hualien, eastern Taiwan was being reviewed Friday, many Hualien County
residents came out to show their support for the project, while an estimated 200
students, each carrying a lily, traveled by train early from Hualien to Taipei
and staged a guitar concert outside the meeting to demonstrate their concerns
over the plan.</P>
      <P>About two dozen Hualien County councilors also gathered some supporters outside
the building of the Environmental Protection Administration, where they cried
out for Hualien residents to be given a safe transportation option with the
construction of the expressway.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan protests Greenpeace shipboard check</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
04/25/08  22:56:50
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) issued a statement Friday that
condemned Greenpeace activists for boarding a Taiwanese fishing boat in the
South Pacific earlier this week to check for alleged illegal catch.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the Pingtung-based 98-ton "Niensheng No. 3" was on
the open seas north of the Solomon Islands April 21 when Greenpeace  activists
interrupted its operations,  using a 2,000-ton vessel equipped with a
helicopter.</P>
      <P>The Greenpeace activists, after circling the Taiwanese ship for nearly an hour
aboard a yacht, demanded permission to board to check whether there was any
illegal shark fin harvest or excessive tuna fishing.</P>
      <P>"The Ninensheng skipper had no choice but to accede to the request by the
Greenpeace activists," the statement said, adding that although the activists
did not find any evidence of irregularities after a thorough inspection that
included photographing,  they continued to trail the Taiwanese ship for six to
seven hours after they returned to their own yacht.</P>
      <P>The activists did not stop the chase until after the Taiwanese ship entered the
Solomon Islands' exclusive economic zone.</P>
      <P>According to the International Marine Law, when a vessel is operating on the
open seas, it is under the jurisdiction of the country with which it registered
or the country to which its skipper belongs.</P>
      <P>As the Niensheng No. 3 was fishing on the open seas, the statement  said,  its
skipper could have legally rejected the Greenpeace activists' demand for
shipboard inspection, inquiry or law enforcement.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Niensheng No. 3 is high on the list of vessels permitted to
fish in the region by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission
(WCPFC) and the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), the statement argued
that Greenpeace activists' forced shipboard check, without the Taiwan
government's approval, was in stark violation of Taiwan's legal jurisdiction and
the International Law.</P>
      <P>"We strongly protest the Greenpeace activists' action, " the statement read.</P>
      <P>The incident marked the first time that a Taiwanese fishing vessel fell victim
to Greenpeace's forced shipboard inspections on the open seas.</P>
      <P>Fishery officials urged that Taiwanese deep-sea fishing vessels to immediately
ask relevant government agencies to assist in grappling with the issues if they
encounter a similar situation in the future.</P>
      <P>The Niensheng No.3 left Taiwan Jan. 16 for operations in waters near the Solomon
Islands which has issued a license to allow the ship to fish for tuna, sailfish
and shark.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Yilan County government has decided to allow free entry to the Dongshan
River Water Park from May 1 to July 11 in an attempt to attract visitors to the
county.</P>
      <P>County government officials acknowledged Friday that the park, which attracted
more than 1 million visitors each year from its inception in 1994 to 2004, has
seen declining numbers in the past three years, probably because its facilities
are no longer fresh and appealing.</P>
      <P>The water park was selected as the venue of the annual Yilan International
Collegiate Invitational Regatta between 1996 and 2005, and the annual Yilan
International Children's Folklore and Folkgame Festival for 12 years between
1995 and 2006. Both events were terminated mainly because the county government
could no longer afford the financial losses.</P>
      <P>With the summer tourism season approaching, the county government decided to
waive all entry fees -- NT$80 per adult, NT$60 per child, and NT$40 per senior
citizen -- for 72 days from May 1.</P>
      <P>Visitors, however, are still required to pay parking fees for their vehicles --
NT$100 each for buses, NT$50 for cars and NT$20 for motorcycles.</P>
      <P>The Dongshan River Water Park opened to the public in 1994, with "water
intimacy" as its theme. The park contains a boating area, a paddling area and a
family area.</P>
      <P>The main facilities in the park include an outdoor theater, paddling pools, a
museum with exhibits of dragon boats, a swimming pool and a gym.</P>

04/25/08  23:03:32
(By Emerson T. Lim and T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A weather observation station, established by Taiwan and the Philippines, was
inaugurated in the Filipino province of Rizal Thursday to help both countries
better predict typhoons  and enhance the accuracy  of weather forecasts.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the weather station in the province 20 kilometers east of
Manila is the result of one of two bilateral projects between Taiwan's National
Science Council (NSC) and the Philippines' Department of Science and Technology
(DOST).</P>
      <P>Taiwan donated US$170,000 last November to fund the research projects, which are
focused on weather disaster prevention and rainfall analysis technology.</P>
      <P>The weather station will collect data on typhoons and general climatic
information by releasing high-altitude weather balloons tied to a radio
monitoring device on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>The balloon and monitoring device cost a combined NT$14,500 (US$477) and cannot
be reused. The device will send data back to the station's computers for
analysis, and the data can then be sent to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>NSC chief  Chen Chien-jen  said after presiding  over the inauguration ceremony
that the device can gather data on wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and
ambient humidity.</P>
      <P>The data, he said, would result in more accurate prediction of the formation and
the paths of typhoons, and could help safeguard the lives and property of people
in both countries.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan and the Philippines, which do not have official ties,
will increase the training and exchange of personnel, and share satellite
weather data.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to the Philippines Wu Hsin-hsing, who was also present
at the ceremony, said that the two countries are geographically close and that
many typhoons that hit Taiwan are formed off the coast of the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The bilateral cooperation will expand the forecasting scope of Taiwan's central
weather bureau to include its neighbor to the south, Wu continued.</P>
      <P>The envoy also said he hopes that both sides can strengthen technological
collaboration in other fields, which he believed will be conducive to bilateral
relations.</P>
      <P>For his part, DOST Secretary Estrella Alabastro said at the ceremony he hopes
that Taiwan and the Philippines can maintain a long-term technological
collaboration.</P>
      <P>Antonio Basilio, Taipei-based representative of Manila Economic and Cultural
Office (MECO) , thanked Taiwan its cooperation on the project and for a previous
donation of a school dormitory and relief supplies it made to help a village in
the Philippines, which was hard hit by a huge mudslide recently.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Taichung Mayor Jason Hu expressed hope Friday that Taiwan will grant
landing visas to Hong Kong residents traveling to his central Taiwan city by
October.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong residents can obtain landing visas if they enter Taiwan via Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport in northern Taiwan or Kaohsiung International
Airport in southern Taiwan, but they still have to apply for visas if they enter
from Taichung Airport in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu said that currently there are 39 regular flights between Taichung and Hong
Kong per week, or around 160 flights per month serving between 30,000 and 40,000
passengers. He estimated that the ultimate destination of between 70 and 80
percent of the passengers on those flights is China.</P>
      <P>The mayor is worried that if weekend cross-strait charter flights are
established in July as pledged by President Ma Ying-jeou, Hong Kong's importance
as a transit point to China will decline and exchanges between Taiwan and Hong
Kong will be greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>Hu hoped that reductions in traffic can be offset by an increase in tourism
between residents of the two places.</P>
      <P>At present, the number of Hong Kong residents visiting Taichung is limited, Hu
said, but he believed there was room for growth, especially if the government
granted Hong Kong residents landing visas, which would facilitate their travel
to the city.</P>
      <P>The Taichung City Government is also planning to coordinate with related
agencies to provide discounts, necessary information and assistance to Hong Kong
and Macau visitors, he said.</P>
      <P>Hu hoped that Taichung could attract 60,000 Hong Kong tourists a month after
allowing them to enter central Taiwan using landing visas.</P>
      <P>Following the seminar in Hong Kong, Hu will first head to Britain to solicit
investment before heading to Switzerland to lobby for the International Olympic
Committee to reinstate baseball as an Olympic event.</P>
      <P>The sport's appearance at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing in August may be its
last after the sport was voted out as an Olympic event three years ago,
beginning with the London Games in 2012.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan
expressed his regret Friday over the Supreme  Court's decision  to uphold lower
court rulings that President-elect Ma Ying-jeou was not guilty of corruption.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks came a day after the Supreme Court finalized a ruling that Ma was
not guilty of the charges related to his alleged misuse of special allowance
funds during his term as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma once described special allowance funds as "public funds" to be
used on government business, Lee, citing the indictment, said Ma used the money
on his dog, utility bills and his daughters' tuition.</P>
      <P>This was hard evidence of Ma's use of the public funds for private purposes, Lee
said, adding that Ma, who will take office May 20, should still explain these
matters or apologize even though he was found not guilty.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court and Taiwan High Court ruled that the part of Ma's
special allowance in question, the half that he did not need to justify with
receipts, was a "substantive subsidy" that was for an official's discretionary
use and not "public funds."</P>
      <P>Although it was not a material part of its ruling, the Supreme Court disagreed
with the lower courts' definition and said the special allowance was a "public
fund" and had to be spent on job-related expenses.</P>
      <P>The definition of the special allowance and its usage was the key issue in Ma's
trials, and Lee urged judicial agencies to establish a uniform definition of the
fund for central and local government officials and create an authoritative
standard for similar cases.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu and other central and local officials have also been
indicted for their alleged misuse of their public funds.</P>

      <P>Following  the rejection  of the environmental  impact  assessment  report  on
the  Suao-Hualien expressway, various groups have been expressing a range of
views on the decision to effectively leave the matter up to the incoming
Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>"The rejection of the project (by an environmental review panel) was really
unexpected, " said Tsai Zhong-yue, a leader of one of the Hualien student groups
that have been actively opposed to the project for years.</P>
      <P>"We are happy about the decision, even though it did not totally focus on the
environmental impact," he added.</P>
      <P>The environmental review panel members rejected the construction plan due to
several unresolved controversial issues, including the lack of a clear
government policy on the development of eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Our efforts have paid off, " said Lisin.haluwey, another student association
leader who is of indigenous heritage. She said that her group will continue to
pay close attention to developments on the issue.</P>
      <P>But the Hualien County Council expressed disappointment over the decision,
saying that the residents of the county will not be pleased.</P>
      <P>"The expressway is necessary, in every way, for the people living in Hualien, "
said Chen Tai-zhou, a member of the Hualien County Council, who had made a brief
speech in favor of the plan during the review meeting.</P>
      <P>"I think that the people will react strongly (to the decision)," he said, adding
that proponents of the project will discuss in few days how to respond.</P>
      <P>As the environmental impact assessment of the expressway designed to connect
Suao and Hualien, eastern Taiwan was being reviewed Friday, many Hualien County
residents came out to show their support for the project, while an estimated 200
students, each carrying a lily, traveled by train early from Hualien to Taipei
and staged a guitar concert outside the meeting to demonstrate their concerns
over the plan.</P>
      <P>About two dozen Hualien County councilors also gathered some supporters outside
the building of the Environmental Protection Administration, where they cried
out for Hualien residents to be given a safe transportation option with the
construction of the expressway.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan protests Greenpeace shipboard check</HEADLINE>

(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) issued a statement Friday that
condemned Greenpeace activists for boarding a Taiwanese fishing boat in the
South Pacific earlier this week to check for alleged illegal catch.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the Pingtung-based 98-ton "Niensheng No. 3" was on
the open seas north of the Solomon Islands April 21 when Greenpeace  activists
interrupted its operations,  using a 2,000-ton vessel equipped with a
helicopter.</P>
      <P>The Greenpeace activists, after circling the Taiwanese ship for nearly an hour
aboard a yacht, demanded permission to board to check whether there was any
illegal shark fin harvest or excessive tuna fishing.</P>
      <P>"The Ninensheng skipper had no choice but to accede to the request by the
Greenpeace activists," the statement said, adding that although the activists
did not find any evidence of irregularities after a thorough inspection that
included photographing,  they continued to trail the Taiwanese ship for six to
seven hours after they returned to their own yacht.</P>
      <P>The activists did not stop the chase until after the Taiwanese ship entered the
Solomon Islands' exclusive economic zone.</P>
      <P>According to the International Marine Law, when a vessel is operating on the
open seas, it is under the jurisdiction of the country with which it registered
or the country to which its skipper belongs.</P>
      <P>As the Niensheng No. 3 was fishing on the open seas, the statement  said,  its
skipper could have legally rejected the Greenpeace activists' demand for
shipboard inspection, inquiry or law enforcement.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Niensheng No. 3 is high on the list of vessels permitted to
fish in the region by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission
(WCPFC) and the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), the statement argued
that Greenpeace activists' forced shipboard check, without the Taiwan
government's approval, was in stark violation of Taiwan's legal jurisdiction and
the International Law.</P>
      <P>"We strongly protest the Greenpeace activists' action, " the statement read.</P>
      <P>The incident marked the first time that a Taiwanese fishing vessel fell victim
to Greenpeace's forced shipboard inspections on the open seas.</P>
      <P>Fishery officials urged that Taiwanese deep-sea fishing vessels to immediately
ask relevant government agencies to assist in grappling with the issues if they
encounter a similar situation in the future.</P>
      <P>The Niensheng No.3 left Taiwan Jan. 16 for operations in waters near the Solomon
Islands which has issued a license to allow the ship to fish for tuna, sailfish
and shark.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Yilan County government has decided to allow free entry to the Dongshan
River Water Park from May 1 to July 11 in an attempt to attract visitors to the
county.</P>
      <P>County government officials acknowledged Friday that the park, which attracted
more than 1 million visitors each year from its inception in 1994 to 2004, has
seen declining numbers in the past three years, probably because its facilities
are no longer fresh and appealing.</P>
      <P>The water park was selected as the venue of the annual Yilan International
Collegiate Invitational Regatta between 1996 and 2005, and the annual Yilan
International Children's Folklore and Folkgame Festival for 12 years between
1995 and 2006. Both events were terminated mainly because the county government
could no longer afford the financial losses.</P>
      <P>With the summer tourism season approaching, the county government decided to
waive all entry fees -- NT$80 per adult, NT$60 per child, and NT$40 per senior
citizen -- for 72 days from May 1.</P>
      <P>Visitors, however, are still required to pay parking fees for their vehicles --
NT$100 each for buses, NT$50 for cars and NT$20 for motorcycles.</P>
      <P>The Dongshan River Water Park opened to the public in 1994, with "water
intimacy" as its theme. The park contains a boating area, a paddling area and a
family area.</P>
      <P>The main facilities in the park include an outdoor theater, paddling pools, a
museum with exhibits of dragon boats, a swimming pool and a gym.</P>

    <DATELINE>Manila,  the Philippines,  April 24 (CNA)
04/26/08  10:55:21
(By Emerson T. Lim and T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A weather observation station, established by Taiwan and the Philippines, was
inaugurated in the Filipino province of Rizal Thursday to help both countries
better predict typhoons  and enhance the accuracy  of weather forecasts.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the weather station in the province 20 kilometers east of
Manila is the result of one of two bilateral projects between Taiwan's National
Science Council (NSC) and the Philippines' Department of Science and Technology
(DOST).</P>
      <P>Taiwan donated US$170,000 last November to fund the research projects, which are
focused on weather disaster prevention and rainfall analysis technology.</P>
      <P>The weather station will collect data on typhoons and general climatic
information by releasing high-altitude weather balloons tied to a radio
monitoring device on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>The balloon and monitoring device cost a combined NT$14,500 (US$477) and cannot
be reused. The device will send data back to the station's computers for
analysis, and the data can then be sent to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>NSC chief  Chen Chien-jen  said after presiding  over the inauguration ceremony
that the device can gather data on wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and
ambient humidity.</P>
      <P>The data, he said, would result in more accurate prediction of the formation and
the paths of typhoons, and could help safeguard the lives and property of people
in both countries.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan and the Philippines, which do not have official ties,
will increase the training and exchange of personnel, and share satellite
weather data.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to the Philippines Wu Hsin-hsing, who was also present
at the ceremony, said that the two countries are geographically close and that
many typhoons that hit Taiwan are formed off the coast of the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The bilateral cooperation will expand the forecasting scope of Taiwan's central
weather bureau to include its neighbor to the south, Wu continued.</P>
      <P>The envoy also said he hopes that both sides can strengthen technological
collaboration in other fields, which he believed will be conducive to bilateral
relations.</P>
      <P>For his part, DOST Secretary Estrella Alabastro said at the ceremony he hopes
that Taiwan and the Philippines can maintain a long-term technological
collaboration.</P>
      <P>Antonio Basilio, Taipei-based representative of Manila Economic and Cultural
Office (MECO) , thanked Taiwan its cooperation on the project and for a previous
donation of a school dormitory and relief supplies it made to help a village in
the Philippines, which was hard hit by a huge mudslide recently.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan
expressed his regret Friday over the Supreme  Court's decision  to uphold lower
court rulings that President-elect Ma Ying-jeou was not guilty of corruption.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks came a day after the Supreme Court finalized a ruling that Ma was
not guilty of the charges related to his alleged misuse of special allowance
funds during his term as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma once described special allowance funds as "public funds" to be
used on government business, Lee, citing the indictment, said Ma used the money
on his dog, utility bills and his daughters' tuition.</P>
      <P>This was hard evidence of Ma's use of the public funds for private purposes, Lee
said, adding that Ma, who will take office May 20, should still explain these
matters or apologize even though he was found not guilty.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court and Taiwan High Court ruled that the part of Ma's
special allowance in question, the half that he did not need to justify with
receipts, was a "substantive subsidy" that was for an official's discretionary
use and not "public funds."</P>
      <P>Although it was not a material part of its ruling, the Supreme Court disagreed
with the lower courts' definition and said the special allowance was a "public
fund" and had to be spent on job-related expenses.</P>
      <P>The definition of the special allowance and its usage was the key issue in Ma's
trials, and Lee urged judicial agencies to establish a uniform definition of the
fund for central and local government officials and create an authoritative
standard for similar cases.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu and other central and local officials have also been
indicted for their alleged misuse of their public funds.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The leaders of 21 Taiwanese American groups have urged U.S. President George W.
Bush to boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics slated for August
over China's violent crackdown on Tibetan protesters and its military
intimidation of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a letter dated April 24, the leaders told Bush that if he were to attend the
event, he "would be viewed as endorsing China's appalling policies toward Tibet
and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"In the words of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, China is carrying out `cultural
genocide' in Tibet. The United States must not be seen as colluding in
committing this crime," they said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Bush's repeated calls for China to enter into dialogue with the
Dalai Lama "have all but fallen on deaf ears, " the leaders said China's brutal
suppression of protesters in Tibet should not be tolerated as "business as
usual."</P>
      <P>They dismissed as "arrogant" and "imperialistic" a demand by Chinese President
Hu Jintao that the Dalai Lama accept Tibet and Taiwan as "inalienable parts of
China" as a precondition for Tibet-China dialogue.</P>
      <P>"Hu is a dictator to be shunned, rather than an enlightened leader with whom you
should share the stage in celebrating the Olympics, " they said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese Americans pointed out that several European leaders have announced
their intention to boycott the event and urged Bush to make a similar
announcement immediately.</P>
      <P>Those who signed the letter included Formosan Association for Public Affairs

      <P>Japan should help have the United Nations list a Taiwanese reservoir built by a
Japanese engineer during Japan's colonial rule of Taiwan as a world heritage
site, Taiwan's representative to Japan has suggested.</P>
      <P>Koh  Se-kai,  head  of the Taipei  Economic  and Cultural Representative Office
in Japan, made the call in a speech delivered Friday to a group of academics and
business executives in Kanazawa, capital of Ishikawa Prefecture.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and Ishikawa have a special historical link, Koh said the
Wushantou reservoir in southern Taiwan's Tainan County was built by Yoichi
Hatsuta, an Ishikawa-born engineer.</P>
      <P>"Hatsuta built the reservoir, the greatest of its kind of that time  in
Southeast  Asia,  using  the semi-hydraulic-filled-dam construction method," Koh
said, adding that its 16,000 km-long canal and drainage system have made the
Jia-Nan plain covering Tainan and neighboring Chiayi counties the rice basket of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"With  its  rich  historical,  cultual  and  technological significance, the
reservoir deserves to be listed as a world heritage site," Koh said.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan cannot file an application with the United Nations Education,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on its own as it is no longer a
member of the world body. "Against this backdrop, we need your assistance to
realize the ambitious goal," Koh told his audience.</P>
      <P>Filing an application for UNESCO world heritage listing on other's behalf is
permissible, Koh went on, adding that France has, for instance, asked the
U.N.-affiliated organization to list 23 historically important buildings
scattered across seven countries around the globe as world heritage sites.</P>
      <P>All 23 buildings were designed by the internationally renowned 20th Century
French architect Le Corbusier (1887-1965). Among them is the National Museum of
Western Art in Tokyo, which was completed in March 1959 as a symbol of the
resumption of diplomatic ties between Japan and France after World War II.</P>
      <P>"If you take pride in the construction  of the Wushantou reservoir, you should
not hesitate to lend a helping hand, " Koh urged.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China -- Taiwan's official title -- was a founding member of the
United Nations, but it was forced out of the organization in 1971 when the world
body gave the "China seat" to the People's Republic of China at its expense.</P>
      <P>In his Friday speech, Koh further said Taiwan-Japan exchanges will get another
boost June 1 when scheduled flights between Ishikawa's Komatsu Airport and
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport will be inaugurated.</P>
      <P>He also called for Japan to adhere to its policy toward Taiwan if it signs a
fourth communique with China when Chinese President Hu Jintao visits Japan early
next month.</P>
      <P>"Japan should not waver on its stance of just `understand' and `respect, ' but
not `recognize' China's claim that Taiwan is part of its territory," he urged.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese officials expressed regret Saturday on a U.S. decision to keep the
country on a watch list for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection.</P>
      <P>The Intellectual Property Office under the Ministry of Economic Affairs noted
that Taiwan has long been working to establish a friendly environment for IPR
protection and urged the U.S. government to consider the efforts made by Taiwan
in recent years.</P>
      <P>The efforts have received recognition from the American Chamber of Commerce in
Taipei, which recommended in March that the United States remove Taiwan from the
"Special 301" watch list, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In the annual Special 301 Report released Friday, the Office of the United
States Trade Representative (USTR) said an out-of-cycle review will be initiated
soon and completed this summer to monitor progress on "selected outstanding
issues" to assess whether to remove Taiwan from the list.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's achievements in IPR protection over the past year, the report noted
that the Legislative Yuan passed in June 2007 a new law aimed at ending illegal
file-sharing over peer-to-peer platforms, which enabled officials to shut down
some of the worst violators.</P>
      <P>Other progress made by Taiwan includes continued efforts to establish an IP
section at the Special Prosecutors Office, and the creation and issuance in
October 2007 of the Action Plan for Protecting IP Rights on School Campuses, the
report said.</P>
      <P>However, the USTR urges Taiwan to make the specialized IPR Court operational as
soon as possible, continue to implement the 2007 Campus Action Plan, continue
its efforts to combat counterfeiting and Internet piracy, and work closely with
the Legislative Yuan to pass pending IPR legislation regarding liability of
Internet service providers for copyright infringements.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan is asked to continue to take effective action against piracy on the
Internet, especially on TANet -- the Internet service provider administered by
Taiwan's Ministry of Education -- and against the unauthorized use of
copyrighted material on or near universities.</P>
      <P>The annual Special 301 Report, which reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of
IPR protection by U.S. trade partners, placed nine countries on the Priority
Watch List and 36 countries on the lower level Watch List for 2008.</P>
      <P>After remaining on the Priority Watch List for four years, Taiwan was lowered to
the Watch List at the end of 2004.</P>

      <P>The southern port city of Kaohsiung celebrated Saturday the breaking of the
100-km mark for the total length of its bicycle path system.</P>
      <P>Mayor Chen Chu cycled on the Side Harbor Line of the urban bike system along
with Public Works Bureau Director Wu Hung-mou and City Councilor Lin Yi-cheng of
the opposition People First Party, as well as Kaohsiung citizens, to mark the
event. Kaohsiung now has the longest urban bike path in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Comparing the city with London, Wu said the density of bike paths in Kaohsiung
will catch up with London by the end of this year, by which time the total
length of bike paths in the city will have reached 150 km.</P>
      <P>London has 1,500 km of bike paths, but the city is also 10 times larger than
Kaohsiung, Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to Public Works Bureau data, as of April 20, the total length of
Kaohsiung City's urban bike system had reached 105.68 km, and will have expanded
to 167.05 km by September 2010.</P>
      <P>Chen said the city government is also building bike paths around Mass Rapid
Transit (MRT) stations to allow commuters to ride to the MRT before catching a
train to their workplace.</P>
      <P>The bike system is part of a strategy to save energy and reduce carbon
emissions, the mayor said, noting that in the past, the air pollution rate in
Kaohsiung City was recorded at 10 percent, but has dropped to 6.3 percent
recently,  according  to tests by the Environmental Protection Administration.</P>
      <P>The city government will be outlining more green projects, including a bike
rental program that is already being carried out, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung urban bike system, covering prime city areas and key tourist
attractions, is made up of five separate networks -- including the riverside
bluebelt bike path, the boulevard bike path, the rapid transit commuting bike
path, the landscape roadway bike path and the park bike path.</P>

      <P>Representatives of minority groups urged the incoming administration of
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou Saturday to take more care of the rights of
minorities, such as indigenous people, foreign spouses and foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>They made the appeal at a forum organized by the Community Empowering Society,
Taiwan, the Peacetime Foundation of Taiwan and the Organization of Urban Re-s.</P>
      <P>Sechin Yeong-Shyang Chien, an associate research fellow of Academia Sinica,
Taiwan' s top research institute, said that while Taiwan is making more efforts
toward reconciliation with various ethnic groups, "the rights of aborigines,
foreign spouses and foreign laborers should also be emphasized."</P>
      <P>Lan Ki-hue, a Vietnamese spouse fo a local man who represents the TransAsia
Sisters Association, said local people are not familiar with alien cultures and
that this has inflicted psychological wounds upon foreign spouses and their
children.</P>
      <P>"Inappropriate language and words used by locals to refer to foreign spouses and
their children have caused misunderstandings and have hurt our children, " said
Lan, adding that " the government should set up regulations to punish
offenders."</P>
      <P>On behalf of the estimated 365,000 foreign laborers in Taiwan, mainly from
Southeast Asia, Ku Yu-ling, chairwoman of the Taiwan International Workers'
Association, said the rights of foreign laborers are infringed upon in Taiwanese
society for "they cannot be naturalized and possess no right to vote."</P>
      <P>Ku lamented the lack of political rights that has "enslaved" foreign workers,
depriving them of the right to choose their own employers and making them
"slaves under feudalism."</P>
      <P>"There will be no reconciliation within Taiwanese society if this inhumane
situation is not improved," she added.</P>
      <P>Paiwan aboriginal poet Monanung said that indigenous people have been treated as
subhumans during past centuries, and urged the new administration to understand
the real meaning of prioritizing ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>A harmonious nation should be not only reconciliation among ethic groups but
also between the people and nature, Monanung said, adding that the incoming
administration should stop depredating the land for profit.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan's first build-own-operate (BOO) project for manufacturing flu
vaccine has been delayed for about three years, the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) remains optimistic that the project will eventually proceed and that
Taiwan will find itself in a superior position compared to developing countries.</P>
      <P>The project, initiated in 2004, was officially launched by the CDC in late 2005
with the aim of establishing the capacity to manufacture enough flu vaccine,
which can be transferred to produce pandemic trivalance flu vaccine, should an
H5N1-like pandemic occur.</P>
      <P>It would also make Taiwan the first developing country to manufacture flu
vaccine using the second generation cell-based method.</P>
      <P>But the ambitious project has met a variety of obstacles, both inside and
outside of Taiwan. A deal between the CDC and the Dutch pharmaceutical company
Akzo Nobel was put on hold, first due to opposition from domestic industries and
then by the acquisition of Akzo Nobel by Schering-Plough.</P>
      <P>A high-ranking CDC official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNA that
both the CDC and Schering-Plough Corp. are still very hopeful of reaching
consensus, saying that "the project is not dead, we just have not signed the
contract yet."</P>
      <P>Admitting that the negotiations have been at a standstill since the U.S.-based
pharmaceutical company demanded "a looser schedule, " the CDC hopes not to
reopen negotiations.</P>
      <P>The official further indicated that Schering-Plough is still very interested in
the project and that a senior official will soon visit Taiwan to discuss the
matter.</P>
      <P>Asked if the CDC is concerned by the fact that South Korea will begin to produce
flu vaccine in 2010, the official said Taiwan can still take the lead in this
area among developing countries.</P>
      <P>"What we plan to produce is tissue-based vaccine, which means cell cultivation,
" said the official, adding that the vaccine that South Korea plans to produce
is egg-based, which is a first- generation technology.</P>
      <P>He added that the company chose to cooperate with Taiwan rather than with China
because it "considers Taiwan's intellectual property rights protection to be
much better."</P>
      <P>According to the original plan, the vaccine plant should have been completed in
2007 and operational in 2008, producing 2.5 million doses of trivalence flu
vaccine on an annual basis, with the Department of Health promising to purchase
the vaccine for NT$4 billion (US$1.3 billion).</P>
      <P>Despite the CDC's optimism, however, the earliest possible target time for the
project will be 2011, and then only if the two parties can reach an agreement
this year.</P>

      <P>Scratches left on tableware can allow the formation of bacterial residue, with
melamine dining ware the most prone to high amounts of microbial residue, a
professor said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Wen-cheng, a professor at National Yang Ming University, made the remarks
when he unveiled the result of tests he conducted for bacterial residue on six
types of tableware commonly found on the Taiwanese market.</P>
      <P>The six types of dining  ware are classed  as three-fold strengthened glass,
strengthened glass,  strengthened porcelain, porcelain, aluminum and melamine.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that after the tableware had been used for six months, he applied
units of microbes such as e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa
and salmonella enterica to their surfaces. He then left it to dry naturally
before washing and assessing the microbial residue.</P>
      <P>"The test results show that melamine tableware had the highest quantities of
microbial residue," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The melamine plates had 7,600 colony-forming units (CFUs) , followed by the
strengthened glass tableware at 1,875 CFUs, aluminum tableware at 1,572 CFUs,
porcelain tableware at 1,450 CFUs, strengthened porcelain at 820 CFUs and three-
fold strengthened glass at 740 CFUs.</P>
      <P>Melamine tableware is very popular in kindergartens, eateries and some families
because it is so difficult to break.</P>
      <P>If scratched, however, large amounts of microbial residue will form on melamine
tableware, especially e. coli, which can cause urinary tract infection,
diarrhea, encephalitis and septicemia.</P>
      <P>Of the staphylococcus aureus residue, aluminum tableware had the highest
residue, followed by melamine. Strengthened glass, three-fold strengthened
glass, porcelain and strengthened porcelain tableware had no residue.</P>
      <P>Of the pseudomonas aeruginosa residue, melamine was the worst offender, followed
by strengthened glass, strengthened porcelain and aluminum.</P>
      <P>In terms of salmonella enterica residue, strengthened glass had the most
residue, while the three-fold strengthened glass had the least.</P>
      <P>Tsai suggested that consumers choose solid tableware that does not break easily
and that has a glossy surface. The public should also avoid using scratched
tableware, while dishes used for children and the elderly should undergo
ultraviolet or high temperature disinfection after use.</P>

Chinese cuisine competition held in Singapore earlier this week, scoring lightly

      <P>The Imperial Challenge competition, showing Chinese cuisine at its best, was one

      <P>The five-member team, put together by the Taiwan Master Chef Academy and led by

      <P>The team competed with eight others from China, Singapore and Malaysia in the
three-day competition that ran from April 22-25, qualifying for the final round

      <P>In the final round, each team was tasked with making Chinese dishes with a list

    <HEADLINE>Passengers to benefit most from Taiwan-China direct flights</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
04/26/08  19:28:25</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As airlines operating the Taiwan-Hong Kong and the Taiwan-Macau routes gear up
for the opportunities and challenges brought by direct flights linking Taiwan
and China, passengers without doubt will come out as the biggest winners.</P>
      <P>The direct flight services, one of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's main election
campaign policies, are slated to kick off in July, initially covering weekends
before later expanding to daily flights by the end of this year, ending decades-
long indirect flights in which passengers have to transfer via a third place,
mostly Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>According to unofficial counts, 4 million Taiwanese visit China annually, of
which 70 percent travel through Hong Kong, making the route a "golden route" for
carriers thanks to its high load rate and revenue.</P>
      <P>In response to reports in the local media that China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's
biggest carrier, is planning to reduce its services between Taipei and Hong Kong
when daily direct flight services are implemented,  Ringo Chao,  chairman and
president of CAL said optimistically that the company is ready for weekend
direct flights.</P>
      <P>Characterizing the direct services as a positive development, Chao said that "it
not only lets passengers enjoy cheaper fares and save a lot of time, but also
benefits CAL, " one of the largest carriers on the Taiwan-Hong Kong route second
only to Cathy Pacific Airways.</P>
      <P>"CAL will no longer need to share revenue with its Chinese counterpart," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Chao declined to comment in detail on how CAL will adjust its operations, saying
only that "matters such as flight destinations and frequency can only be decided
by the related authorities of Taiwan and China."</P>
      <P>Eric Lin, manager of the Public Affairs Division at EVA Air, said that "EVA will
deal with the changes after the new government issues directives on direct
flights."</P>
      <P>According to Lin, an estimated 1 million passengers fly with EVA to Hong Kong
per year, and some 50 percent to 70 percent of them then transfer to China.</P>
      <P>EVA operates eight daily flights between Taipei and Hong Kong, four flights
between Taipei and Macau and another two between the southern port city of
Kaohsiung and Macau.</P>
      <P>Lin reiterated that "the direct services really benefit our airlines and also
make it more convenient for passengers, " and added that that "we have been
looking forward to this moment for a long time.</P>
      <P>While CAL and EVA are seen as the major benefactors of the direct flights, the
Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific and Macau-based Air Macau seem set to lose some
ground since they are excluded from the direct flights.</P>
      <P>But an aviation expert disagreed, saying if direct flights are limited to a few
destinations and frequencies, the impact on Cathay will be minimal.</P>
      <P>He also noted that Cathay has been expecting the change since "day one, "
implying that it is ready for the new challenge. As a major hub connecting Asia
and Europe and America, many Taiwanese passengers heading for London and Paris
still have to use Cathay.</P>
      <P>Dragonair, an affiliate of Cathay that provides services to 21 destinations in
China from Hong Kong, could be another factor keeping Cathay in the race.</P>
      <P>Air Macau, which operates 10 flights between Taiwan and Macau and another three
flights between Kaohsiung and Macau, could be in a much more difficult
situation.</P>
      <P>Noting that some 70 percent of its 400,000 passengers go to China through Macau
annually and that Taiwan-China direct flights must eat into its profits from the
Taiwan-Macau-China routes, Gary Yang, marketing  and sales manager of Air Macau,
Taiwan,  remained optimistic.</P>
      <P>"This (direct links between Taiwan and China) is already a trend that Air Macau
has expected for a long time," Lin said, adding that " our company cannot solely
rely on one route and needs to make changes accordingly."</P>
      <P>Although Air Macau will not have a share of the direct flights, Yang said it
will devote itself to providing passengers with more diverse services, adding
that "Air Macau also has its advantages as it brings passengers to 12
destinations around China on a daily basis."</P>
      <P>Another expert warned that the prospect for CAL and EVA might not be so rosy as
expected, since airlines in China will join in the competition for the direct
flights.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government will hold the last legally binding group wedding
Sunday on Yangmingshan, a mountain suburb of the city, to coincide with the
mountain's calla lily season, a local official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, marriages will only be legal after marriage
registration at local household registration offices after an amendment to the
Civil Law is implemented May 23.</P>
      <P>The current regulations stipulate that a marriage is considered binding if there
is a public ceremony and at least two notaries. "Ceremonial marriages" such as
group weddings, notary weddings, religious wedding ceremonies and wedding
banquets will no longer have legal effect, as the amended law requires a
marriage registration, the official said.</P>
      <P>In order to promote the new law and provide convenience for newlyweds, Taipei
city government household registration office personnel will provide
registration services for couples who attend Sunday's group wedding.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin will be the notary for the city's last group marriage
with legal effect, the official said, adding that the city has held 193 group
weddings for 14,607 couples since May 20, 1973.</P>
      <P>The official said each couple that attends Sunday's wedding have their own
special love stories and that in order to create a unforgettable group wedding
for them, the city government chose the romantic venue with blooming white calla
lilies and will present each couple with a marriage certificate made of gold
foil.</P>

      <P>An all-out search for eight missing divers in waters off Kenting National Park
at the southernmost tip of Taiwan had not yielded any results as of Saturday
evening, according to coast guard sources.</P>
      <P>The eight holidaymakers -- six men and two women -- were reported missing while
scuba diving in waters near Chihsingyen, located some 12 nautical miles
southwest of Kenting in the southernmost county of Pingtung, the sources said.</P>
      <P>They left for Chihsingyen along with four other holidaymakers aboard a yacht
early in the morning. With the assistance of a dive company, the 12 began scuba
diving in waters between Oluanbi and Chihsingyen at 10:30 a.m. and were supposed
to return to the yacht at 11:30 a.m.</P>
      <P>However, eight of them failed to return to the yacht on schedule. Strong winds
and high currents in the region meant that the skipper of the yacht failed to
find the missing divers. The skipper then reported the case to the Hengchun
coast guard squad in charge of coastal patrols in the Kenting National Park
region.</P>
      <P>Coast guard teams from Pingtung and neighboring Kaohsiung County launched an
all-out sea and aerial search as soon as they were informed of the case at
around noon, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The eight missing divers were identified as Hung Yu-sheng, 29; Ting Po-ling,
32; Wang Chih-yu,  25; Wang Shun-ping, 28; Tu Ting-chang, 38; Kuo Chun-hsien,

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will rent a place in Taipei as a temporary measure
after he steps down and moves out of his current official residence May 20, the
Presidential Office said in a news release Saturday.</P>
      <P>The statement said that Chen's own apartment on Taipei's Ming Sheng East Road is
infested with termites and that although pest experts have been working on them,
the problem has yet to be resolved.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is better for Chen to remain in Taipei for the time being
considering the physical condition of first lady Wu Shu-jen, who has been
wheelchair-bound since a car accident in 1985.</P>
      <P>The statement further said Chen has purchased an apartment in Kaohsiung. The
president said while campaigning for Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu in 2006 that he
loves Kaohsiung and would like to live in the southern port city after his
retirement May 20, 2008.</P>
      <P>The president has not purchased any other property and might shuttle between
Taipei and Kaohsiung for some time after he steps down, according to the news
release.</P>
      <P>His daughter Chen Hsin-yu lived in the Ming Sheng East Road apartment after her
marriage in 2001 but moved out in 2006 after her husband, orthopedic surgeon
Chao Chien-ming, came under the media spotlight in connection with insider
trading.</P>
      <P>The news release also said that after the termite problem and safety issues are
resolved, the president will consider moving back in or selling it.</P>
      <P>Some TV reports have said that Chen's son, Chen Chih-chung, has bought a house
worth NT$200 million (US$6.58 million) in Taipei's posh Hsinyi district,
suggesting that the president might move in with his son, daughter-in-law and
their toddler daughter.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung said Saturday that he might
visit China after the May 20 inauguration of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Wu said that as head of the ruling party, he is willing to visit China "as long
as it will be conducive to cross-Taiwan Strait peaceful  development,
contribute  to the improvement  of the cross-strait atmosphere and benefit the
safety of Taiwan and the welfare of its people."</P>
      <P>On reports that cited Chinese sources as saying that Beijing hopes to keep the
party-to-party communication forum -- referring to the KMT and the Communist
Party of China (CPC) -- which was started by honorary KMT Chairman Lien Chan in
2005, to discuss guiding principles on cross-strait relations, Wu said that Ma
has expressed his stance clearly.</P>
      <P>Ma hopes that the stalled communications between the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), can resume after a nine-year hiatus,
with the KMT-CPC contact serving in a complementary role, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS were set up by Taipei and Beijing authorities, respectively,
to discuss mainly technical issues related to civic exchanges in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that Lien will soon visit China and that he is expected to
meet with Chinese leader Hu Jintao for the fourth time since their first meeting
in 2005.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks when he attended the 20th anniversary of the establishment
of the I-Kuan Tao headquarters in Shihkang, Taichung County. I-Kuan Tao, a new
religious movement that originated in 20th-Century  China,  incorporates  much
older  elements  from Confucianism,  Taoism and Chinese Buddhism, and recognizes
the validity of non-Chinese religious traditions such as Christianity and Islam.</P>

      <P>The incoming Kuomintang (KMT) government should exercise prudence in opening the
door wider to Chinese visitors in order to keep epidemics at bay, a lawmaker
from the soon-to-be-opposition  Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  urged
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Kuan Bi-ling made the call amid reports  that President-elect Ma
Ying-jeou is determined to launch direct weekend charter  flights  across the
Taiwan Strait in early July and simultaneously opens Taiwan's door wider to
Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Kuan said she is worried that hasty opening to Chinese tourists could adversely
impact Taiwan's  disease control and epidemic prevention as some contagious
illnesses, such as tuberculosis (TB) , are prevalent in China.</P>
      <P>Just recently, Kuan said, the KMT-controlled Legislative Yuan invited relevant
government officials to report on preparations for further opening to Chinese
tourists along with the much-anticipated inauguration of direct cross-strait
weekends charter flights.</P>
      <P>"Much to my regret, no public health officials were invited to report on needed
preparations  for better disease control and prevention  following  the
implementation  of such  'open-door' policies, " Kuan said, adding that their
absence reflects flawed policy planning.</P>
      <P>Stressing that imposing stricter epidemic prevention measures does not mean any
discrimination against Chinese tourists, Kuan said both outgoing and incoming
governments should step up disease prevention efforts lest increased cross-
strait engagements become a new source of disease spreading.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will offer legal aid to a Tibetan
activist of Republic of China nationality who was arrested in Japan Saturday for
attempting to disrupt the Nagano leg of the Beijing Olympic torch relay, an
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tashi Tsering, vice chairman of the Taiwan chapter of the Tibetan Youth
Congress, was arrested after he attempted to seize the Olympic torch from Ai
Fukuhara, a Japanese table tennis player, during the flame's relay in Nagano in
central Japan.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said Tashi Tsering is from a Tibetan family that
took refuge in India after China took control of Tibet in the 1950s. He came to
Taiwan in the 1990s and has obtained Republic of China citizenship.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, Tashi Tsering was detained and was to be held incommunicado
for 48 hours at Nagano's central police station.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in Japan has been informed of the incident, Yeh
said, adding that the representative office will keep close tabs on the
situation and will send staff members to see Tashi Tsering as soon as he is
allowed to receive visitors.</P>
      <P>"The representative office will consult lawyers in order to figure out feasible
ways to assist him," Yeh added.</P>
      <P>Nagano was the 16th stop of the 2008 Beijing Olympic torch relay. Japanese
police dispatched over 3,000 officers to safeguard the torch, but minor clashes
still broke out several times between Tibetan activists and Chinese expatriates
in Japan. Besides Tashi Tsering, four Japanese activists were also arrested.</P>

      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
chairman-designate of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , arrived in China's
southeastern coastal city of Xiamen Saturday for a short visit.</P>
      <P>Chiang,  who has been appointed by KMT President-elect Ma Ying-jeou as Taiwan's
top negotiator with China, met with He Lifeng, secretary  of the Communist Party
of China's Xiamen Municipal Committee, for talks in Xiamen Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chiang told He that as soon as President-elect Ma is inaugurated May 20, he will
see to it that cross-Taiwan Strait weekend charter flights are opened,
restrictions on people traveling across the strait via Taiwan's outlying islands
of Kinmen and Matsu are relaxed and Taiwan opens its doors to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>"Among other immediate benefits, the opening of direct air links across the
Taiwan Strait will help lower the costs of Taiwanese businesses  operating  in
China,  which will help raise their competitiveness, " Chiang told his host.</P>
      <P>"Closer cross-strait business and trade exchanges, including allowing the
Taiwanese financial service sector and hospitals to open branches in China, will
also contribute to raising the quality of China's business operations and
services," he added.</P>
      <P>For his part, He, the top official in charge of political and business policies
in Xiamen City, said Xiamen, which has accelerated bilateral ties with the
islands of Kinmen and Matsu over the past several years, is now more actively
expanding its own seaport, airport facilities and road development to prepare
itself for engaging in closer trade and tourist exchanges with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said Xiamen not only hopes to see the opening of direct cross-strait air
links and the cancellation of all restrictions on the "mini three links, " but
also looks forward to seeing the opening of direct shipping links between Xiamen
and Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>It is Chiang's sixth visit to Fujian Province. The last time he was in Xiamen
was in September 2007, when he attended a workshop on international  investment
in China  sponsored  by the  Xiamen authorities.</P>
      <P>Chiang flew from Shanghai to Xiamen a day earlier on an executive plane provided
exclusively for him by the Shanghai-based Taiwanese firm Want Want China
Holding.</P>
      <P>The Xiamen visit was the third leg of a five-city tour of southern China, mainly
to express appreciation on behalf of Ma to the Taiwanese businessmen there, many
of whom showed avid support for Ma in the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who has visited Shanghai and Kunshan in Jiangsu Province since April 24,
was scheduled to depart from Xiamen Sunday for Shenzhen and Dongguan in
Guangdong Province.</P>
      <P>The five southern Chinese cities are areas where most of the Taiwan businessmen
operating in China converge.</P>

near-7 percent pass rate.</P>
      <P>Facing the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis that has shaken the global financial
market and the potential policies pledged by the incoming administration to
intensify economic ties across the Taiwan Strait, HNFH Chairman Lin Ming-cheng
said the company is targeting applicants that could become the backbone of the
financial group currently among the top 10 of the country's financial holding
companies.</P>
      <P>"We have set high thresholds for the application qualifications, implementing a
recruiting strategy that will help us to find the best people to cope with the
challenges in the financial world," Lin said, pinpointing  a potential
relaxation  of regulations  governing cross-strait banking investment, which is
one of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's campaign commitments.</P>
      <P>The expanded exam opens 420 job vacancies within three major categories --
banking agents, counter staff and middle management.</P>
      <P>Citing the higher-quality demand of the recruitment drive, Lin said that the
subjects for the written exam for middle management include financial
management, international business and economics, along with an oral exam
requiring fluent English-language listening and speaking.</P>
      <P>Lin further indicated that the company plans to send some of these qualifiers
overseas for further training, saying that the international financial crisis
has led to the need for globally trained bankers.</P>
      <P>Unlike the past HNFH recruitment  exams,  which were held separately among its
subsidiaries, including Hua Nan Commercial Bank and Hua Nan Securities, the
group this year integrated its resources and conformed the test standards to
increase transparency and fairness, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"We made a groundbreaking change in the test formality in an attempt to lure the
most professional employees in the financial business," Lin noted, adding that
this new measure will be continued into future recruitment drives.</P>
      <P>Touching on China's financial market, Lin said the company hopes to be among the
first to make inroads into the 1.3 billion China market, but noted that this
plan will not be implemented until Taiwan and China seal an agreement on
financial regulations.</P>
      <P>"We are waiting for the government to negotiate with China to allow local banks
to upgrade their offices in China," Lin said.</P>
      <P>HNFH President David J.Y. Lee said that if the bank has suffered losses incurred
by the U.S. credit crunch, there has been a "slight impact, " but he added that
company has taken hedge positions to ensure that the impact has been kept to a
minimum.</P>
      <P>He also said the early stage of the business in China will target China-based
Taiwanese investors. "We will go wherever these people go," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Travel-loving foreign couple settles in tranquil Penghu</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>By Ruth Wang

    <TEXT>
      <P/>
      <P>CNA Staff Reporter</P>
      <P>Taipei, April 27 (CNA) A Canadian man and his Japanese wife, both avid
travelers, have taken up residence in Taiwan's outlying island of Penghu, after
falling in love with the tranquility found in Penghu's waters, mountains, and
beaches.</P>
      <P>Rod Harvey, who is from Canada' Quebec, and his wife Sayaki Kato, from Japan's
Nagoya, have stayed in Penghu for three years after traveling around the world
for many years.</P>
      <P>Now they live a life enjoying unhurriedly Penghu's sunshine, sea waves, and
lovely firewheel flowers.</P>
      <P>Harvey teaches English at the Makung Elementary School in Penghu County's Makung
City, and Kato makes her paintings and graphic designs at home, which is an old
house that they rent near the beach.</P>
      <P>Kato said Penghu has everything that they have hoped for: old houses, beaches,
surfing, and diving. She said she usually swims at the beach when the sun is
still strong and most Taiwanese girls do not like to go outside.</P>
      <P>"It is really a luxury as if I own the whole beach, the sea, and sunshine," Kato
said.</P>
      <P>Harvey and Kato, both travel-loving people, took their own journeys around the
world before they met in Egypt when Harvey was traveling by himself and Kato was
working as a diving coach there.</P>
      <P>They later traveled extensively around the world, including in Central  America
where they learned  about the ancient Mayan civilization, as well as in Africa's
Egypt, and Asia's Cambodia, Laos, and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The couple later visited Taiwan, where they came across the Penghu archipelago.</P>
      <P>They thought it was just a midway station for them but it has turned out to be
the place where they stayed the longest time so far on their journey.</P>
      <P>Kato told CNA in an interview that the reason she and her husband decided to
settle in Penghu was because they love Penghu's "Shanshuei Beach, " the famous
white sandy beach that is over 200 meters long, located at Penghu's village of
"Shanshuei."</P>
      <P>Harvey said Penghu has many beautiful beaches, but the "Shanshuei Beach" is the
quietest one and also the cleanest. The beach is a must-see for visitors to
Penghu, known for its clean and white sand and bright sunshine.</P>
      <P>Penghu County, consisting of 64 islands, is roughly located midway between
Taiwan and China on the Taiwan Strait. The islands have a total land area of 127
square kilometers and a combined coastline of some 320 kilometers in length.</P>
      <P>The couple live a quiet but joyful life. Every afternoon after Harvey is free
from teaching, he goes home where Kato and the Japanese dishes she made are
awaiting him. They would go for a walk with their black puppy on the beach under
the sun or jog on the country roads filled with firewheel flowers.</P>
      <P>While it's the first time the couple is living in Taiwan, Kato said she has some
connection with the island nation. Her grandfather lived in southern Taiwan 64
years ago when he worked for the Japanese colonial government.</P>
      <P>The connection comes in pairs as Harvey said Taiwan's political situation of
striving for independence gives him a familiar feeling because  his hometown
Quebec  Province  also has long sought independence.</P>
      <P>The couple plans to leave their home in Penghu for a while in the summer to
travel to India, Nepal, and Tibet, for Kato has been learning Tibetan Buddhism.</P>
      <P>"We will also visit Dharamsala where the Tibetan Government in Exile is based,
and hopefully we'll get to see Dalai Lama, " Kato said, adding that if someday
they decide it is time to leave Penghu, Tibet will be the next destination.</P>
      <P>When they are too old to travel, the couple will return to Harvey's hometown and
stay for the rest of their life, Kato said.</P>
      <P>Asked if she misses her family in Nagoya, Kato said she seldom gets
homesickness.</P>
      <P>"Perhaps because it is my nature to live the traveling life or because the world
outside my hometown is too beautiful," Kato said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that the Ministry of Education will
reserve 1 percent of its college enrollments to foreign students, to make it
easier for students from abroad to pursue higher education in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"By reserving 1 percent of our college enrollments, presently numbering around
1.3 million, Taiwan will have a better chance of acquiring academic talent and
people with higher intelligence from abroad, " Ma said during a colloquium with
a group of educators from southern Taiwan held in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Ma and Vice President-elect Vincent Siew traveled to Kaohsiung that day to meet
with education representatives from southern Taiwan to gauge their opinions
about the country's education policy, in a bid to allow the incoming Ma
administration to craft better and more pragmatic education policies.</P>
      <P>Speaking after talking with the educators, Ma said most of the officials, from
schools of various levels, lamented about budget insufficiency.</P>
      <P>In response  to the  educators'  questions,  Ma said  his administration will
increase the education budget by 0.2 percent of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) annually, equalling about NT$24 billion (US$792.08 million) a
year, or nearly NT$200 billion in eight years.</P>
      <P>Answering questions about Taiwan's possible opening to Chinese students to study
at local colleges and universities and allowing Chinese people with Chinese
academic credentials to take part in local license accreditation tests, Ma said
firmly that he will not allow such people to take part in local license
accreditation tests.</P>
      <P>"Chinese students will be welcome to study at local colleges and universities,
but they will not be allowed to take part in local license accreditation tests,
because such tests are open only to Taiwan citizens who are Republic of China
passport holders, " Ma noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan might request WTO arbitration on EU import duty on LCDs</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 27 (CNA)
04/27/08  17:36:31
(By Neil Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is considering requesting the World Trade Organization (WTO) to
investigate and rule on a European Union tariff on imported liquid crystal
displays (LCDs) , which Taiwan alleges is in contravention of the Information
Technology Agreement (ITA), a high-ranking trade official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The EU has imposed a 14 percent import duty on LCDs of over 19 inches, claiming
that they are electric appliances. However, the U.S. and Taiwan insist that the
LCDs are IT products covered by the ITA and should enjoy "duty free" treatment.</P>
      <P>U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab has threatened publicly to bring the case
to the WTO and the U.S. also hopes that Taiwan, the world's no. 1 LCD producer,
will join the legal battle against the EU.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's LCD trade union also filed a complaint with the government that their
exports are unjustly levied by the EU, and asked for assistance.</P>
      <P>John Deng,  chief representative  of the Office  of Trade Negotiations under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), confirmed Sunday that Taiwan is conducting
what he called "thorough and comprehensive evaluation" of the case and does not
rule out the possibility of triggering the trade dispute settlement mechanism of
the WTO.</P>
      <P>But the top trade negotiator stressed that they would be "extremely careful" in
the decision-making process, since the case could very well become Taiwan's
first trade litigation in the WTO and involves huge commercial and trade
interests.</P>
      <P>According to official tallies, the EU collected as much as NT$19.6 billion
(US$650 million) in import duty from Taiwanese LCD exports, valued at NT$140
billion.</P>
      <P>Deng also noted that LCDs are one of Taiwan's most import IT products and said
that "the government bears unavoidable responsibility to use all possible tools
to protect our industry and trade interests."</P>
      <P>The WTO's trade dispute settlement procedure, often regarded as "the world court
of trade," is vital for enforcing the rules and therefore for ensuring that
trade flows smoothly. But Taiwan has never been a party to any trade dispute,
except for participating in other members' litigation as a third party.</P>
      <P>"Bringing the case to the WTO is not a goal but a last resort, " explained Deng,
expressing hope that the EU will abide by the ITA to avoid WTO proceedings,
which takes at least a year for a preliminary ruling and another three months
should the ruling be appealed. More often than not, however, cases drag on for
years without any final settlement.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei city councilor urged the government Saturday to tackle the noise and
environmental pollution caused by pigeons, which she said has "severely
endangered" the health and living quality of the residents of the Daan Public
Housing project.</P>
      <P>"The seemingly-harmless pigeons, which come in flocks to nest on the eaves, have
become a nightmare for the people living here, " according to opposition
Kuomintang Taipei City Councilor Lin Yi-hua.</P>
      <P>She said the pigeons nesting on the buildings come mainly from the nearby Daan
Forest Park and that their droppings pose a great health hazard to the elderly
and children. "Every pigeon produces 12 kg of droppings per year," she said.</P>
      <P>"Research shows that pigeon feces contain crypotococcus, a kind of fungus that
can cause pneumonia or meningitis, " said Wong Wing-wai, director of the
Division for Disease Control and Prevention under the Taipei city government's
Department of Health.</P>
      <P>"People with weak immune systems, such as the elderly and children, are the most
susceptible," he added.</P>
      <P>Residents in the area said the problem has been there for over 20 years but
nothing has been done by the government to help them get rid of the birds.</P>
      <P>"Every day at around 5 a.m. we are wakened by the pigeons, which is really
disturbing," said Chow Yin-hua, an elderly resident.</P>
      <P>"Their feces are not only smelly but also impossible to clean, as they are on
unreachable windowsill or eaves outside the house, " she added.</P>
      <P>The residents said the city government should eradicate the pigeons.</P>
      <P>"Strategies like spikes and nets have had little success and most of us can only
passively clean up the mess created by the birds and tolerate them day after
day," said Chow.</P>
      <P>Lin said the government should begin by making feeding the pigeons illegal so
that it might reduce the number of pigeons in the area.</P>
      <P>She added that some cities in the United States, such as Los Angeles, have tried
to cut their pigeon populations by lacing rooftop feeders with drugs that
prevent the birds from breeding.</P>
      <P>The contraceptive drug, OvoControl P,  interferes with egg production and should
therefore keep the population down without the need for poison or gates that
give electric shocks, according to a report from the New York Times.</P>
      <P>"Every big city, such as New York and London, has a pigeon problem like this.
The Taipei city government should begin to take this issue seriously as
currently there are no effective measures or restrictions," Lin said.</P>
      <P>She said the government should refer to what has been done in other cities and
draw up a comprehensive plan to tackle the problem.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Eight scuba divers still missing</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Pingtung County,  southern Taiwan,  April 27 (CNA)
04/27/08  18:42:10

    <TEXT>
      <P>An air and sea search for eight missing scuba divers continued for the second
day Sunday in seas around Taiwan's southern tip, but failed to find any trace of
survivors.</P>
      <P>The search mission comprised seven cutters of the Coast Guard Administration
(CGA) , six helicopters dispatched by the National Airborne Service Corps, and
two sport fishing boats hired by the divers' families.</P>
      <P>They searched the seas east of Taitung, as well as the seas west of Pingtung and
Kaohsiung, but to no avail. Hsu Yung-kang, a deputy leader of the CGA detachment
on the Hengchun peninsula, said the ocean currents were moving in a
northeasterly direction between Saturday and Friday morning and that the search
mission would continue, with the emphasis on the seas east of southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The families of the holidaymaking divers were angry early Sunday when harbor
security authorities at Houbihu, the largest fishing port in Hengchun, forbade
them from going to sea on two hired fishing boats because they are not licensed
crewmen. They then hired two sport fishing boats to join the search.</P>
      <P>The eight missing divers -- six men and two women -- went missing a day earlier
while scuba diving in waters near Chihsingyen (seven-star rocks) -- located 22
km southwest of Eluanbi, the southernmost tip of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They were identified as Hung Yu-sheng, 29; Ting Po-ling, 32; Wang Chih-yu, 25;
Wang Shun-ping, 28; Tu Ting-chang, 38; Kuo Chun-hsien, 38; Lee Su-ling, 44; and
Liu Hui-chun, 28.</P>
      <P>CGA teams from Pingtung and neighboring Kaohsiung County, as well as an airborne
rescue squad, launched a sea and air search after four of the divers' friends
and the skipper of their dive boat reported that the eight divers had failed to
return to the boat at 11:30 a.m. Saturday after an hour-long dive.</P>
      <P>The sea around Seven Stars is loved by scuba divers because the coral reefs
there are unpolluted and full of tropical marine life, but the site is also
notoriously dangerous because of the strong currents due to the black tide, also
known as the Kuroshio Current.</P>
      <P>Experts in the diving trade said high winds and rough seas Saturday might have
also contributed to the tidal action and they said a strong current could have
swept them farther out to sea.</P>

      <P>The Songshan Tsuyou temple launched the 2008 Sikou Culture Festival for the
third consecutive year Sunday, featuring a series of events combining history,
culture, the environment and Mother's Day to promote the unique and distinctive
tradition of the riverside area.</P>
      <P>"River, Mother and Love is the theme of this year's festival. We hope the two-
week festival will increase the depth of local culture and awaken local
residents' memories and love for the area, " said Yu Shu-yi, director of Taipei
City's Songshan District Office.</P>
      <P>"We also hope to promote the visibility of Songshan district to attract more
tourists, " she said, adding that this is the perfect timing for the event as
the Tsuyou temple is celebrating its 255th anniversary and Matzu's birthday.
Matzu is the most important folk deity in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu noted that there are several meanings of this year's event, in which
environmental protection plays an important part, as the Songshan area was
developed because it is adjacent to the Keelung river.</P>
      <P>Songshan  was  originally  named  Sikou,  which  is  the Taiwanese-language
pronunciation of a lowland aboriginal Ketagalan word meaning "where the river
twists." In 1920, the area became known as Songshan village and later was merged
with Taipei City in 1938.</P>
      <P>"The Keelung river is the mother of Songshan, so as we celebrate the May 11
Mother's Day, we would like take the opportunity to remind everyone that it is
important to keep the river clean so that we can enjoy ourselves along the
riverside," she said.</P>
      <P>Songshan Community College Director Tsai Su-chen said the event is more than an
annual carnival.</P>
      <P>"It has multiple meanings, such as education, culture and eco-conservation,"
Tsai said. "We hope bonding among residents will be cemented even further by the
warm atmosphere and that people will be drawn to experience the distinctive
cultural ambiance," she added.</P>
      <P>Organized by the Songshan District Office, the Songshan Tsuyu temple, Songshan
Community College and the Civil Affairs Bureau, the 2008 Sikou Culture Festival
will feature a series of activities including traditional Chinese theatrical
operas, concerts and food fairs before it ends May 10.</P>

      <P>The chairman-designate of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) has
promised to push for the SEF and China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) to serve as a negotiation platform to facilitate the
peaceful development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, who is also a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
made the remarks Saturday at a reception in China's southeastern coastal city of
Xiamen in Fujian Province to thank Taiwanese businessmen operating in the area
on behalf of KMT President-elect Ma Ying-jeou for their support in the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the KMT will fulfill all the campaign promises made by the KMT
ticket during the campaign period, particularly on cross-strait issues -- with
which China-based Taiwanese businessmen are most concerned -- including the
establishment of direct flights and the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>He pledged that if the SEF becomes the government's negotiation platform for the
implementation of cross-strait affairs, it will first take into consideration
the rights of Taiwanese businessmen in China, while seeking to promote cross-
strait economic and trade exchanges, develop Taiwan's economy and boost cross-
strait relations.</P>
      <P>Once the negotiation mechanism is initiated, the agency will give priority to
addressing issues concerning double taxation, investment protection for the
interests of Taiwanese businessmen and investment in China by Taiwan's banking
industry, Chiang noted.</P>
      <P>The agency will also assist Taiwanese investors in industrial upgrading to
increase their competitiveness in China.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations set up by Taipei and Beijing,
respectively, to handle cross-strait affairs in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>In 1993, SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan met in
Singapore for the first cross-strait talks in over four decades. They met again
in October 1998 in Shanghai, but the negotiations were suspended by Beijing
after then-President Lee Teng-hui described  the cross-strait  situation  as a
"special state-to-state relationship" in 1999.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>From scratch to a nearly full-fledged legal team, the Office of Trade
Negotiations (OTN) has achieved in eight months something that has been
requested, studied,  and discussed for years.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, John Deng, chief representative of the OTN under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, said Sunday that his team has already demonstrated
its ability to fulfill the tasks of providing legal analysis and opinion, and
eventually engaging in legal disputes under the World Trade Organization (WTO)
framework in the very near future, although it might not be able to
independently conduct a complete international trade legal proceeding just yet.</P>
      <P>Legal counsel could be the weakest aspect in Taiwan's public institutions.
Unlike developed countries,  almost none of the ministries in Taiwan's central
government have a competent and specialized legal office, except for the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ) . The problem surfaced in 2002 when Taiwan joined the
WTO, in which dispute settlement is a central pillar.</P>
      <P>Even with the urgent demand, the legal team of the OTN was not established until
August last year on an ad hoc basis with two legal experts on loan from the MOJ.</P>
      <P>Aiming at promoting ability in international trade disputes and negotiations,
such as free trade agreements (FTAs) , the country's first-ever international
legal force has made impressive progress with limited resources, according to
Deng.</P>
      <P>The team is led by a negotiator in charge of legal affairs and rules, along with
six members -- three middle-level officials and three legal assistants.</P>
      <P>The  backbone  of  the  middle-level  officials  are  two prosecutors-turned-
legal advisors, tasked with providing analyses and advises on rights and
obligations under the multilateral trading system and international trade
agreements, and helping solve trade disputes under such agreements.</P>
      <P>Deng said the prosecutors' legal and trial skills and expertise will ensure the
quality of their work.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has not been in the position of plaintiff or defendant in any
trade dispute as a WTO member state -- partly due to lack of legal capacity --
the office is developing the team by submitting cases involving other countries
as a third party.</P>
      <P>To date, the team has accomplished five submissions in eight months, a massive
jump against the seven submitted in the previous five years. In addition to
quantity, Deng said the quality of those submissions is well-recognized.</P>
      <P>Chen Chern-chyi, a negotiator in legal affairs and rules, praised the team,
saying that the prosecutors have adapted to a lonelier job without the media
spotlight -- something they were used to as criminal prosecutors.</P>
      <P>"On top of that, they are very passionate toward the work, and have been
learning about WTO issues from the ground up," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Citing the difficulties of the unprecedented tasks, Deng said the team still
needs to consult with WTO experts to fully capture the complexity of
international trade disputes.</P>
      <P>He went on that in the long run, the team could be refined as a central force
for Taiwan to independently solve the legal problems arising from external
trade.</P>
      <P>But the legal team faces an uncertain future as it is not a permanent office,
and Deng expressed hope that it can become a regular unit in the government
system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Group reveals job plight of immigrant women in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

      <P>Job discrimination, having to work multiple jobs, no labor insurance, no
overtime pay and low wages are the five major plights faced by most working
women who have immigrated from Southeast Asia to Taiwan, a local activist group
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The findings are the result of a series of one-on-one interviews conducted by
the Taiwan International Family Association (TIFA) between February and April
with 75 Southeast Asian women married to Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>Although Southeast Asian spouses of Taiwanese citizens do not require a work
permit, the association found that local employers often refuse to hire
immigrant women on the grounds that they lack a work permit or national ID card,
or that they speak poor Chinese.</P>
      <P>"We speak Chinese with an accent, but we deserve an opportunity to demonstrate
our working ability, " said Yeh Pei-chi, a Thai woman who married a Taiwanese
citizen 13 years ago.</P>
      <P>"If we are proven incapable, then don't hire us, but don't refuse to hire us
simply because we are foreigners, " Yeh said.</P>
      <P>She recalled that she was once rejected by a factory employer who told her that
"we don't hire foreign spouses, " a common example of job discrimination
experienced by many female immigrant workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For her part, Ruan Fan Chiu-hsiang from Vietnam said she has helped her
Taiwanese husband to recycle metal since the day after she arrived in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She said she had no experience at the time, often made mistakes and got laughed
at by others.</P>
      <P>In addition, the association discovered that 72 percent of the women interviewed
do not have the labor insurance to which they are entitled, while 68 percent
work overtime without overtime pay, said Wang Shu-chuan, executive secretary of
the association.</P>
      <P>Among those who said they receive overtime pay, only 14 percent are paid an
amount that meets the requirements of the Labor Standards Law, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The association also observed that half of the immigrant women in the southern
port city of Kaohsiung need to have multiple jobs to support their families,
many of them working in restaurants or breakfast shops, she noted.</P>
      <P>In northern Taiwan, most of the women work unusual shifts from 3 p.m. to 2 p.m.,
she continued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, only 57 percent of the females surveyed earn a total monthly income
higher than the basic monthly wage of NT$17,280 (about US$570) as required by
the government, even though many of them work extra hours to earn higher
salaries, Wang pointed out.</P>
      <P>Calling for greater attention to job discrimination and the predicaments faced
by immigrant women in Taiwan, Wang said the Council of Labor Affairs and local
governments should raise the awareness of immigrants' working rights and related
rules among local employers and immigrants.</P>
      <P>Chang Yu-hua, executive director of the association, described female immigrants
in Taiwan as "new low-level workers, " as many of them work as restaurant staff,
household maids, or small factory workers.</P>
      <P>Immigrant women need to learn local languages and adapt to a new environment but
do not have strong emotional support as they do not have many family members and
friends in Taiwan, Chang added, urging the public to offer care and help.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has more than 123,000 foreign spouses from Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand,
the Philippines and Cambodia, as well as over 270,000 from China, Japan and
South Korea.</P>

      <P>Lions Clubs International District 300-D2 donated Sunday a fully equipped pap
smear screening vehicle to the Kaohsiung county government that will tour the
southern county to provide women in remote areas with easy access to cervical
cancer screening.</P>
      <P>The vehicle,  equipped  with a full set of advanced  and sophisticated medical
instruments, is first in county to be equipped with an ultrasound breast
screening device.</P>
      <P>Yu Chien-chang, head of the Lions group, presented the vehicle to Kaohsiung
Deputy Magistrate Yeh Nan-ming.</P>
      <P>The vehicle, designed to perform breast, cervical and colerectal cancer
screening and bone density measurements, will travel to remote areas  in the
county  with  the aim of increasing  screening participation of local women, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>Cervical cancer is one of the top causes of cancer death in women in Taiwan,
causing the death of some 1,000 women each year, Yeh said, adding that women are
strongly advised to get regular pap smears, as the test is the most effective
cancer screening tool.</P>
      <P>According to a survey released by the Department of Health, both the incidence
and the death rate for cervical cancer could drop by 60 percent-90 percent for
women who get pap smears every three years, Yeh added.</P>

here Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung,  deputy  executive-director  of KMT Policy Committee, said the
two communication channels will exist together and help each other in cementing
ties between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang arrived here Sunday in company with KMT Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kung to
thank local Taiwan businesspeople for their support for the KMT presidential
candidate Ma Ying-jeou and his running mate Vincent Siew in the March 20

      <P>Chiang has been named by President-elect Ma Ying-jeou as chairman of the Strait

counterparts on behalf of the Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>It's an arm of the government, and its any agreement with Beijing have to be
approved by the government and made into law before taking force, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT-CPC forum, established in 2005 by CPC General Secretary Hu
Jintao and then-KMT Chairman Lien Chan is a place for business leaders,
academics, government officials even leaders of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive

      <P>The forum will also help build consensus among its participants and these
consensus may be translated into policies of Beijing and Taipei, Chang went on.</P>
      <P>Although President-elect Ma Ying-jeou has said that contacts with China under

      <P>The CGA had launched an air and sea search for the eight divers Saturday after
they went missing in seas near Chihsingyen (seven-star rocks), 22 km southwest
of Oluanbi on the southernmost tip of Taiwan, which is known for its turbulent
ocean currents.</P>
      <P>There was no sign of the divers until late Sunday night when dive coach Ting Po-
ling swam ashore at 11: 50 p.m. Sunday to a beach in Taimali in the eastern
county of Taitung.</P>
      <P>Ting immediately alerted the rescue teams which began searching the nearby
coastal area and soon scooped up four other divers from the waters off Taimali
around midnight.</P>
      <P>The four were spotted in pitch dark water because their flashed their torches,
according to the crew of a helicopter mobilized by the Pingtung air base, who
rescued the four divers.</P>
      <P>At 5: 50 a.m. Monday, the rescuers spotted another missing diver on the beach.</P>
      <P>Continuing the search, the rescuers found the last two divers -- Lee Su-ling and
Wang Chih-yu -- near the Taitung coast at around 11 a.m. Monday, successfully
wrapping up the daunting task of finding all eight divers alive 47 hours after
the search began.</P>
      <P>The search  mission  --  comprised  of seven  Coast Guard Administration (CGA)
cutters, six National Airborne Service Corps helicopters, and two sport fishing
boats hired by the divers' families -- did not spot any survivors until last
Saturday night.</P>
      <P>For several hours, they searched the seas east of Taitun and west of Pingtung
and Kaohsiung -- two neighboring southern counties -- to no avail. Hsu Yung-
kang, a deputy leader of the CGA detachment on the Hengchun peninsula, said
Sunday that the ocean currents had been moving in a northeasterly direction
since Friday morning and that the search mission would continue, focusing on the
area east of southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The eight divers were declared missing after they failed to return to their boat
at 11:30 a.m. Saturday after an hour-long dive.</P>
      <P>The waters around Chihsingyen are a favorite of scuba divers because of the
coral reefs there that are unpolluted and full of tropical marine life. But the
site is also notoriously dangerous because of the strong currents due to the
black tide, also known as the Kuroshio Current.</P>
      <P>Diving experts said high winds and rough seas Saturday might also have
contributed to the tidal action and that a strong current could have swept the
divers farther out to sea.</P>

      <P>Former opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Legislator Lai Hsing-yuan was
named chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) by Premier-designate Liu
Chao-shiuan Monday.</P>
      <P>Lai, 52, who holds a doctorate in research and development from the University
of Sussex, UK, and was a TSU legislator between 2005-2007, was among 18 people
named Monday by Liu in the second batch of members of the new Cabinet slated to
be inaugurated May 20.</P>
      <P>Some legislators of the incoming Kuomintang (KMT) expressed misgivings over
Lai's inclusion in the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chiu Yi was obviously displeased  with the appointment, saying
that naming Lai, a protege of former President Lee Teng-hui, as Taiwan's top
mainland policy planner indicated a reinstatement of the "Lee Teng-hui political
line."</P>
      <P>Lee, the spiritual leader of the TSU, was seen as aggravating cross-strait
tensions in the late 1990s when he described cross Taiwan Strait relations as a
special state-to-state relationship. His 1995 visit to the United States during
his presidential tenure also was a source of ire to Beijing, which saw the trip
as aimed at promoting Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Chiu further said that the appointment of Lai, who to some extent represents the
pro-independence influence, is tantamount to "eating pork in front of Muslims."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chang Hsien-yao argued that Lai's appointment is not conducive to
the development of cross-strait relations, adding that he would not be
optimistic about cross-strait relations after May 20 with Lai in charge of

      <P>Premier-designate  Liu Chao-shiuan completed the assignment of Cabinet members
for financial and economic affairs Monday, naming Lee Shu-te and Gordon Chen to
lead the Ministry of Finance (MOF)  and the Financial  Supervisory Commission
(FSC), respectively.</P>
      <P>The incoming Kuomintang (KMT) government, which is set to take office May 20
from the Democratic Progressive Party, will face a number of financial and
economic challenges, including inflation, a second phase of financial reforms,
the government deficit and revitalization of cross-Taiwan Strait economic and
trade ties.</P>
      <P>Along with last week's designations of Paul Chiu as vice premier, Yin Chi-ming
as minister of economic affairs, and Chen Tain-jy as commissioner of the Council
for Economic Planning and Development, Liu's announcement completed the new
administration's  team of decision makers and executors for Taiwan's fractured
economy.</P>
      <P>Referring to the qualities of the finance minister-designate, Liu said that Lee,
the incumbent secretary-general of the Taipei city government and a former
commissioner of the city government's Department of Finance, has accomplished a
score of tasks involving tax policies and the government deficit.</P>
      <P>Lee, whose previous financial administration experience also includes a stint as
director-general of the Kaohsiung National Tax Administration under the MOF,
previously played a crucial role as a financial planner during President-elect
Ma Ying-jeou's eight years as Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>An expert on tax policy with a complete record in financial administration and
an MBA, Lee has helped Taipei to create tax income by attracting private
investment in property in the city's Xinyi district.</P>
      <P>Experts said the major challenges ahead of Lee in his MOF post are tax reforms
and the reduction of the government deficit.</P>

      <P>Premier-designate  Liu Chao-shiuan announced Monday another 18 members of his
cabinet, including Lai Shin-yuan,  a former legislator of the pro-independence
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), as chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), a surprise appointment that sparked wide debates and some opposition.</P>
      <P>The decision to name Lai as head of the cross-strait policy making governmental
agency drew disparaging comments from some Kuomintang (KMT) legislators, while a
group of Kuomintang (KMT) supporters gathered outside the venue of Monday's
press conference shouting for Liu to step down.</P>
      <P>The protestors argued that Lai is not a member of the KMT nor does she have the
required experience in dealing directly with Beijing to hold such a post.</P>
      <P>Liu, however, noted that the selection of the MAC chairperson was initiated by
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou and that Lai is "qualified for the position on the
basis of her past experience in dealing with mainland affairs as well as her
educational background."</P>
      <P>Lai holds a master's degree in International Relations and a doctorate in
Development Studies -- both earned in the United Kingdo m. She has served as
Taiwan's negotiator for World Trade Organization accession, as a member of the
National Security Council, a legislator, and a university research fellow.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the protesters would be more accepting of Lai's appointment if
they were aware of her qualifications and her support for Ma and Siew's mainland
policy.</P>
      <P>"Lai identifies with the mainland policy of Ma and Vice President-elect Vincent
Siew, " Liu stressed. "She will no longer be involved in the administration of
the TSU."</P>
      <P>Lai later confirmed Liu's statement, saying that her approach to mainland
affairs was "the same as Ma's." She gave the assurance that she will cooperate
with Ma on issues that are in the interest of the Taiwanese people and will
maintain Taiwan's dignity. Lai made the comments during a press conference held
by the TSU via telephone following Liu's announcement.</P>
      <P>"The priority of the MAC head is to coordinate various positions and opinions,"
Lai said, adding that a gradual development of cross-strait relations would be
one of the components of her policy."</P>
      <P>"The goal of Taiwan's mainland policy is to maintain cross-strait stability and
promote peace in East Asia," Lai added.</P>
      <P>Addressing concerns about her competence to hold the post, Lai said that "the
job would be a challenge for me... and there are still many misunderstandings."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning has said the Nankang Software Park's
performance in a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit shows that the
government's efforts to promote innovation and the development of knowledge
economy clusters has borne fruit.</P>
      <P>The  Economist  Intelligence  Unit  survey  looked  at the effectiveness of four
software parks in Asia -- including Cyberjaya in Malaysia, Dalian Software Park
in China and Quang Trung Software City in Vietnam -- in promoting start-ups and
domestic software firms, and the extent to which they foster innovation.</P>
      <P>In the survey released in March, Nankang Software Park was found to have the
highest survival rate for start-up businesses more than two years old, at 80
percent.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said that promoting "knowledge clustering" is one of the major keys to
success for industries and that Taiwan's efforts at cluster development and
innovation have received affirmation from international organizations.</P>
      <P>The council noted that Taiwan ranked first in the world in terms of the state of
cluster development in the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness report
for 2006 and 2007.</P>
      <P>The performance of companies that have set up shop in Taiwan's Hsinchu Science
Park, Central Taiwan Science Park and Southern Taiwan Science Park provide
further proof that the government's cluster development policy has been
successful, the CEDP said.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that the total turnover of businesses located in the three parks
amounted to NT$1.9664 trillion (US$64.69 billion) for 2007, up 12.3 percent over
the previous year's figure.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the three science parks' exports amounted to NT$1.2376 trillion for
2007, marking a steep year-on-year increase of 15.6 percent, the CEDP said. The
science parks' exports for last year represented a whopping 15.3 percent of
Taiwan's total exports, it added.</P>
      <P>The Economist Intelligence Unit said in its survey that besides having a
survival rate of 80 percent for start-ups less than two years old, the Nankang
Software Park's occupancy rate stands at "an enviable 98 percent."</P>
      <P>The Nankang Software Park, which opened in 1999 on the outskirts of Taipei City,
is now in its third phase of expansion, focusing on specific market niches of
integrated-circuit (IC) design, digital content and biotechnology. It is
Taiwan's largest software park.</P>
      <P>The software park, along with the nearby Neihu Science Park and Taipei Tech
Park, forms part of Taiwan's high-tech corridor which extends to the Hsinchu
Science Park located about 75 kilometers southeast of Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said that in order to boost Taiwan's industrial competitiveness in the
international market, the government will continue cultivating and upgrading
high-technology clusters to help create more job opportunities and to serve as
an engine for economic growth.</P>

      <P>Huang Pi-tuan, a former president of the Tainan National University of the Arts
in southern Taiwan, was named minister in charge of the Council for Cultural
Affairs (CCA) Monday by Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>Huang, also a noted columnist and essayist who writes on education, culture and
social phenomena, said upon the appointment that since culture is relevant to
everyone and cultural development encompasses every aspect of society, she will
endeavor to bolster progress in all cultural sectors, including education, media
and tourism, after assuming office May 20.</P>
      <P>Huang, 63, who graduated from National Taiwan University's Department of
Political Science and its graduate school, also holds a doctorate in literature
from the University of Wisconsin.</P>
      <P>She was hired as a director of the Department of Foreign Language at National
Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan soon after returning from
the United States.</P>
      <P>In 1992, she became deputy director in charge of management of the National
Theater and the National Concert Hall.</P>
      <P>Three years later, she was invited by National Chi Nan University in Nantou,
central Taiwan to organize the establishment of a foreign language department
there.</P>
      <P>Huang became president of the Tainan National University of the Arts in 2004,
eventually turning the university into a mecca for arts studies in southern
Taiwan. Students at the university have often won prizes in international
competitions relating to the arts and multimedia design.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Huang is also a renowned columnist for several major daily
newspapers in Taiwan, impressing readers with her insightful and inspirational
essays.</P>
      <P>Talking to CNA after she was named CCA head, Huang said she supports the idea of
expanding the CCA into a ministry of tourism and cultural affairs, as culture is
one of the key elements of tourism, particularly in this day and age, when more
and more people are making frequent sightseeing trips at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>"Culture plays a key role in the efforts of a country or a place to allow its
unique characteristics or beauty to be appreciated," she noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier-designate  Liu Chao-shiuan announced Monday another 18 members of his
cabinet, including the heads of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the
ministries of education, national defense, and finance.</P>
      <P>Liu, accompanied by Vice Premier-designate Paul Chiu at a press conference,
named Lai Shin-yuan, a former Taiwan Solidarity Union(TSU) legislator, as MAC
chairwoman; Cheng Jei-Cheng, former president of National Chengchi University,
as education minister; Chen Chao-ming as minister of national defense; and Lee
Sush-der, incumbent secretary-general of the Taipei City Government, as finance
minister.</P>
      <P>Despite protests over Lai's appointment among Kuomintang (KMT) supporters who
gathered outside the venue of Monday's press conference, Liu stressed that Lai
is qualified to hold the position, given her past experience in dealing with
mainland affairs and her educational background.</P>
      <P>"Lai identifies with the mainland policy of Ma and Vice President-elect Vincent
Siew, " Liu said. "She will no longer be involved in the administration of the
TSU."</P>
      <P>Regarding his choice of education minister, Liu described Cheng as "a
disciplined gentleman and a caring and patient educator."</P>
      <P>"Cheng is concerned not only about higher education, but also about elementary
and high school education, " Liu said, adding that he hoped Cheng will "set up a
multi-dimensional education ministry with emphasis on humanism."</P>
      <P>Noting that the lack of a communication channel between the government and
parents has caused problems in education policy, Liu promised that Cheng will
also build "a systematic, permanent, and open platform" for dialogue to improve
the education system.</P>
      <P>Liu also announced the new heads of the National Science Council, the
Government  Information  Office,  the  Central  Personnel Administration, the
Sports Affairs Council, the Finance Supervisory Commission, and the National
Palace Museum.</P>
      <P>Rebutting criticisms that his Cabinet is comprised of too many former KMT
government officials, Liu said the administration will be a "mixture of old
hands and new blood."</P>
      <P>"We will not have inexperienced people dealing with the many urgent issues --
there is no time for greenhorns to learn" on the job, Liu said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that "old hands are the best," but gave the assurance that his
administration will also continue its efforts to "groom rookies who are
competent and honest."</P>
      <P>So far, Liu has named 35 members of the KMT cabinet, with announcements yet to
be made for the posts of one minister without portfolio, the head of the
Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission, and the governors of the Taiwan and
Fujian Provinces.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) under its oversight are the only official agencies in charge of
holding cross-Taiwan Strait talks, President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the
Kuomintang (KMT) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while answering reporters' questions at the KMT headquarters
after KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan departed for Beijing on a private visit
earlier the same day. Lien is slated to meet Chinese President Hu Jintao during
the tour -- the fourth such meeting between the two men.</P>
      <P>Asked whether any agreement reached in talks between Lien and Hu would influence
policies of the incoming KMT government, to be inaugurated on May 20, Ma made it
clear that only the MAC and SEF are authorized to represent the government in
entering into negotiations with the Chinese side.</P>
      <P>In line with the government system, the MAC is in charge of devising Taiwan's
China policy, while the SEF is commissioned by the MAC to execute cross-strait
technical issues, Ma explained.</P>
      <P>However, Ma noted that regarding private exchanges between the two sides, the
government is not entitled to impose any restrictions on such activities as long
as they are lawful.</P>
      <P>In essence, cross-strait policies must be made and carried out by the MAC and
SEF, respectively, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Accompanied  by Minister  without  Portfolio-designate  Tsai Hsung-hsiung, KMT
Vice Chairman Lin Feng-cheng, former Vice Premier Hsu Li-teh, several
entrepreneurs and his wife, Lien left for China via Hong Kong on Monday. He is
scheduled to visit Beijing, as well as Chongqing in Sichuan Province and Wuhan
in Hubei Province.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he will exchange views with Hu on cross-Taiwan Strait activities,
Lien refused to comment.</P>
      <P>He also declined to offer his opinion on the appointment of Lai Hsing-yuan,  a
former lawmaker of the pro-independence  Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , as
chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council -- the government's top
agency in planning Taiwan's China policy.</P>
      <P>Lai's appointment to the key post has sparked criticism across Taiwan's
political spectrum because of her pro-independence stance in the past.</P>
      <P>Lien first visited China and met Hu in Beijing in 2005 -- the most high profile
and high level contact between the civil rivals, the KMT and the Communist Party
of China, since 1949. During that trip, Lien and Hu signed an agreement to step
up two-way exchanges between the two parties.</P>

      <P>The newly named minister of education, Cheng Jei-cheng, said Monday that he will
invite representatives of teachers' and parents' groups over the next few days
for talks in an effort to find out what they expect for elementary and high
school education.</P>
      <P>Cheng, a former president of National Chengchi University in Taipei, is on a
second namelist of incoming Cabinet members, which Premier-designate Liu Chao-
shiuan announced earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Cheng, whom Liu described as "a self-disciplined gentleman and a caring educator
with patience," told reporters he believes "education must be forward-looking."</P>
      <P>He also expressed hope that the media will refrain from comparing him with other
ministers of education.</P>
      <P>The selection of incoming education minister has been a hot topic since
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou named Liu to take the helm of the Executive Yuan in
early April. Many people, parents and teachers in particular, have high
expectations for new minister as educational reforms attempted over the past
decade have been roundly criticized.</P>
      <P>Cheng, born in Yilan, northeastern Taiwan, in 1946, graduated from Chengchi
University's Department of Journalism in 1969.</P>
      <P>With a doctoral degree in communications  from Ohio State University, Cheng
served as head of Chengchi University's Department of Journalism and College of
Communications before being elected president of the university in 2000.</P>
      <P>Chen held the post for five years and nine months until he quit in October 2006,
three months before the end of his second term, a move he made to allow his
successor to assume the office during the school vacation to minimize any
disruption resulting from the handover.</P>
      <P>Described as a "philosopher university president," Cheng is known for his gentle
character and a "moderate" working style. In the days before he stepped down, he
said jokingly that in his life, he has "never done what he wants to do, but
instead has done what he doesn't want to do, "</P>
      <P>In an interview published in 2006 in the Evaluation Bimonthly of the Higher
Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council, Cheng recalled that he had
wanted to work as a journalist after graduating from Chengchi University, but
changed his career path shortly after taking a job as a reporter because "the
media environment was not good" in those days.</P>
      <P>In response to Liu's naming of Cheng as education minister, the National
Teachers'  Association  (NTA)  said it respects  the designation, but it also
expressed concern that Cheng might have little knowledge of elementary and
middle school education.</P>
      <P>In a statement, the NTA expressed hopes that Cheng will "make up his missing
lessons" as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The organization also said Cheng's first task after taking office May 20 should
be to select a deputy "in a cautious manner, " the statement said, adding that
he should be willing to take advice from various education circles.</P>
      <P>Speaking of his choice, Liu said Cheng "is concerned not only about higher
education but also about elementary and high school education.  " He added that
he expects  Cheng  to set up a multi-dimensional ministry with an emphasis on
humanism.</P>

      <P>Kao was among 18 people named Monday by Liu in the second round of appointments
for the Cabinet which is slated to be inaugurated May 20.</P>
      <P>Kao, 62, born in the Chinese province of Shandong, was the VAC head between May
2004 and February 2007.</P>
      <P>A seasoned veteran and a graduate of the R.O.C. Military Academy, Kao has held
many important military positions, including deputy commander of an Army group,
director of the Combined Warfare Office under the Ministry of National Defense
and head of the Combined Logistics Command.</P>
      <P>Kao, a tall well-built man, is associated with many legendary stories, including
one in which he survived a military helicopter crash on Dec. 22, 1974.</P>
      <P>According  to accounts,  the helicopter  carrying  military commanders and Kao,
who was then aide-de-camp to Army Commanding General Yu hao-chang, was on a war
drill when it crashed in Lungtan, northern Taiwan. Kao, despite being severely
injured in the crash, jumped from the aircraft and pulled Yu to safety seconds
before the helicopter burst into flames, it was reported.</P>
      <P>Kao is also known to have ordered the military kitchen to prepare hot chili
dishes for his soldiers to give them a good dining experience in days after the
devastation near ground zero when a 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck central
Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999. Kao led the soldiers in the post-disaster relief
efforts following the deadly quake that killed some 2,000 people.</P>
      <P>In 2006, when Kao was VAC minister, he threatened to quit if the VAC budget for
the following year was cut by NT$5 billion as the Executive Yuan originally
planned, on grounds that the Ministry of National Defense needed more funds for
arms procurement. The VAC budget was eventually cut only by NT$40 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Workplace injury rates close to advanced countries': CLA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's workplace death and injury rates are almost identical to that of
advanced countries in Europe and America thanks to the government's efforts in
reducing workplace injuries in the past eight years, an official at the Council
of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-tang, a section chief of CLA's Department of Labor Safety and Health,
said the government's efforts and measures in reducing occupational injuries has
lowered the occupational death rate and disability rate by 55 percent and 42
percent respectively, during the current government's eight-year tenure.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's occupational death rate of 2007 was 34 per million population, which is
roughly the same as that recorded in the United States for the same year, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in response to a labor group's accusation that the
government has been ineffective in reducing occupational injuries.</P>
      <P>Nearly 60 workers and their families,  led by the Taiwan Association for Victims
of Occupational Injuries, on Monday protested Monday  at the Presidential
Office  against  the government's performance in reducing occupational injuries,
alleging that official statistics of occupational injuries and deaths do not
match actual numbers.</P>
      <P>The association, founded in 1992 by a group of workers with occupational
injuries and their families, has long been active in trying to promote the
public and the government's awareness about improving workplace safety.</P>
      <P>The protest  was held in conjunction  with the April  28 International Workers'
Memorial Day, a day of remembrance for workers who are killed, injured, or made
ill by their work. The day was set by the United Nations in 1996 and since then
has been recognized as a national day by many countries, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The association's secretary-general Huang Hsiao-ling said the toll of workplace
injuries and death released by the government are incorrect. He said many cases
without insurance are not included and many others were not reported by
employers who hoped to hide the facts to protect their company from lawsuits.</P>
      <P>Hang said the actual numbers of occupational death and injuries could be three
to five times that of the number released by the government.</P>
      <P>Responding to Huang's accusation, Lin said the CLA's statistics of occupational
injuries recognize a definition regulated in the Labor Safety and Health Law,
and that many cases without labor insurance were also included in the statistics
compilation as long as they are eligible for compensation under the law.</P>
      <P>Lin added that there indeed are cases missed in statistics, but the CLA's
statistics have been compiled according to international norms, and the
statistics would not be three to five times actual numbers as claimed by Huang.</P>
      <P>Lin insisted that the government has kept making efforts in improving workers'
safety and work environments. He also said the government has designated this
year as the workplace health promotion year to help create a more favorable
working environment for workers.</P>
      <P>In addition to calling for a reflection of the government's performance in
reducing injuries at workplaces, Huang also called on the new government, which
will take up its administration on May 20 when president-elect Ma Ying-jeou is
inaugurated, to halt the rights of enterprises that had major occupational
injury incidents in joining bids for public construction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC chief-designate upbeat about opening of weekend charter flights</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  28  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland  Affairs  Council  (MAC) Chairwoman-designate Lai Shin-yuan said Monday
she is confident that the launch of direct Taiwan-China charter flights on
weekends will begin as planned on July 4.</P>
      <P>Lai's confidence stemmed from her belief that the departing Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) government has already laid much of the groundwork for
the weekend charters and other cross-strait initiatives that the new Kuomintang
(KMT) administration has pledged to implement soon after it takes office May 20.</P>
      <P>The other measures include opening Taiwan wider to Chinese tourists and allowing
Chinese yuan convertibility, but Lai stressed that the Chinese side needs to
show good will and put complementary measures in place to turn these initiatives
into reality.</P>
      <P>"Cross-Taiwan Strait openings should be conducted in an orderly, pragmatic and
step-by-step fashion, based on good faith, " she said.</P>
      <P>Lai said she looks forward to Beijing adopting the same approach to deal with
two-way exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lai's appointment as MAC chief has sparked criticism from within the KMT because
of her background  as a legislator  of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union and close ties to former president and TSU spiritual leader, Lee Teng-hui,
known for his Taiwan-centric ideology.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang, who will take office on May 20,
has long favored a wider opening to China by putting aside disputes concerning
Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>First suspected victim of birth control patch reported in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The controversial Ortho Evra birth control patch, marketed in Taiwan as the Evra
Transdermal Patch, may have claimed its first victim on the island.</P>
      <P>Three Taipei city councilors held a press conference Monday, calling on drug
administration authorities to investigate a case involving a 33-year-old woman
who suffered a stroke and lapsed into a coma after using Evra contraceptive
patches.</P>
      <P>According to councilor Huang Shan-shan, the victim, identified by the surname
Li, was a product designer in Taipei's Neihu Technology Park who had no previous
history of illness. She was rushed to the Armed Forces General Hospital Jan. 21
after suffering a stroke but has never regained consciousness.</P>
      <P>From the contents and receipts in her handbag, Li's family members found that
she was using Evra Transdermal Patches bought from Shanghai Union Dispensary Co.
in Taipei. Her national health insurance record shows that the contraceptive
patches were purchased without a doctor's prescription, in apparent violation of
the law.</P>
      <P>Huang asked Taipei City government officials in charge of drug administration to
take action against the pharmacy.</P>
      <P>Another  councilor,  Pan  Hwai-tzong,  said  sales  of the contraceptive patch
should be banned in Taiwan because cases of blood clots, strokes and other
serious side effects caused by Ortho Evra patches have already been reported in
the United States and Canada.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yu-mei, director of the Food and Drug Division of Taipei City's health
department, said that according to the law, the pharmacy  that sold Li the
contraceptive  patches  without  a prescription should be subjected to a fine of
between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>She also said her division will recommend to the Cabinet-level Department of
Health to re-evaluate the legality of the skin patch.</P>
      <P>The Evra Transdermal contraceptive patch, introduced in Taiwan in 2004, is
manufactured by Ortho McNeil Pharmaceuticals, a division of Johnson and Johnson.</P>
      <P>The product was first introduced in the United States in 2002 under the trade
name Ortho Evra as an alternative to birth control pills. Worn on the body once
a week for less than two months, the patch delivers a steady flow of hormones
through the skin into the bloodstream to inhibit ovulation and prevent
pregnancy.</P>
      <P>By November 2005, there were 23 deaths in the United States linked to the
patches, of which 17 were directly related to blood clots.</P>
      <P>Canadian health authorities have also reported that 17 people have suffered
serious side effects linked to the patch since it was marketed there in early
2004, with two of the 17 dying.</P>
      <P>Experts believe the increased estrogen level on the patch -- 60 percent more
than an oral contraceptive -- is related to the higher risk of developing
serious blood clots.</P>
      <P>In 2006 alone, Johnson and Johnson faced 500 claimants in lawsuits seeking
compensation for deaths and injuries caused by the Ortho Evra patch. Many of the
victims were teenagers and young women of childbearing age who suffered strokes,
heart attacks, pulmonary embolisms and deep vein thrombosis.</P>
      <P>U.S. news media have reported that the manufacturer has adopted a strategy to
settle as many lawsuits as quickly and quietly as possible and at the same time
keep the mega-buck patch on the market for fear of losing billions of dollars in
future sales.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The designated head of the Government Information Office (GIO) , Vanessa Yea-
ping Shih, pledged Monday to communicate  effectively with both the domestic
media and the international community.</P>
      <P>A career diplomat, Shih is now vice chairwoman of the NGO Affairs Committee
under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) . She has rarely appeared in the
limelight, but she caught the media's attention Monday when she was named as
Executive Yuan spokeswoman on a partial list of Cabinet appointees presented by
Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Shih, a former deputy representative to Australia, told reporters that the GIO
plays the role of maintaining communications between government and the media,
and between government and the people of the country.</P>
      <P>Therefore, after assuming office, Shih said she will make every effort to
faithfully report the government's policies and achievements through the media,
while gathering views from the public that the government can refer to in
outlining or carrying out its policies, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Born in 1962, Shih is a mother of two children. She holds a master's degree in
diplomacy of National Chengchi University and has served at the MOFA's
Department of Information and Cultural Affairs and Department of North American
Affairs, and also as a secretary to the representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>Shih was also the secretary to Ting Mou-shih when the latter served as National
Security Council secretary-general in 1994-1999. She was then transferred back
to the MOFA to serve as deputy chief of the personnel department.</P>
      <P>Before being promoted to the post of deputy representative to Australia, Shih
had also served as deputy director general of MOFA's Department of Protocol. In
late March this year, Shih was appointed to serve as vice chairman of MOFA's NGO
Affairs Committee but has yet to be sworn in.</P>
      <P>Asked to guess why she was invited to join the Cabinet, Shih said that while
serving in Australia, she organized President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's itinerary in
Australia in 2006 when Ma was Taipei mayor. Maybe it was her performance at that
time that convinced Ma of her ability to do the job, Shih said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF and MAC will communicate well: SEF chairman-designate</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman-designate of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
, said Monday he believes that SEF and the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will
communicate smoothly and cooperate well in the future.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who is also a vice chairman of Kuomintang (KMT), made the remarks upon
returning to Taiwan from a five-day visit to China Monday afternoon, after Lai
Shin-yuan was named chairwoman-designate of the MAC, Taiwan's top China policy
planner and coordinator.</P>
      <P>The appointment  of Lai,  formerly a legislator  with the pro-independence
Taiwan Solidarity Union known for her protests against substandard Chinese
goods, raised speculation that the MAC would clash with the SEF, a semi-official
body set up by Taiwan to handle cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>Chiang's remarks were seen as an apparent attempt to dispel speculation that the
two bodies would be at odds with each other in executing the more open China
policy espoused by President-elect Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>He may have also wanted to ease the doubts of Taiwanese businesses with
operations in China worried about Lai's previous anti-China sentiment, and he
hailed her as a hard-working legislator who could easily bring her talent into
full play in the MAC.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait relations heavily influence Taiwan's economic
development, Chiang said Ma presented many policies to expand cross-strait ties
during his electoral campaign.</P>
      <P>"The president-elect not only presented concrete plans, he had a timetable for
them, " Chiang said, meaning it was important that both the MAC and SEF fully
cooperate to get things done quickly and well after Ma takes office May 20.</P>
      <P>But a blip in putting those policies into action may have emerged when Chiang
confirmed that he will not be visiting Beijing on May 25 as expected on another
trip to thank Ma supporters who returned to Taiwan to vote for him on March 22.</P>
      <P>Local media speculated that he was also to meet Chen Yunlin, the head of China's
Taiwan Affairs Office who is widely tipped to head the SEF's Chinese counterpart
-- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- on that
trip, and attributed the trip's cancellation in part to Lai's appointment.</P>
      <P>But Chiang explained that he wanted to complete the SEF's reshuffling of
personnel under the new administration before deciding when to relaunch talks
with China.</P>

      <P>National Police Agency Director-General Hou Yu-yih presented awards Monday to
honor 35 police officers for losing significant amounts of weight.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the awards ceremony, Hou said that he was very impressed with the
result of local police officers' efforts to lose weight under a project launched
by the agency Jan. 21 to promote physical fitness among local police.</P>
      <P>Under the project, a total of 33,329 police officers lost a combined 45,279
kilograms, or 1.36 kg per person, through exercising, diet control and health
counseling in the past three months, Hou pointed out.</P>
      <P>The agency launched a series of campaigns recently to improve the health of
local policemen after 36 police officers were suspected of dying on the job from
stress and obesity.</P>
      <P>Lien Chin-hsiu, a policewoman in the eastern city of Hualien, said at the awards
ceremony that she lost 30 kilograms from swimming and biking.</P>

      <P>Sports  Affairs  Council  (SAC) Chairwoman-designate Tai Hsia-ling said Monday
that the performance of Taiwan's athletes in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games will
be her top priority when she takes her post, with promoting exercise among local
residents following closely behind.</P>
      <P>Tai said she will do her best to provide Taiwanese athletes who have qualified
to compete in the Games the resources necessary for them to perform at the
highest level.</P>
      <P>Tai was among the group of new Cabinet officials announced by Premier-designate
Liu Chao-shiuan Monday. She will replace incumbent SAC Chairman Yang Chung-ho
after President-elect Ma Ying-jeou is inaugurated May 20.</P>
      <P>The new chairwoman, the second woman to head Taiwan's top sports agency, once
competed on the national track team in the 400-meter hurdles and the 4 x 100
relay, and was at one point a national record holder in the 4 x 100 relay.</P>
      <P>Tai also has a strong educational background. She received a PhD in management
from Spalding University in Kentucky and has worked as dean of the Student
Affairs Office at Taipei Municipal University of Education.</P>
      <P>Tai said getting Taiwan's people to exercise will be her second priority, as she
hopes to improve public health.</P>
      <P>She will also increase funding for the promotion of mainstream sports like track
and field, swimming, and gymnastics, explaining that emerging sports like
archery and judo have taken funding away from the more common sports, which has
led to their stagnation.</P>
      <P>Asked about the direction of a new sports lottery that will be launched May 2,
Tai said more evaluation is needed to select the sports that will be bet on, but
she suggested that Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League needed to be
included to promote the country's only professional sports league.</P>

      <P>Three Kaohsiung City councilors criticized the high juvenile crime rate in the
southern port city Monday and urged police authorities to do something about it.</P>
      <P>Chen Li-chen, a city councilor of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), warned during
an interpellation session that if Kaohsiung's crime rate is not reduced,
Taiwan's second largest city will face an image problem when it hosts the 2009
World Games from July 16-26.</P>
      <P>The event, held every four years, is expected to draw 4,600 athletes from some
100 countries.</P>
      <P>Another KMT councilor, Tung Yen-chen, cited statistics as showing that Kaohsiung
ranked first among Taiwan's cities and counties in terms of juvenile delinquency
rates, with 2,303 cases reported in 2006, followed by 2,174 cases in Taichung
and 1,976 cases in Taipei.</P>
      <P>She urged the city's juvenile police squad to reduce the school dropout rate
through interviews with parents and teachers, because the dropouts are likely to
become repeat offenders in society when they grow up.</P>
      <P>Councilor Huang Shao-ting, also a member of the KMT, said bluntly that
Kaohsiung's police chiefs should devote more time and effort to boosting the
morale of their police forces and spend less time on handling public relations.
He also asked the police not to cut down the number of criminal cases through
statistical gimmicks.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chun-chang, head of the Kaohsiung Police Bureau, promised that he will not
tolerate any manipulation of the numbers in recording reported criminal cases,
and that he will also have police officers patrol crime hot spots more
frequently.</P>

      <P>A 21-ton batch of coconuts imported from Thailand have been found to contain a
banned pesticide, the Department of Health (DOH) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ting-hung, vice director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Safety, said that
tests on samples from the shipment of 30,000 Rungtawan coconuts detected 0.18
ppm of the fungicide Carbendazim in their juice and meat.</P>
      <P>Although the volume of Carbendazim was minimal, any produce containing traces of
the substance should be destroyed, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>When the government authorities asked to inspect the coconuts, the importer
signed a document agreeing to store them in a special warehouse and selling them
only after the test was completed.</P>
      <P>But when Taipei County health officials went to the warehouse after the tests
were completed on April 18 to destroy the coconuts, they discovered the coconuts
were gone.</P>
      <P>Local health officials said they didn't know if the coconuts "have been
deliberately hidden somewhere or they have been sold to the public."</P>
      <P>According to the related regulations on food safety management, the importer is
subject to a fine of NT$200,000 (around US$6,580).</P>
      <P>But in the case, the importer from Tucheng, Taipei County, seemed to "prefer
paying the fine than facing the fate of losing the batch of coconuts."</P>
      <P>Carbendazim is used to control a broad range of diseases in arable crops,
fruits, and vegetables. The use of the chemical is believed to affect hormone
function.</P>

      <P>The Taipei county government kicked off an exhibition highlighting occupational
hazards Monday to remember local laborers who lost their lives on the job, a
county statement said that day.</P>
      <P>The exhibition began as 168 countries around the world marked International
Workers' Memorial Day on April 28 to recognize workers who are killed, injured,
or made ill by their work, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The day was set by the United Nations in 1996 and since then has been observed
by many countries, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The exhibition -- which the county government in northern Taiwan borrowed from
the National Museum of Natural Science in the central city of Taichung -- is
open to the public free of charge at the county government building from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. every day, and will run through May 7.</P>
      <P>The exhibition features images, paintings and interactive devices designed to
raise the public's awareness of various potential workplace dangers to human
health, the statement noted.</P>
      <P>The exhibition also focuses on possible hazards at home and on campus, the
statement went on.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei said in the statement that he discovered
after conducting safety inspection checks on local factories and construction
sites that many companies did not protect their workers well enough.</P>
      <P>A total of 45 workers died last year in Taipei County, and another nine were
killed at work as of April 20 this year, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Chou also said that the county's Labor Affairs Bureau has begun planning a labor
checkup department, which will be established in two years after getting the
necessary funding and personnel.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Index suggests Taiwan's economy set to slow down</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
04/29/08  00:12:33
(By Yeh Fang-hsun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy flashed another green light in March, signaling steady growth
for the fifth consecutive month, but the continuing decline of a leading index
of business cycle indicators shows the economy faces an uncertain future, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan uses a number of indicator indexes to track the economy. The monitoring
indicators reflect the general economic outlook at present, with green a sign of
steady growth.</P>
      <P>The composite leading index indicates how the economic should perform in the
coming months by using economic indicators that change well ahead of movements
in the overall economy.</P>
      <P>Average monthly overtime hours, building permits issued, changes in inventory,
and stock price indexes, are all examples of such indicators.</P>
      <P>The leading index's six-month rate of change -- which predicts turning points in
economic activity some six months ahead -- fell 0.4 percentage points to 0.2
percent, and has fallen 5 percentage points since September 2007.</P>
      <P>Hung Jui-bin, the head of the CEPD's Department of Economic Research, attributed
the persistent decline to global inflationary pressures and financial turbulence
following the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis that has added downside risks to
domestic economic prospects.</P>
      <P>But he downplayed the possibility of an economic contraction in the near future,
saying the council needs more time to determine if the economic cycle is on a
downward spiral.</P>
      <P>"Despite the composite leading index's 5 percent downfall since September and
its month-on-month decline of 0.1 percent in March to 149.1, it is still too
early to say if the economy is heading toward a contraction," Hung said.</P>
      <P>Hung said the fall in the index's six-month rate of change still had yet to
match the rate's downward spiral in an eight-month span from 2000 to 2001, when
the leading indicators plummeted 13.5 percent as a result of the Internet
bubble.</P>
      <P>Hung believed there were still some reasons for optimism.</P>
      <P>"The country's productivity and exports are still in good shape," he said, and
coincident indicators were also on the upswing.</P>
      <P>Coincident indicators, which generally reflect the state of the economy as it
exists today, went up for the third consecutive month in March, rising 0.1
percent to 157.2, Hung said.</P>
      <P>Manufacturing sales and customs-cleared exports in March also had positive
cyclical movements from the previous month.</P>
      <P>"But the sales index of wholesale, retail and food services dropped 1.2 points
to 123.3 month-on-month, " Hung added, saying the local consumer market is still
underperforming.</P>
      <P>Coincident indicators include nonagricultural employment and personal income,
which generally move in stride with the overall economy.</P>
      <P>Other positive economic signs cited by Hung included the recent recovery in the
local bourse, which rose 1.9 percent in March, and Taiwan's economic growth
forecast, which was recently adjusted upward by the World Bank to 4.3 percent
from 3.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Scholars  also downplayed  the negative  composite  leading indicators index,
saying the local market might be merely adjusting from an overheated market last
September, when a yellow-red light was recorded.</P>
      <P>"The decline in leading indicators is the result of a seasonal downturn in
business. Sales are usually slower now than in the latter half of the year,
which usually regains vitality as manufacturers begin to deliver orders," said
Chen Miao, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.</P>
      <P>Citing the 17.6 percent rise in export value in the first quarter of 2008, Chen
said Taiwan's manufacturers are still going strong in the face of decelerating
global trade.</P>
      <P>He attributed March declines in the wholesale and retail sectors to relatively
high consumer spending in February, as local shoppers may have bought much of
what they planned to buy during the month during which Chinese New Year was
celebrated this year.</P>
      <P>The negative growth of real wages in Taiwan, where inflation is outpacing rises

      <P>Taiwan's real wage growth from January to February recorded its worst
performance since 1981, with negative growth of 1.52 percent, as inflation more

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese captain admits killing two Indonesian crewmen</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The captain of a Taiwanese ship which earlier reported a mutiny aboard the
vessel has admitted that he killed two Indonesian crewmembers, the Coast Guard
Administration (CGA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Captain Tsai Chih-chang confessed to the killings during the investigation into
the bloodshed aboard the fishing ship, Wan Yi Chun, which is registered in
Siaoliouchiou in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>CGA officials said that after the CGA cutter escorted the ship back to Kaohsiung
Monday afternoon,  they conducted  separate interrogations of the captain and
three surviving Indonesian members.</P>
      <P>They said the incident could have been triggered by an Indonesian fisherman
named Roid, who inadvertently let a tuna he caught slip back to the sea.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that because his catch had been poor, he was in a bad mood, and when
he saw Roid lose his hold on the fish, he pushed the Indonesian crewman into the
sea, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The other two Indonesian crewmembers -- Rusdin and Driyantoro -- then apparently
tried to avenge their colleague, and he killed them with a fishing knife.</P>
      <P>Another Indonesian crewmember, Abidin Jenal, was stabbed in the hand and hip
because Tsai suspected he was on the side of the trio.</P>
      <P>The other three Indonesian crewmembers -- Mufitadi, Semsayor and Kamarudin --
told CGA officials during questioning that they saw Tsai push Roid into the sea.</P>
      <P>The officials have turned Tsai over to the Pingtung Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>The officials said Captain Tsai and four Indonesian crewmen were aboard the ship
when it set sail from Donggang, Pingtung County, March 6, for waters in
southeast of Lanyu (Orchid Island) to catch tuna and oriental sailfish.</P>
      <P>The other three Indonesian fishermen joined the ship later at sea.</P>
      <P>The CGA sent a cutter to the ship operating in waters off Hengchun, in southern
Taiwan, after Captain Tsai solicited assistance via satellite  phone Sunday
morning,  saying  that Indonesian crewmembers on board threatened to kill him.</P>
      <P>A CGA cutter, patrolling waters off Eluanbi,  at Taiwan's southernmost tip,
rushed to the scene of the ship Sunday afternoon. Only when the officials
boarded the ship did they discover that two Indonesian fishermen had died, one
had gone missing and another was injured in the incident.</P>
      <P>A helicopter picked up Abidin Jenal for medical treatment at a Pingtung hospital
later Sunday. His condition was stable.</P>
      <P>The cutter escorted the ship back to Kaohsiung harbor Monday afternoon and
conducted the investigation.</P>
      <P>The CGA had originally suspected that wage disparities between the original
crewmembers and the new arrivals and management problems had given rise to the
discontent and caused the mutiny.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Sports  Affairs  Council  (SAC) Chairwoman-designate Tai Hsia-ling said Monday
that the performance of Taiwan's athletes in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games will
be her top priority when she takes her post, with promoting exercise among local
residents following closely behind.</P>
      <P>Tai said she will do her best to provide Taiwanese athletes who have qualified
to compete in the Games the resources necessary for them to perform at the
highest level.</P>
      <P>Tai was among the group of new Cabinet officials announced by Premier-designate
Liu Chao-shiuan Monday. She will replace incumbent SAC Chairman Yang Chung-ho
after President-elect Ma Ying-jeou is inaugurated May 20.</P>
      <P>The new chairwoman, the second woman to head Taiwan's top sports agency, once
competed on the national track team in the 400-meter hurdles and the 4 x 100
relay, and was at one point a national record holder in the 4 x 100 relay.</P>
      <P>Tai also has a strong educational background. She received a PhD in management
from Spalding University in Kentucky and has worked as dean of the Student
Affairs Office at Taipei Municipal University of Education.</P>
      <P>Tai said getting Taiwan's people to exercise will be her second priority, as she
hopes to improve public health.</P>
      <P>She will also increase funding for the promotion of mainstream sports like track
and field, swimming, and gymnastics, explaining that emerging sports like
archery and judo have taken funding away from the more common sports, which has
led to their stagnation.</P>
      <P>Asked about the direction of a new sports lottery that will be launched May 2,
Tai said more evaluation is needed to select the sports that will be bet on, but
she suggested that Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League needed to be
included to promote the country's only professional sports league.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three Kaohsiung City councilors criticized the high juvenile crime rate in the
southern port city Monday and urged police authorities to do something about it.</P>
      <P>Chen Li-chen, a city councilor of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), warned during
an interpellation session that if Kaohsiung's crime rate is not reduced,
Taiwan's second largest city will face an image problem when it hosts the 2009
World Games from July 16-26.</P>
      <P>The event, held every four years, is expected to draw 4,600 athletes from some
100 countries.</P>
      <P>Another KMT councilor, Tung Yen-chen, cited statistics as showing that Kaohsiung
ranked first among Taiwan's cities and counties in terms of juvenile delinquency
rates, with 2,303 cases reported in 2006, followed by 2,174 cases in Taichung
and 1,976 cases in Taipei.</P>
      <P>She urged the city's juvenile police squad to reduce the school dropout rate
through interviews with parents and teachers, because the dropouts are likely to
become repeat offenders in society when they grow up.</P>
      <P>Councilor Huang Shao-ting, also a member of the KMT, said bluntly that
Kaohsiung's police chiefs should devote more time and effort to boosting the
morale of their police forces and spend less time on handling public relations.
He also asked the police not to cut down the number of criminal cases through
statistical gimmicks.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chun-chang, head of the Kaohsiung Police Bureau, promised that he will not
tolerate any manipulation of the numbers in recording reported criminal cases,
and that he will also have police officers patrol crime hot spots more
frequently.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 21-ton batch of coconuts imported from Thailand have been found to contain a
banned pesticide, the Department of Health (DOH) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ting-hung, vice director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Safety, said that
tests on samples from the shipment of 30,000 Rungtawan coconuts detected 0.18
ppm of the fungicide Carbendazim in their juice and meat.</P>
      <P>Although the volume of Carbendazim was minimal, any produce containing traces of
the substance should be destroyed, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>When the government authorities asked to inspect the coconuts, the importer
signed a document agreeing to store them in a special warehouse and selling them
only after the test was completed.</P>
      <P>But when Taipei County health officials went to the warehouse after the tests
were completed on April 18 to destroy the coconuts, they discovered the coconuts
were gone.</P>
      <P>Local health officials said they didn't know if the coconuts "have been
deliberately hidden somewhere or they have been sold to the public."</P>
      <P>According to the related regulations on food safety management, the importer is
subject to a fine of NT$200,000 (around US$6,580).</P>
      <P>But in the case, the importer from Tucheng, Taipei County, seemed to "prefer
paying the fine than facing the fate of losing the batch of coconuts."</P>
      <P>Carbendazim is used to control a broad range of diseases in arable crops,
fruits, and vegetables. The use of the chemical is believed to affect hormone
function.</P>

      <P>The Taipei county government kicked off an exhibition highlighting occupational
hazards Monday to remember local laborers who lost their lives on the job, a
county statement said that day.</P>
      <P>The exhibition began as 168 countries around the world marked International
Workers' Memorial Day on April 28 to recognize workers who are killed, injured,
or made ill by their work, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The day was set by the United Nations in 1996 and since then has been observed
by many countries, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The exhibition -- which the county government in northern Taiwan borrowed from
the National Museum of Natural Science in the central city of Taichung -- is
open to the public free of charge at the county government building from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. every day, and will run through May 7.</P>
      <P>The exhibition features images, paintings and interactive devices designed to
raise the public's awareness of various potential workplace dangers to human
health, the statement noted.</P>
      <P>The exhibition also focuses on possible hazards at home and on campus, the
statement went on.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei said in the statement that he discovered
after conducting safety inspection checks on local factories and construction
sites that many companies did not protect their workers well enough.</P>
      <P>A total of 45 workers died last year in Taipei County, and another nine were
killed at work as of April 20 this year, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Chou also said that the county's Labor Affairs Bureau has begun planning a labor

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday it will continue to push for
the release of a Tibetan activist of Republic of China nationality arrested in
Japan for attempting to disrupt the Olympic torch relay.</P>
      <P>The agency hopes that staff members of Taipei's representative office in Japan
will be able to meet the detainee, who has been held incommunicado for over 48
hours, by tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Tashi Tsering, vice chairman of the Taiwan chapter of the Tibetan Youth
Congress, was arrested Saturday after he attempted to seize the Olympic torch
from Ai Fukuhara, a Japanese table tennis player, during the flame's relay in
Nagano in central Japan.</P>
      <P>The activist is from a Tibetan family that took refuge in India after China took
control of Tibet in the 1950s. He came to Taiwan in the 1990s and has obtained
Republic of China citizenship.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the Japanese government will give proper care to Tashi Tsering and
respect his human rights, " Peter Tsai, deputy executive director of MOFA's
Committee on Japanese Affairs, said at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>"Today is a public holiday in Japan, so we hope that our staff members in Japan
will be able to see Tashi Tsering by tomorrow, " he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative  office in Japan was informed that Japanese police have
applied to extend Tashi Tsering's detention at a police station in Nagano for 10
more days, said Tsai, who stressed that the ministry will keep close tabs on the
situation and offer legal assistance.</P>
      <P>Nagano was the 16th stop of the 2008 Beijing Olympic torch relay. Japanese
police dispatched over 3,000 officers to safeguard the torch, but several minor
clashes still broke out between Tibetan activists and Chinese expatriates in

    <HEADLINE>Local manufacturers upbeat over future</HEADLINE>

      <P>Buoyed by a 17.6 percent jump in export value in the first quarter and
recovering corporate profitability, Taiwan's manufacturers are regaining
confidence in the future, an economic research unit said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In the Taiwan Institute for Economic Research's monthly business climate survey,
the climate index for the manufacturing sector soared by 18.46 points to 120.42
in March, its largest jump since 1978.</P>
      <P>The rise indicates that the country's continuing strong export performance  has
helped local producers  regain confidence  as international markets recover from
the financial distress caused by the U.S. banking crisis.</P>
      <P>"Despite suffering from the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, global consumption
showed signs of recovery in the first quarter, " said Dr. David Hong, the head
of TIER.</P>
      <P>Citing the expanding Asian economy, including China, Hong said local exports
could remain strong.</P>
      <P>"Facing the seasonal weakness in the first quarter, Taiwan's export value in
March still grew 22.8 percent month-on-month, " he said.</P>
      <P>The survey included a poll in which 39.7 percent of respondents from the
manufacturing sector held a positive outlook for the next six months, up from
35.0 percent in February.</P>
      <P>But Hong downplayed the influence of the potential for closer cross-strait
economic ties, one of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's campaign pledges, on the
more confident outlook.</P>
      <P>"This poll did not include future policy factors, " Hong said, adding that once
the new policies are implemented, the TIER will re-evaluate the potential
changes to make new projections.</P>
      <P>The March survey also showed a 3.42 rise in the business climate index for the
service sector, reaching 119.02 from 115.6 in February.</P>
      <P>"With the impact of the U.S. financial crisis on the wane, and the potential
relaxation on cross-strait exchanges such as direct charter  flights  and
bilateral  banking investment,  financial institutions are upbeat about the
future, " explained Chen Miao, an associate research fellow of the TIER.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's economic growth forecast, Chen said the private think tank
projected 2008 gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 4.3 percent, considerably
lower than the 5.7 percent growth registered in 2007.</P>
      <P>"We are still seeing the continued impact of skyrocketing international
commodity prices, which has also pushed TIER's annual projection for inflation
to 2.32 percent, up from last year's 1.8 percent," he added.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) urged the Japanese government Tuesday not
to compromise Taiwan's rights and interests in a major communique it is likely
to sign with China during President Hu Jintao's visit to Japan next week.</P>
      <P>Peter Tsai, deputy executive director of the MOFA's Committee on Japanese
Affairs, said at a regular press briefing that during his visit to Japan May 6
to May 10, Hu will meet Japanese Emperor Akihito and Prime Minister Yasuo
Fukuda.</P>
      <P>Tsai said it is very likely that they will sign the fourth China-Japan
communique  on  issues  such  as  anti-terrorism, environmental  protection,
economic  assistance  and  security cooperation based on mutual interests and
reciprocity.</P>
      <P>"However, such a communique is only a political commitment and has no legal
effect," he noted.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the Foreign Ministry will pay close attention to Hu's visit and hope
that Taiwan's rights will not be compromised by any bilateral agreement between
China and Japan.</P>
      <P>Japan and China have previously signed three major communiques, the Sino-
Japanese Statement in 1972, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and
Japan in 1978, and the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration in 1998.</P>
      <P>As to President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration ceremony May 20,  Tsai
disclosed that a cross-party  group of 26 Japanese parliamentarians is scheduled
to attend the ceremony.</P>
      <P>This has not yet been confirmed, however, as the Japanese parliament might
restrain its members from going abroad due to the tension among parties in the
parliament, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan's representative to Japan will be replaced after the new
government takes office next month, MOFA's spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said there
were no plans to do so.</P>
      <P>"Based on the continuity of diplomacy, there is no such law or regulation that
overseas representatives and ambassadors appointed by the outgoing government
have to follow the old cabinet and resign by May 21," she noted.</P>
      <P>She added that the new administration will have its own concerns and make
arrangements after it takes office.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou pledged Tuesday to be a "culture president" and
said culture will help Taiwan promote itself in the international community,
during a meeting with Lin Hwai-min, the founder and artistic director of the
world-renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theatre.</P>
      <P>"A city can be expanded and become bigger through public construction, but only
the development of culture will make the city great, " Ma said after visiting
Lin for about an hour.</P>
      <P>The president-elect suggested that in addition to exporting computers or
electronic devices abroad, culture is also an important product that Taiwan can
use to enhance its image and reputation abroad.</P>
      <P>"How to develop a cultural product into not only a creative work but also one
that touches people is crucial, " Ma said, promising that "Taiwan will be a
culture-based nation, and I will become a culture president."</P>
      <P>He also noted that many Taiwanese artistic groups have looked for further
development in China, but urged the culture industry to deepen its "roots in
Taiwan" while developing overseas.</P>
      <P>"This is also a task that our government must make efforts to tackle," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma vowed to raise the annual budget for cultural affairs from the
current 1.3 percent to 4 percent of gross domestic product during his term to
spur cultural development.</P>
      <P>Expressing appreciation of Ma's determination to take action on culture-related
issues, Lin hoped that "the minister-designate in charge of the Council for
Cultural Affairs Huang Pi-tuan can gradually realize Ma's policies."</P>
      <P>Lin further suggested that Ma's administration should first review the
regulations governing art in Taiwan and then establish a clear blueprint for the
country's cultural development in Taiwan before putting the revised guidelines
into practice.</P>
      <P>"We have to be concerned about how to create a better cultural environment
within which all the artists are able to survive and grow," Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIER forecasts GDP growth of 4.3% for 2008</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
04/29/08  15:10:55

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is expected to grow by 4.3 percent for 2008, down from last
year's growth of 5.7 percent, the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research said
Monday in its latest forecast.</P>
      <P>Although growth will be lower than in 2007, the TIER said that growth of over 4
percent is "normal and stable" for a country whose economy and industrial
development have matured.</P>
      <P>The TIER said that Taiwan's export driven economy cannot avoid the impact of the
slowdown in global economic growth.</P>
      <P>However, the continued stable expansion of emerging economies in 2008 is
expected to help Taiwan maintain steady export growth, according to the private
economic think tank.</P>
      <P>The institute forecast import and export growth of 13.61 percent and 11.16
percent, respectively. With growth in imports outpacing exports, Taiwan's trade
surplus is expected to reach US$25.105 billion in 2008, or roughly the same as
the figure for 2007, the TIER said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's trade surplus for 2007 was US$27.4 billion, according to Ministry of
Finance statistics.</P>
      <P>The TIER said that with the government's infrastructure projects and state-run
enterprise reform plans, the growth rate for fixed public investment in 2008
will rebound into positive territory and reach 3.65 percent.</P>
      <P>Although domestic industries continue to relocate overseas in large numbers, the
TIER said, private investment growth in Taiwan is expected to reach 3.99 percent
for the year as local businesses continue to invest in building new factories
and industrial upgrading in an environment of stable economic expansion.</P>
      <P>The TIER further said that although it expects oil prices to return to US$80 a
barrel, rising agricultural and industrial raw material prices and rising
inflationary pressures will result in wholesale prices increasing by 6.63
percent for 2008.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei County law enforcement and consumer rights authorities on Tuesday tracked
down a businessman  who illegally disposed of a 21-ton shipment of coconuts
imported from Thailand that were found to contain the residue of a banned
pesticide.</P>
      <P>The businessman,  Mo Yu-huei,  was taken  to the Criminal Investigation Bureau
early Tuesday to be interrogated.</P>
      <P>According to a cable TV news station, the trading company owner refused to
disclose who bought the tainted coconuts but said his company had sold the goods
to some street vendors.</P>
      <P>Chain hypermarket outlets in the county, including RT-Mart, Carrefour and
Welcome, also underwent inspections Tuesday, but none were selling the tainted
coconuts.</P>
      <P>They were asked, however, to take any coconuts from Thailand they were selling
off their shelves until additional tests could be conducted.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day,  county officials responsible for the protection of
consumers' rights and health raided Mo's company -- named "Jih Chao" in Mandarin
-- at its registered address in Tucheng, but only found a household there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, police tracked the trader's actual operational base to Lujhou in the
northern part of the county in the hope of finding the coconuts.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) reported the previous day that tests on samples
from the shipment of over 30,000 Rungtawan coconuts detected 0.18 ppm of the
fungicide Carbendazim in their juice and meat.</P>
      <P>Although the volume of Carbendazim was minimal, any produce containing traces of
the substance should be destroyed, said Hsieh Ting-hung, vice director of the
DOH's Bureau of Food Safety.</P>
      <P>When the government authorities asked to inspect the coconuts on April 18, the
importer signed a letter of indemnity agreeing to store them in a special
warehouse and selling them only after the test was completed.</P>
      <P>But when Taipei County health officials went to the warehouse after the tests
were completed to destroy the coconuts, they discovered the coconuts were gone.</P>
      <P>Carbendazim is used to control a broad range of diseases in crops, fruits, and
vegetables. The use of the chemical is believed to affect hormone function.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several environmental groups urged President-elect Ma Ying-jeou Tuesday to
clearly articulate his policy on the environment, after a provisional resolution
was passed in a legislative  committee last week to suspend a government land
restoration plan.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) legislators Kung Wen-chi, Lin Tsang-ming and Chiu Ching-chun
argued during a committee meeting in the Legislative Yuan that the National Land
Restoration Strategy and Action Plan should not be approved before the National
Land Restoration Act was enacted.</P>
      <P>They argued that the restoration plan did not provide a detailed assessment of
people's rights and environmental protection and could have a serious impact on
the country's development.</P>
      <P>The National Land Restoration Act, approved by the Executive Yuan in 2005, aims
to restore eroded land in coastal and mountainous regions, and would promote
land conservation, limit the construction of new roads in mountainous areas and
help indigenous people rebuild their homes.</P>
      <P>The act was shelved in the Legislative Yuan, however, and has been seldom
discussed since, drawing criticism from environmental groups.</P>
      <P>Realizing that the proposed law had little chance of making its way through the
legislature, the Executive Yuan in the same year introduced the National Land
Restoration Strategy and Action Plan -- which did not require legislative
approval -- to proceed with land restoration projects.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government implemented the plan, but the
KMT legislators pushed through a resolution in committee to suspend the plan.</P>
      <P>"Now that the plan may be suspended, Ma should make clear his position and
policy on national lands, " said DPP legislator Lin Shu-fen, who noted that Ma
touted national land restoration during his presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>"Ma's plan to restore national lands is a kind of atonement for the KMT's
enormous exploitation and development when it was in power." said Lee Ken-cheng,
secretary-general of Mercy on the Earth, Taiwan, an environmental association.</P>
      <P>He said that if Ma's policy views clashed with the stance of KMT lawmakers, then
Ma should make public his opinion known on the opposition to the plan by his
party's legislators.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen's participation in the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) chairmanship election has been a "good" thing, a noted Taiwan
political observer said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Antonio Chiang, who arrived in Washington D.C. last week to attend a seminar
sponsored by a U.S. think tank, made the remarks when he was interviewed by the
Voice of America Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who has long been involved in opposition media and served as the deputy
secretary-general of the National Security Council (NSC), was asked about how
the floundering party can regain its feet after its latest setback in the March
22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Speaking  on the three hopefuls in the May 18 DPP party chairmanship election,
he noted that the participation of two pro-independence diehards -- Koo Kuan-
min, former senior adviser to President Chen Shui-bian and Legislator Trong Chai
-- prompted the party's young turks to unite and persuade former Vice Premier
Tsai Ing-wen to join the race, which he termed as a "good phenomenon."</P>
      <P>Saying that the DPP has regressed to a "conservative" force, he said that it
desperately "needs new faces and a new mind-set."</P>
      <P>He suggested all those who were active in the 1978 "Kaohsiung Incident, "
including Vice President Annette Lu, former DPP Chairmen Shih Ming-teh and Lin
Yi-hsiung, and Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, as well as the lawyers who defended
them --- President Chen Shui-bian and incumbent DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh -- will
step back to allow the younger generation to take the helm of the party.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung  Incident refers to a peaceful commemorative activity marking
Human Rights Day on Dec. 10, 1978 that turned violent. Many human rights
activists directly or indirectly involved in the incident  later formed the DPP
and rose to political prominence.</P>
      <P>Chiang pointed out that out of election considerations, the DPP has in recent
years dwelled too much on playing up the ethnic divide and national identity
issues, which has turned it into a "conservative" force.</P>
      <P>He observed that even though the KMT has not undergone dramatic changes or
reforms over the past few years, the DPP had let too many people down.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP is still young, signs of an "elder politics mentality" have
emerged, which has led it to fall out of step with the changing times, he added.</P>
      <P>Chiang also lauded the incoming KMT administration's choice of a former
legislator from the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union to serve as the
nation's top China policy planner, describing it as a "creative" arrangement.</P>
      <P>He was referring to Lai Shin-yuan's designation as the chairwoman of the
Mainland  Affairs Council (MAC) ,  and he lauded her professionalism,
international perspective and expertise in trade and economic issues.</P>
      <P>But he also said how much room she'll have to maneuver in her post will hinge on
how much authority President-elect Ma Ying-jeou gives her.</P>
      <P>"This is because cross-Taiwan Strait relations fall under the realm of the
president, and it will depend on how Ma is going to handle it," Chiang added.</P>
      <P>Based on his experience in the NSC between 2000 and 2004, he observed that there
is much to do and discuss in the area of cross-strait trade.</P>
      <P>But the major challenge, he said, will come on the diplomatic front, which will
decide whether there is a truce in the diplomatic tug-of-war and Taiwan has room
to maneuver in the international community.</P>
      <P>"The interests of the two sides often clash on this front," he noted.</P>
      <P>He stressed  that judging from China's  current  political structure, the
policies of China's diplomatic and military systems are starkly different from
those of the Taiwan Affairs Office under its State Council.</P>
      <P>Even if the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can resume stalled dialogues in a
good atmosphere, the diplomatic and military forces in China will not
necessarily toe the same line, he observed.</P>

      <P>The ICDF was established as a foundation by the Republic of China government in
1996 in order to carry out international development projects.</P>
      <P>The organization's  purpose is to strengthen  international cooperation and
enhance foreign relations by promoting economic development, social progress and
the welfare of the people in partner nations around the world.</P>
      <P>Huang said volunteering is very meaningful as students not only can experience
different cultures but can also become aware of the predicament of
underdeveloped countries -- an experience that they will not be able to get in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted  that in the United  States,  many distinguished youngsters, daughters
and sons of celebrities, politicians and students of top universities volunteer
in organizations such as the Peace Corps as their first job after graduation.</P>
      <P>Citing an example, he said the daughter of former American Institute in Taiwan
Director Douglas Paal chose to volunteer in Africa for a year instead of coming
to spend Christmas with her father in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Volunteering can develop young people's humanitarian concerns and international
views, " Huang said. "The signature of a letter of intent between the ICDF and
NTU provides a great opportunity for our students to test themselves and pursue
their dreams."</P>
      <P>NTU President Lee noted that all NTU students are required to take a three- year
course called "serve and learn, " with students volunteering to provide social
services in remote areas during winter and summer vacations.</P>
      <P>"With the signing of cooperation with the ICDF, NTU students will have the
chance to get involved in the societies of Taiwan's diplomatic allies and really
grasp international trends," he said.</P>
      <P>Since 1996, the ICDF has dispatched 312 volunteers to 30 countries around the
world.</P>
      <P>Services provided by Taiwan overseas volunteers include basic consulting
services for small and medium enterprises, vocational and computer training, and
instruction in Chinese language and other subjects.</P>
      <P>This year, the ICDF extended its volunteer programs to recruit 115 long-term and
short-term volunteers to serve as a new generation of Taiwan's "grass-roots
diplomats, " said Chow Yen-shin, assistant secretary general of the ICDF.</P>
      <P>He added that the organization hopes to work with industry unions in the near
future to recruit talent from different fields and create a new force for
Taiwan's diplomatic work.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung County favors halting fallow policy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   April  29  (CNA)
04/29/08  17:48:14
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In anticipation of the central government's plan to halt its current fallow
policy amid a looming food shortage across the globe, the Kaohsiung County said
Tuesday that it favors such an adjustment to tackle rising food prices at home.</P>
      <P>Huang Sheng-wei, head of the Kaohsiung County government's agricultural affairs
department, made the remarks while reporting at a meeting with ranking county
officials.</P>
      <P>Huang said he will suggest the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency drop its fallow
policy and slash subsidies for fallow farmland to encourage farmers to restart
cultivation or to release their land plots for organic or competitive
plantation.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan is a traditional agricultural area, with as
much as 8,000 hectares of farmland. In recent years, some 4,200 hectares of the
farmland were allowed to remain fallow for the first harvest, while 7,200
hectares were left unseeded for the second crop.</P>
      <P>COA chairman-designate Chen Wu-hsiung told CNA in an exclusive interview early
last week that under his leadership, the COA will aim to "build public health,
boost agricultural competitiveness and enhance sustainable growth" to
reinvigorate Taiwan's agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>Chen said that increasing Taiwan's food output will be his short-term objective
after he assumes office as part of the incoming Kuomintang government May 20.</P>
      <P>According to the incoming COA chief, some 220,000 hectares of farmland across
Taiwan have been lying fallow.</P>
      <P>Echoing  Chen's remarks,  Huang Yu-tsai,  director  of the Agriculture and Food
Agency, said last week that the government would consider resuming cultivation
of fallow rice paddies to help curb an increasing food shortage around the
world.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the government could allow rice paddies that have lain
fallow to be plowed at any time, although it had adjusted its rice production
policy by encouraging rice farmers not to plant after Taiwan entered the World
Trade Organization and began allowing imports of rice from abroad.</P>
      <P>According to COA Vice Chairman Lee Jen-chyuan, the COA projects the use of up to
30,000 hectares of the country's fallow farmland to grow corn in 2008, and
another 20,000 hectares and 16,000 hectares will be used for cultivating rice
and for forestation, respectively.</P>
      <P>The COA is planning to urge farmers to grow corn for corn feed on 12,000
hectares of the fallow farmland this year and on 30,000 hectares next year, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>The rest of the fallow farmland will be used to produce other kinds of grains
that will not cause a glut in the domestic market, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Compared to other Asian countries, Taiwan's rice prices have remained relatively
stable, having increased by some 13 percent this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang expressed regret Tuesday over the World
Health Organization's (WHO's) decision to return President  Chen Shui-bian's
letter seeking membership for Taiwan in the organization.</P>
      <P>The letter, in which the president expressed the country's intention to join the
world health body as a full member under the name Taiwan, or at least as an
observer in its decision-making body -- the World Health Assembly -- was sent to
WHO Director-General Margaret Chen on April 17, according Ministry of Foreign
Affairs spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh.</P>
      <P>The letter was received by the WHO Secretariat on April 23 and then passed on to
the WHO's Headquarters in Geneva before being sent back to Taiwan, she said.</P>
      <P>Speaking with reporters Tuesday, Huang said the request for observer status in
the organization illustrates Taiwan's "sincerity and flexibility" on the issue,
and he expressed regret over the WHO's rejection of the letter.</P>
      <P>He said that the Taiwan government has been communicating with its diplomatic
allies and other major countries to support its WHO bid.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the United States does not support Taiwan applying for full
membership in the WHO but does support, in principle, the granting of observer
status in the WHA.</P>
      <P>He added that as Taiwan has adopted a two-pronged strategy regarding its WHO bid
this year -- namely requesting observer status in the WHA while at the same time
pushing for full membership -- the United States has yet to make a decision on
whether to support Taiwan's efforts.</P>
      <P>As for the European  Union,  Huang said that it supports "meaningful
participation" by Taiwan in the WHO, but that it has so far maintained a
reserved attitude on Taiwan's bid for observer status in the WHA.</P>
      <P>The WHA's annual conference is slated to be held in Geneva May 19-24.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the government is making an all out effort to gain the support
of major countries for Taiwan's bid and that its diplomatic allies will submit a
proposal at the WHA meeting for Taiwan to be granted observer status.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung County to establish first 'English village' in June</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, April 29 (CNA)
04/29/08  18:19:25
(By Nick Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An "English village" will be established at Tsai Wen Elementary School in Luchu
Township, southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung county in June, aiming to offer students a
unique, full-immersion experience, Kaohsiung Deputy Magistrate Yeh Nan-ming said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The village will be the first of its kind in the county, with several others to
be set up in Kaohsiung in the near future. Few such schools exist in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The facility will enable students to practice real life English - including how
to use English to order food in restaurants, mail a letter at the post office
and shop for groceries in a supermarket, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The plan comes as public schools in Taiwan are facing pressure to improve
English instruction. Many Taiwanese parents spend a lot of money to send their
children to privately-run after school English tutorial centers, which employ
foreigners, because they believe the standard of instruction in public schools
is not up to par.</P>
      <P>The "English villages" aims to offer students an overseas experience, without
the high costs and problems of sending young children abroad to English-speaking
countries.</P>
      <P>The Tasi Wen Elementary School in Kaohsiung, for example, will have a one-day
"English tour" that will include meals and boarding for the students, to give
them a chance to experience what it would be like to study abroad.</P>
      <P>Teachers will include foreigners as well as local instructors.</P>
      <P>The language of instruction and communication will be English, unlike Taiwan's
regular schools, where English is only spoken during English class in the
classroom.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the English village is aimed at sharpening not only
students', but also teachers', English speaking and listening abilities, Yeh
added.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwanese English teachers get little opportunity to practice
speaking English and it is hoped that by putting them in an environment with
expatriate teachers, they will also have an opportunity to improve their English
skills and therefore become better at teaching English.</P>
      <P>Yeh's remarks came during a meeting at the Kaohsiung County Hall for directors
of the county's agencies where he advised the county's education department to
prepare local English teachers for teaching at the villages, especially their
English conversation ability.</P>
      <P>Following the opening of the first English village, the county government will
also establish several English villages in the county's Fengshan, Gangshan and
Chishan districts in the near future to offer English courses for more students,
an official of the county's Education Department said at the meeting.</P>
      <P>The English villages in Kangshan district, for example, will allow students to
sharpen their spoken English in various contexts, including airport customs, in-
flight, hotels, restaurants, bookstores, banks, post offices, on the MRT, buses,
taxis, supermarkets, movie theaters and hospitals, Yeh noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Democracy Hall's fate up to public: incoming education minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Education Minister-designate Cheng Jei-cheng said Tuesday that the fate of the
National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall will be decided by public opinion after
he assumes his post May 20.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who was named minister of education by Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan
Monday, made the remarks in response to questions by reporters.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he will address the issue right after he takes office, but added that
he does not expect a quick resolution and will leave the decisions up to the
public.</P>
      <P>The minister-designate  was referring  to the controversial renaming of the
National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall, which was formerly known as the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which
sees the old name as a symbol of authoritarianism associated with the late
President Chiang Kai-shek, renamed the complex last year amid protests by the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its supporters.</P>
      <P>Chiang is considered by many to be the mastermind behind the 228 Incident -- an
uprising against what was called a corrupt KMT administration. The incident,
which began Feb. 28, 1947 and resulted in the murder of thousands of civilians,
led to four decades of martial law rule by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Noting that the minister of education (MOE) should not be involved in politics
and elections, Cheng said he will not make any decisions on his own in this
regard.</P>
      <P>"Many creative ideas can be obtained through dialogue within the society," Cheng
said.</P>
      <P>In response to questions regarding his views on rolling back the DPP
government's desinicization campaign that included renaming many state-run
enterprises, Cheng stressed that "culture and educational affairs should not be
guided by politics. On the contrary, they should be guided by tolerance and
diversity and should evolve in a natural way."</P>

      <P>The Council for Hakka Affairs released a new book "A Fast Read on Hakkas in
Taiwan" Monday with the aim of helping Hakka people gain a better understanding
of their homeland and establish their own identity, while spurring the
development of Hakka communities.</P>
      <P>The publication, comprised of some 600,000 words and more than 300 photos, is
the country's first book that features Taiwan's history from the perspective of
the Hakkas, the council's Chairman Lee Yung-te said at the book launch.</P>
      <P>The council commissioned the book in view of the growing need for an easy
reading account that would comprehensively and clearly introduce Hakka culture
and affairs.</P>
      <P>It was adapted from the book, "An Introduction to Taiwanese Hakka Studies,"
previously published by the council and the Association for Taiwan Hakka
Studies.</P>
      <P>The easy-to-read version, which focuses on the themes of history, economic life,
society and culture,  literature and arts, and contemporary  Hakka developments,
recounts  the Hakka people's participation in various events in Taiwan's
history. It also looks at their achievements in political, economic, business
and artistic areas, as well as in the realms of literature, architecture and
social movements.</P>
      <P>"Although the Hakka people have never been excluded from the many important
incidents and activities in Taiwan's history, they have been often overlooked,"
lamented the book's author Hsue Yun-fung, who is a lecturer at Hsuan Chuang
University.</P>
      <P>"Until recently, there were only a couple of research papers about Taiwanese
Hakkas, but not many people read them," Hsue said.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, the author said, he spent several months rewriting and
compiling the book based on material written by academics who specialize in
Hakka culture and affairs.</P>
      <P>Tai Pao-tsun, a member of a book review committee who is also Hakka, said he
hopes that the book will give more people better information about Hakkas -- the
second largest ethnic group in Taiwan -- and help give visibility to the
diversified aspects of Taiwan's history.</P>

      <P>Marking the 10-year milestone of its launch, a team of leading scholars from the
Beijing-based Microsoft Research Asia (MRA) held a forum in Taiwan Tuesday and
pledged on behalf of the American software giant to expand academia-industry
collaboration in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lolan Song, a senior director of a unit of the Beijing-based institution,
expressed her commitment to expand cooperation with Taiwan's  academic
institutions,  noting the MRA has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with
Taiwan's top research universities including National Taiwan University,
National Tsing Hua University and National Chiao Tung University.</P>
      <P>"We are looking forward to continuing and expanding the academic collaboration
with Taiwan," she noted</P>
      <P>"Our labs of experts have worked with a total of 59 universities in the Asia
Pacific, " she added, noting research collaboration aims to build a long-term
mutual benefit with Asia's academia and to serve as a bridge between the MRA's

      <P>She was speaking at the "Globalization Forum" where Microsoft announced the
winners of the Microsoft Research Fellowship Award. The award is given to
scholars who stand out among the 350 MRA researchers in terms of their research.</P>

      <P>Referring to the current 700 MSR researchers worldwide, Hon said these scholars'
main task is to transform  innovations  into application, "in a bid to allow
users around the globe to enjoy the newest software technologies with ease."</P>
      <P>Following the first Microsoft lab established in 1991, Bill Gates, the founder

      <P>The Metal Industries Research and Development Center under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, together with local eyewear industry leaders, formed an
alliance Tuesday for research  and development  of high value-added  eyewear-
related products.</P>
      <P>Economic officials said the goal of the alliance is to reach self-sufficiency in
terms of technology for the entire production process.</P>
      <P>At least six optical companies in southern Taiwan have joined the alliance,
pledging to develop new higher-value-added products within two years so that
Taiwan's eyewear manufacturers will be less susceptible to competition from low-
value products made in China and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Among the founding member companies are Jiann Lih Optical Co. and Hwa Meei
Optical Co., both located in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the alliance will concentrate on the development of high-
valued industrial safety glasses to tackle the nearly NT$100 billion world
market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan used to be the world leader in the production of sunglasses in the 1970s,
but many manufacturers moved overseas in the 1980s, with some 100 transferring
their production bases to China. At present, Taiwan still has 123 companies
involved in the production of a wide range of eyewear products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China should seize chance to improve ties with Taiwan: U.S. scholar</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>China should seize the opportunity of Ma Ying-jeou's election as president to
improve cross-strait relations, said a U.S. scholar, Bonnie Glaser, Tuesday,
stressing that it will also benefit the United States and create "win-win-win
dynamics" among the three nations.</P>
      <P>Glaser is a senior associate at the Washington Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) , as well as with Pacific Forum CSIS in Honolulu,
Hawaii. Pacific Forum CSIS was founded in 1975 with the aim of helping to
stimulate cooperative policies in the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>In her latest article entitled "If Not Now, When? Will China Seize the
Opportunity to Improve Cross-Strait Relations" that was sent to the CNA Tuesday,
Glaser described Ma's victory and the failure of two referendums in the Mar. 22
elections as "a historic and strategic opportunity  for China to transform
cross-Strait relations."</P>
      <P>"The United States hopes that Beijing will respond positively to the new
situation and without delay," Glaser said.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ticket of Ma and Vincent Siew won a landslide
victory with 7,658,724 votes, or 58. 45 percent of the ballots cast in the
presidential  election.  Two controversial referendums on Taiwan's quest for
U.N. membership held alongside the president election failed to pass the legal
threshold.</P>
      <P>Glaser suggested that as Ma and the KMT are eager to press forward first on
their economic agenda, China should move fast or it "may deprive Ma and the KMT
of the backing they need to sustain a policy approach that has not yet won the
support of the 42 percent of Taiwanese voters who cast their votes for the DPP
(the ruling Democratic Progressive Party)."</P>
      <P>According to Ma, launching direct flights between Taiwan and China, allowing
more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, relaxing the controls on Taiwan
investment in China, avoiding double taxation on people doing business on both
sides of the strait, improving financial services for businessmen based in
China, and initiating currency exchange mechanisms would be his administration's
priorities after it takes office on May 20.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's pursuit of greater international space, Glaser said that the
World Health Assembly meeting on May 19, one day prior to Ma's inauguration,
would be an early opportunity for China to make a "goodwill gesture."</P>
      <P>She said that incumbent President Chen Shui-bian's decision to apply again for
both membership and observership in the world health body using the name Taiwan
will "likely let Beijing off the hook this year. She however suggested that "an
arrangement could be worked out for "the WHA to grant observer status to Taiwan
under the name 'Chinese Taipei' on the second or third day of the session."</P>
      <P>But, she said, based on conversations with Chinese officials, China may offer
Taiwan "only limited participation in international organizations in ways that
can be easily reversed, " in fear that the DPP could return to power.</P>
      <P>"Such a decision would undoubtedly disappoint the United States, not to mention
the Taiwan people," Glaser said in the article.</P>
      <P>She further suggested that the competition between Taiwan and China for
diplomatic allies "should end immediately" in order improve cross-strait
relations, preserve the trust in Ma among his supporters and engender the trust
of the 42 percent of the electorate that voted for the DPP.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Glaser said that even if military or national security issues are not
likely to be dealt with right away, the Beijing authorities should "take steps
to signal good will" by "declaring a freeze on missile deployments, " before any
formal cross-strait talks are launched.</P>
      <P>"Once we decide to negotiate a peace agreement, it will be embarrassing if more
than 1,000 missiles are targeting us, " Glaser quoted Ma as saying.</P>
      <P>The scholar stated that an easing of cross-strait tensions will reduce the
chances of a cross-strait war that would likely involve the U.S.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan can become a less contentious issue between Beijing and Washington,
this will also benefit U.S. interests," she stated.</P>
      <P>"China should avoid seeking to extract unreasonable concessions from Taipei that
would undercut support for Ma Ying-jeou," she said.</P>
      <P>To realize the opportunity for better triangular relations, "wise and far-
sighted leadership on all three sides" is essential, she added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A new DNA chip developed by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
might be the first of its kind to be able to detect in a few days 10 target
bacteria that multiply in indoor air, greatly reducing the examination time, EPA
staff said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"So far as I know, foreign countries have not yet used the DNA chip for air
quality examination, " said Hong Wen-zong, in charge of the chip project
conducted by the Environmental Analysis Laboratory under the EPA.</P>
      <P>The chip, smaller than a NT$1 coin, has 10 probes, each containing DNA elements
of one of the 10 target bacteria, he said.</P>
      <P>"Using the DNA chip, we can greatly reduce the examination time from one month
to several days, " Hong said, adding that since each probe on the chip
corresponds to one type of bacteria,  the researchers no longer need to do tests
on one bacteria type after another.</P>
      <P>To examine the air quality, researchers take air samples and collect the
bacteria from the samples for culture. After several days, researchers obtain
the DNA of the bacteria and use the chip to test if the air samples contain the
target bacteria, Hong explained.</P>
      <P>The 10 target bacteria,  including aspergillus  versicolor, aspergillus
fumigatus, aspergillus flavus and stachybotrys chartarum, can cause several
diseases, such as corneitis, asthma, allergies and skin irritations, Hong added.</P>
      <P>Hong further said that once an indoor air quality management act is passed by
the Legislative Yuan, the EPA will apply the technique, giving  priority  to
classrooms  in  elementary  schools  and kindergartens.</P>

      <P>Non-toxic agricultural produce produced in Hualien County, eastern Taiwan, is to
target a new market -- China -- after gaining support from many local and
foreign consumers, a county official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tu Li-hua, director of the Hualien county government's Department of
Agriculture, said the county government is pushing exports of its non-toxic
agricultural products -- which the county government said requires stricter
examination standards than organic agricultural produce -- to Shanghai.</P>
      <P>According to Tu, the non-toxic agriculture policy adopted by the county
government four years ago has also gained the recognition of President-elect Ma
Ying-jeou, who promised during his election campaign to make Taiwan's
agriculture wholly non-toxic within 50 years.</P>
      <P>"During the promotion process, the incoming government will emulate Hualien's
example," Tu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, a visit made by Hualien Magistrate Hsieh Shen-san and a delegation
to Canada last October to promote Hualien's non-toxic agricultural produce has
also borne favorable results, according to Tu.</P>
      <P>The county government's plan to seek a new outlet for its non-toxic agricultural
produce was inspired by Vice President-elect Vincent Siew, who visited Hualien
recently and suggested that the county government export its non-toxic
agricultural products to Hong Kong and cities along China's southeastern coast,
as well as to Japan and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Hualien is well-known for its natural beauty and less polluted land and air,
conditions that are favorable for the development of non-toxic agricultural
products that require a record of information on origin, production process and
pesticide check results.</P>

      <P>Education Minister-designate Cheng Jei-cheng pledged Tuesday to help students
enjoy studying after he assumes his post.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, this is a high goal although it may sound like a simple
idea, because it involves lightening the stress load on students while ensuring
their performance does not decline.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks in his first interview with the media since his
appointment was announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The former National Chengchi University president said he had not expected he
would become Taiwan's education minister, as he thought Premier-designate Liu
Chao-shiuan had approached him to ask him for advice on possible candidates for
the position.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Liu instead offered him the position and he decided to accept it
after discovering that Liu's education philosophy was similar to his own.</P>
      <P>Both Liu and himself agree that education should not be subject to influence
from outside forces or be involved in politics and elections, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>On President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's promise to set up a committee to review the
progress of the country's education reforms, Cheng said he prefers setting up a
platform similar to the National Council for Sustainable Development to allow
discussions on educational issues.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L. Chen said Tuesday that it is very
possible that the domestic petroleum price will be held steady next month.</P>
      <P>Chen's words came amid a continued surge in the price of world crude oil to
nearly US$120 a barrel.</P>
      <P>Domestic petroleum price has been frozen since December and the state-owned
petroleum supplier, CPC Corp., Taiwan, has continued to lose money due to
surging global oil prices.</P>
      <P>In late March, CPC Corp. sought approval from the government to lift the freeze
on a floating oil price mechanism to hike petroleum product price, without
success.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Formosa Petrochemical Corp. -- Taiwan's sole private fuel
supplier -- has adjusted the prices of its petroleum products upwards.</P>
      <P>According to the calculations of the CPC Corp., the prices of petroleum and
diesel fuel should have been hiked by NT$3.4 and NT$3.7 per liter, respectively,
as of last week if currency exchange rates are taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>The CPC adopted a floating pricing mechanism in January 2007 under which it
adjusted its domestic fuel prices on a weekly basis in response to crude oil
price surges in the world market. Formosa Petrochemical usually adjusted its
prices in line with CPC's moves.</P>
      <P>The system was then replaced by a monthly adjustment mechanism last September.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs ordered a freeze on the floating mechanism in
November 2007 out of fear that continuous hikes would fan inflationary
pressures.</P>
      <P>Vice President-elect Vincent Siew and Economic Affairs Minister-designate Yiin
Chii-ming have said that after assuming their posts on May 20, deciding what to
do about the petroleum price will be one of the priorities, and any price
increase will be done "in one step" instead of in a piecemeal way.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's housing market could be heating up in anticipation of greater cross-
strait economic activity, but consumer capacity is the key to sustaining a
potential long-term rise, industry leaders said at a forum Tuesday.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou and his incoming Kuomintang (KMT) government, which
will take the office May 20, have pledged to relax cross-strait regulations to
promote economic exchanges with China. They have promised to introduce measures
such as allowing more tourists from China to visit Taiwan and to permit China
nationals to invest in Taiwan real estate -- initiatives that are expected to
result in an increase in local property prices.</P>
      <P>"Despite the current economic slowdown, local outstanding loans rose to the
highest-ever figure of NT$4.6 trillion last year, " said Timothy Y.S. Ma, the
chairman and CEO of Kindom Construction Corp. This indicates that there is hot
demand in the housing market, he noted.</P>
      <P>He urged the incoming administration to allow Chinese investors to purchase
residential property in Taiwan, "and at the same time boost the local capacity
and confidence of consumers, which will be the key to a potential rise in
housing prices."</P>
      <P>Billy Yen, general manager of a real-estate consultancy, Debenham Tie Leung
International Property Advisors, echoed Timothy Ma's sentiments, saying the
KMT's commitment to more open economic relations with China has helped to
restore consumer confidence and boost overseas investment. However, low-and-
middle wage earners should be taken care of in the process of expanding the
housing market, Yen added.</P>
      <P>"Housing prices have been rising at a rate that outstrips regular wage earnings
in Taiwan," Yen noted.</P>
      <P>"In the face of global inflationary pressure, the government should take
measures to keep housing prices affordable for the younger generation, " Yen
stressed, citing Ma Ying-jeou' s pledge to spur economic growth of six percent
and raise the annual national income to US$30, 000.</P>
      <P>However, scholars at the forum said that the property market is on the verge of
a slowdown.</P>
      <P>"Housing supply has gradually exceeded demand, " said Chuang Meng-han, an
economics professor at Tamkang University, referring to the 87.83 percent house
ownership rate as a sign of the saturated housing market.</P>
      <P>Chuang said he has observed a market trend that targets the extremely rich,
which he said suggests an M-shaped society in which the middle class is
eliminated.</P>
      <P>"This trend has led to skyrocketing housing prices in certain parts of Taipei
City, with the price per ping (3.3 square meters) reaching NT$1.5 million in
some areas, " Chuang said, adding that there might also be a possible trend of
housing market segmentation in the country.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislators voiced  grave  concern  Tuesday  that
the  appointment  of a pro-independence former lawmaker to a key post in the
incoming KMT government will disrupt the planned opening of direct weekend
charter flights between Taiwan and China July 4.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Kuo-liang, acting whip of the KMT's legislative caucus, made the remarks
while answering reporters' questions on the issue.</P>
      <P>The designation of former Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) lawmaker Lai Hsing-yuan
as chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has sparked disputes from
within the KMT, which fears that Lai's past pro-independence stance would ruin
possible cooperative plans between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou, who will assume the presidency May 20, has vowed
to establish direct weekend charter flights across the strait and open Taiwan
further to Chinese tourists -- both from July 4 -- as well as to remove the 40
percent ceiling on China-bound investment by Taiwanese companies. The three
issues are of major concern to Taiwan's public in terms of cross-strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT legislative caucus is worried about Lai's political ideology,
Hsieh reminded her that she has to deliver on Ma's election promises.</P>
      <P>Hsieh urged Lai to made it clear what she meant when she commented a day earlier
in an interview that it is necessary to put complementary measures in place if
the investment cap is to be abolished.</P>
      <P>"Lai must provide a clear explanation in this regard as soon as possible to
assuage grave concerns in Taiwan's business community, which has long hoped for
such relaxations to be implemented, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, although Lai is still a TSU member, she now shares his
viewpoint of "no unification, no independence and no use of force" concerning
the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Later that same day, KMT spokesman Huang Yu-chen announced that the party's
Wednesday weekly meeting of its powerful Central Standing Committee (CSC) had
been canceled.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the KMT decided Monday not to hold the weekly CSC meeting
due to a "lack of discussion topics."</P>
      <P>He denied speculation that the meeting's cancellation  had something to do with
Lai's surprise appointment as MAC chairwoman.</P>

      <P>A local group has vowed to keep monitoring the legislature on behalf of the
public, even though opposition Kuomintang (KMT)  lawmakers blasted it for
purposefully citing incorrect information to smear them.</P>
      <P>Citizen Congress Watch (CCW) said in a statement issued Monday that it obtained
all of its data from the legislature's Web site for its weekly reports to
evaluate the performance of lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The group also said it indicated in the reports that it welcomed phone calls to
correct any mistake it made and that it did make some corrections on issues it
raised.</P>
      <P>The group urged lawmakers to work with it to make the information about
legislative meetings more accurate and transparent.</P>
      <P>The statement  came after the legislature's  transportation committee passed a
resolution initiated by KMT Legislator Chen Ken-te to list the group as an
unwelcome organization at the committee's meeting earlier in the day in response
to the group's allegedly misquoting data.</P>
      <P>Due to the group's frequent criticisms, the committee and other committees have
already banned the group from attending their meetings prior to the resolution.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Kuo-liang, acting secretary-general of the KMT caucus, also lambasted the
group at a press conference the same day for launching an online poll, in which
he said lawmakers were depicted as "wild dogs" or "rats."</P>
      <P>The dispute was sparked by the group's April 24 report on lawmakers' meeting
attendance records, which said many legislative committees often started their
meetings late.</P>
      <P>On average, legislative committees held meetings 9.4 minutes late, the report
said, adding that the transportation committee had the worst record among the
legislature's eight committees as it held meetings 28 minutes late on average.</P>
      <P>On March 31, the transportation committee held a meeting 114 minutes later than
scheduled, according to the report.</P>
      <P>It also accused Chen, a member of the committee, of having the worst attendance
record among all lawmakers from Feb. 1-March 31.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said that the transportation committee did not delay its
meeting on March 31, but rather called a two-hour closed door meeting from 9: 06
a.m. that day.</P>
      <P>He has demanded the group make a correction.</P>
      <P>The group said in the Monday statement that it would run a correction and offer
its sincere apology to Chen, but contended that it did not fabricate the
information and that the legislature's Web site did not indicate when the secret
meeting was held.</P>
      <P>On its online poll asking voters to compare the image of lawmakers to animals,
the group also explained that there were a number of animals with positive
images, such as the "eagle" and the "camel," for the public to choose from.</P>
      <P>However, a majority of voters chose "rat, " which the group said should prompt
lawmakers to reflect on themselves rather than respond angrily.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers, the group said, should not use allegations of "wrong information"
presented by the group as an excuse to avoid being monitored.</P>
      <P>Citizen Congress Watch, comprised of more than 30 civic groups, stressed that it
did not intend to favor or attack any specific political party, urging lawmakers
to offer easy access for the public to learn about legislative meetings.</P>
      <P>It is appealing to the legislature to allow its members to attend all
legislative committees' meetings.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will climb Taiwan's highest mountain, Yushan, in early
May to promote the 3,952-meter-high mountain as a symbol of Taiwan, an aide said
Tuesday.</P>

the Jade Mountain, in central Taiwan, as his eight-year tenure expires May 20,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Chen is also well prepared for the activity, as he has had several training
sessions on Yangming Mountain in suburban Taipei, Lin told reporters after a
news conference at the Presidential Office to launch an exhibition  featuring
models of Taiwan's classic buildings and diverse cultures.</P>
      <P>Chen wants the trip to symbolize a salute to the land of Taiwan and a renewal of
his vow to continue to serve the people, Lin explained.</P>
      <P>Describing Yushan as having a unique and noble significance because of its
natural environment and history, Lin noted that an increasing number of young
people have climbed Yushan to celebrate their adulthood.</P>
      <P>People from Japan and the European countries also like to visit the mountain, he
observed.</P>
      <P>Accompanying Chen will be Presidential Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen, another
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Chen Chi-mai and other presidential
aides, Lin said, adding that he will not be making the climb.</P>
      <P>He said that it is safe to climb the mountain, but it depends on the weather to
see if Chen can top the peak in a three-day trip.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Low blood sugar a problem for diabetics: doctor</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
04/29/08  21:44:58

    <TEXT>
      <P>Low blood sugar, an outcome of excessive blood sugar control for diabetics, is a
bigger factor than high blood sugar among diabetics seeking emergency treatment,
a doctor said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wayne Huey-herng Sheu, president of the Taiwanese Association of Diabetes
Educators, said a 78-year-old diabetic in central Taiwan required emergency
treatment as a result of low blood sugar earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The patient's  low blood  sugar  came about  from  taking sulfonylureas, an
anti-diabetic drug used to control blood sugar, along with going to bed without
eating, Sheu said, who is also director-general of Taichung Veterans General
Hospital's Department of Internal Medicine.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the results of a survey conducted by Taiwan's 17 hospitals among 609
patients with Type II -- adult-onset -- diabetes from January to June last year,
show that 29 percent of the respondents had a low blood sugar incident at least
once a year.</P>
      <P>Diabetes is characterized by disordered metabolism and abnormally high blood
sugar resulting from low levels of the hormone insulin. The disease has three
types: Type I -- insulin-dependent diabetes; Type II -- non-insulin-dependent
diabetes; and gestational diabetes occurring during pregnancy. Only Type II
patients can take medication to control their diabetes.</P>
      <P>The results also show that 23 percent of the respondents thought low blood sugar
caused them serious inconvenience in their everyday lives, while 68 percent-85
percent of the respondents had long-term dissatisfaction with their blood sugar
level control.</P>
      <P>Sheu pointed out that these patients usually take medicine before meals but
sometimes forget to eat or take too much exercise, thus causing low blood sugar
levels.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Mei-chen, a public health nurse at the Mackay Memorial
Hospital in Taipei City, carrying candies or sweets is always lesson one in
first aid for diabetics.</P>
      <P>She added that high-calorie chocolate, cookies without speedy effects in
increasing blood sugar, 500 c.c. juice cans that have too much sugar and sugar
substitute, are not suggested.</P>
      <P>Chang said there is medicine on the market that helps stabilize blood sugar
levels, but it is expensive, with one tablet costing more than NT$70.</P>
      <P>She said patients can still seek good control of blood sugar levels through diet
and regular exercise.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Tuesday that she has yet to make a final decision
on whether she will visit Beijing next month to attend an international travel
fair in the Chinese capital.</P>
      <P>Chen said she remains neutral on the issue but added that she has asked the
city's Economic Affairs Bureau to make full preparations for the 2008 Beijing
travel expo from June 19-21, in which the Kaohsiung city government has rented
12 booths to set up a Kaohsiung Pavilion to sell the southern port city to
Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>However, she made clear that she must be treated on an equal footing with parity
and dignity by the Beijing authorities if she makes the visit "for the sake of
Kaohsiung City's interests."</P>
      <P>It was reported that Chen, of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , will lead a delegation to Beijing for the fair that will include
Economic  Affairs Bureau Director  Liu Hsin-cheng  and representatives  from the
local tourism-related businesses.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said they will submit an application in mid-May to ask
permission from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) to take part in
the travel fair.</P>
      <P>However, the officials declined to say whether they will also seek MAC approval
for Chen to make the trip.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have remained under separate rule and have been at loggerheads
since 1949, when the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan after its defeat in the
Chinese civil war.</P>

      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recorded 14 new enterovirus cases last
week, and the situation may worsen this summer, said CDC Deputy Director Chou
Jih-haw Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The CDC has recorded 53 cases so far this year, with one death occurring in
March in Yunlin County, central Taiwan, Chou noted.</P>
      <P>"The epidemic is likely to escalate, and may reach its peak in the 23rd to 24th
week of the year which fall in mid June," he said.</P>
      <P>The 14 new cases registered last week were mostly children under the age of 6
living in southern Taiwan, with five cases recorded in Tainan City and three in
Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan this year, Kaohsiung County has recorded 15 cases of

    <HEADLINE>Porject approved to provide free vaccination for children, elderly</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) approved Monday a
national vaccine fund project proposed by the Department of Health (DOH) to give
free vaccinations to children and the elderly.</P>
      <P>Under the project, the government will invest NT$9.18 billion (US$301.97
million) over five years starting 2009 to finance four free vaccinations in
addition to the current eight publicly funded vaccines already available, CEPD
officials said.</P>
      <P>The four free vaccines will be a new pertussis vaccine, a pneumococcus vaccine,
five-in-one or six-in-one vaccines, and a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine
given to people aged over 65.</P>
      <P>The government will channel the funding over five years, with a budget of NT$800
million for 2009 that will prioritize a new pertussis vaccine for newborns and a
pneumococcus vaccine for for high risk children aged under five.</P>
      <P>In 2010, the government will introduce five-in-one or six-in-one vaccines for
children aged under two, while in 2012 it will introduce combined pneumococcus
vaccines and the following year will introduce pneumococcal polysaccharide
vaccine for people over 65.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said the new pertussis vaccine will benefit 200,000 newborns every
year, the pneumococcus vaccine will benefit 10,000 children, the five-in-one or
six-in-one vaccines will benefit 400,000 children, and the vaccine for those
over 65 will benefit 3.5 million elderly people.</P>
      <P>Although Wang Yung-ching, founder of the Formosa Plastics Group, has donated
578,000 doses of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for those aged over 65, the
number of doses is still insufficient, and the DOH is planning to give the free
shots to those over 75 from this year.</P>
      <P>Vaccines are the most effective health investment,  health officials said. It is
estimated that vaccinating high risk children under five will cut the number of
hospital visits and the mortality rate, providing savings of NT$1.5 billion in
medical expenses per year, while the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for the
elderly will help cut medical costs by NT$1 billion every year.</P>
      <P>Health officials said that with limited financial means, Taiwan has only added
such free shots as three-in-one vaccine, flu vaccine and smallpox vaccine in
nearly a decade.</P>
      <P>The new vaccine fund will have government funding of 60 percent, private
donations will account for 15 percent, the tobacco health tax will account for
20 percent and the remaining 5 percent will come from other sources.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run petroleum company CPC Corp., Taiwan (CPC) is to set its sights on
Canadian oil sand in an effort to cope with soaring oil prices, a company
spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The oil company plans to earmark NT$24 billion (US$789 million) over the next
five years from this year to set up a joint venture to exploit oil sand in
Canada, said CPC Vice President Arthur Kung.</P>
      <P>It will be CPC's first oil sand exploitation project, Kung said, predicting that
the amount of funding will give CPC a stake of only 20 percent to 40 percent in
the joint venture.</P>
      <P>However, the company has yet to determine which company it will collaborate with
or the investment objective, Kung went on.</P>
      <P>According to the company, oil sand can produce heavy oil and thus is regarded as
an alternative source of energy.</P>
      <P>Oil sand can contain 8 percent to 12 percent oil, with the rest made up of sand
and water.</P>
      <P>Studies show that the exploitation of oil sand can generate profits when
international oil prices surpass US$65 a barrel. As a result, many countries are
engaging in oil sand exploitation as oil prices are already approaching US$120
per barrel.</P>
      <P>At present, Canada, Venezuela and Russia have the largest deposits of oil sand.
Canada, which offers more stable political and economic environments than the
other two countries, has attracted more than 30 large oil companies seeking to
exploit the reserves.</P>
      <P>Canada produces some 1 million barrels of heavy oil from its oil sand daily and
the country's oil sand deposits are estimated to be enough to last for 450
years, even if Canada doubles its output to 2 million barrels a day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Textbook disputes challenge education minister-designate</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Education-designate Cheng Jei-cheng was faced with the thorny issue
Tuesday of whether to maintain a long-criticized textbook policy -- one set of
guidelines for textbook publishers but with schools allowed to choose from
multiple texts -- in his first meeting with the media after his appointment was
announced.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that he prefers the "one guide-multiple text" concept, despite the
controversy, for junior high and elementary school textbooks, but admitted there
are still many problems to be fixed.</P>
      <P>The former president of National Chengchi University, who is sometimes described
as a "philosopher university president" was named to the incoming Cabinet
members a day earlier by Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>Cheng was asked to talk on the second day of his appointment about his opinions
on the dispute surrounding the "one guide-one text" and "one guide-multiple
text" policies.</P>
      <P>The "one guide-one text" means school education is based on a single version of
a textbook, while the "multiple texts" option allows school teachers to select
their materials from a variety of different versions of a textbook.</P>
      <P>The  government  began  to  implement  the  policy  of "one-guide-multiple text"
in elementary schools in 2000, expanding to junior high school the following
year in order to address the rights of students to a broader education as part
of its education reforms.</P>
      <P>However, the policy has been criticized as increasing students' learning and
financial burdens because they are required to read various different versions
of textbooks if they want better academic performance.</P>
      <P>The move of allowing private publishers to produce textbooks based on the
education authorities-regulated guideline has also caused problems, such as
rising textbook prices and the marketing of badly written or compiled textbooks,
the critics claim.</P>
      <P>To settle the increasing outcry against the "one guide-multiple text" practice,
the Taipei city government has decided to revert to the old method of adopting a
single version of a textbook in the city's nine-year compulsory education system
from the beginning of the new school year in September.</P>
      <P>In his meeting with the media, Cheng said he will begin to meet with scholars
and experts in high and elementary school education the following day to gain
more understanding of the problems in the compulsory education system, including
the textbook issue.</P>
      <P>Asked about the city government's plan to adopt a textbook policy that
contradicts the Ministry of Education, the incoming minister noted that the city
and the central government will both be run by a single political party -- the
Kuomintang -- after May 20 when the new administration takes office.</P>
      <P>Therefore, whether or not the policies adopted by the central and local
governments should be identical to each other is now an issue that can be
addressed within the party, he said, adding that he will discuss the subject
with Liu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's private sector received a total of 417 major investments during the
first quarter of the year, amounting to a total of NT$341.35 billion (US$11.22
billion) and reaching 31.61 percent of the country's goal for the whole year, a
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Major investments are those with an investment amount of more that NT$5 billion,
the official noted.</P>
      <P>This year's total investment target is projected at NT$1.8 trillion, an increase
of 7.3 percent from the year-earlier level, the official went on, adding that
Taiwan also had 458 direct investments from overseas Taiwanese and foreign
investors from January to March, accounting for US$1.19 billion.</P>
      <P>According to the official the MOEA wants to see the production value of the
flexible display sector reach NT$4.92 billion by 2015, with a self-production
rate of 60 percent and a boost of NT$2 billion in annual investment from
equipment providers, as the government and enterprises have both invested in
research and development of production processes and equipment.</P>
      <P>Also, the MOEA official predicted, the IC industry, which in Taiwan is now
mature, will see its annual production value reach NT$1.58 trillion by the end
of this year, an increase of 8.8 percent from last year's figure.</P>
      <P>The official added that Taiwan will become the world's leading country in terms
of 12-inch wafer production in terms of output value once the country's
construction of 12-inch wafer plants is completed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Agricultural experts in southern Taiwan have developed another delicious new
mango variety and are trying to encourage fruit farmers to engage in large-scale
cultivation of the fruit.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsien-liang, head of the Kaohsiung District Agricultural Research and
Extension Station, disclosed Tuesday that the new mango variety, formally named
Summer Snow on April 9, has some of the characteristics of the three most
popular mango varieties -- the indigenous mango, the Irwin mango and the Chin
Hwang mango.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the Summer Snow mango, which weighs about 400 to 550 grams,
smells like the Irwin mango but tastes like the indigenous mango, while its skin
looks like the Chin Hwang mango. Its flesh, however, does not have the coarse
fiber of the indigenous mango.</P>
      <P>Experimentation on the new variety began in 2000, with the process of
cultivation, comparison and screening spanning seven years before researchers
confirmed their success in 2007.</P>
      <P>The Summer Snow flowers between late December and early February, with its
fruits maturing between May and July. The mango's flesh accounts for 75 percent
to 80 percent of its weight.</P>
      <P>Huang said the new mango variety has the potential to become one of the most
popular fruit exports from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At present,  Taiwan has about 18,000 hectares of farmland dedicated to the
plantation of mangoes, with 7,500 hectares for Irwin mangoes and 2,400 hectares
for Chin Hwang mangoes.</P>
      <P>Red-skinned Irwin mangoes, weighing about 400 grams each, are a favored fruit
not only in Taiwan, but also among consumers in Japan, South Korea, Singapore
and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan exported 15,000 metric tons of fresh mangoes to both Singapore
and Hong Kong, with Japan and South Korea each buying about half that amount.</P>

      <P>Some 1,142 cartons of tainted coconuts totalling 21 tons were sold by an
importer to retailers in Taipei County, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu County and
Kaohsiung City, the Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh Ting-hung, vice director of the Bureau of Food Safety under
the DOH, about 400 cartons of coconuts, half of which were rotten or crushed,
were sold by an importer to fruit stores, street vendors and night market
vendors in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The remaining 700 cartons were sent to Taoyuan County and Hsinchu County in
northern Taiwan, and to Kaohsiung City in the south, Hsieh said. The coconuts
are more likely to be sold at fruit stores and night markets than at chain
hypermarkets such as Carrefour and RT-Mart, he added.</P>
      <P>The DOH said that a few days ago it detected residues of the fungicide
Carbendazim in the juice and on the meat of the coconuts in the shipment, but
that the importer sold the coconuts before health officials could go to the
warehouse to follow up on the tests.</P>
      <P>@Carbendazim is used to control a broad range of diseases in crops, fruits, and

    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Tuesday
that the appointment of a former lawmaker of the "center-left" Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) into his administration will not lead to any change in his policy
toward China.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks a day after Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan announced the
appointment of Lai Hsing-yuan, 51, as chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) -- the Cabinet-level body responsible for cross-Taiwan Strait affairs.</P>
      <P>As a lawmaker from 2005-2007 with the TSU -- an ally of outgoing President Chen
Shui-bian's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , Lai has been
an outspoken advocate of strengthening Taiwan's sovereignty and identity. She
also led a series of protests against China's alleged dumping of cheap,
substandard goods in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma campaigned on promises to jump-start Taiwan's laggard economy by improving
political and economic relations  with China and political analysts have said
Lai's selection reflects Ma's hope of placating DPP supporters who fear he will
compromise Taiwan's sovereignty and push the island closer toward China.</P>
      <P>But the appointment has irritated some of Ma's KMT colleagues and pro-
unification diehards, many of whom have been Ma's staunchest supporters.</P>
      <P>In an apparent attempt to allay their doubts and indignation, Ma said he took
the initiative to recruit Lai in an effort to "expand the social basis" of his
incoming government's cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>As a former MAC vice chairman, Ma went on, he is no stranger to cross-strait
affairs and fully aware that broad social consensus is very important in
launching cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Lai agrees with his notions and ideals regarding cross-strait
relations, Ma said that "both of us support the tenets of the `no unification,
no independence and no use of force' principles in carrying out cross-strait
engagements."</P>
      <P>Discounting speculation that former President Lee Teng-hui -- the TSU's
spiritual leader -- recommended Lai to him, Ma said he took the initiative on
his own to appoint Lai. "I consulted with Lee and received his consent to
recruit Lai into my administration," said Ma, who will be sworn in May 20.</P>
      <P>"If we cannot come to terms and if we continue squabbling over our cross-strait
policy, we will be unable to sit down to talk with the other side of the
strait," Ma continued.</P>
      <P>Noting that he will govern by consultation and consensus, Ma said he believes
Lai's appointment will be "of great help to expanding the base of social
consensus on cross-strait policy."</P>
      <P>"Internal  bickering will render impossible  any meaningful cross-strait
negotiations," Ma noted, urging opponents and critics to be more tolerant and
give Lai time and room to demonstrate her ability to work effectively for cross-
strait peaceful development.</P>
      <P>Stressing that many native Taiwanese voters cast their ballots for him, Ma,
whose family came to Taiwan from China less than 60 years ago, urged his
traditional supporters to be more inclusive.</P>
      <P>"As president of all of Taiwan's people, I must be inclusive in policy
formulation, particularly on cross-strait issues that are crucial to the
country's future," Ma explained.</P>
      <P>He also urged pro-independence diehards to adopt a more positive attitude toward
Lai's new assignment, saying that when the TSU declared its decision to
transform into what it describes as a "center-left" party last year, Lai has
expressed her determination to help the disadvantaged and put aside the dispute
over unification or independence.</P>
      <P>Following her appointment Monday, Lai again said she supports Ma's platform of
seeking neither unification nor formal independence.</P>
      <P>"This stance is consistent with mainstream opinion, so I don't see a problem in
pushing forward (his) policies," she said.</P>

      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Tuesday at the annual dinner of the
American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) his commitments of 12 major construction
projects, economic reforms, closer ties with China and a schedule for opening up
direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights.</P>
      <P>Speaking at AmCham's 2008 Hsieh Nien Fan dinner in Taipei, Ma said that he
values greatly the concerns raised by AmCham in its annual Taiwan White Paper
over the past five years and that his campaign promises, such as the "i-Taiwan
12 projects, " are in alignment with the organization's suggestions.</P>
      <P>In its annual Taiwan White Papers, AmCham has appealed to the government to
resolve a broad range of legislative, regulatory and enforcement issues that
include upgrading Taiwan's infrastructure, improving cross-strait relations,
upgrading the regulatory process and protecting intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has outlined a series of strategies to solve Taiwan's stagnant
economy.</P>
      <P>"This is the time for us to say goodbye to a year of stagnation," Ma told the
members of the American business community present at the dinner. "We are
looking forward to an `economic renaissance' that we hope we can re-invent our
economy."</P>
      <P>The "i-Taiwan 12 projects" include building and linking rapid transit networks
in cities and counties around the country, turning Kaohsiung into a tariff-free
port and eco-park, turning Taichung into a center for maritime and air logistics
in the Asia-Pacific region, turning Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport into an
"air city " and developing cultural and creative industries.</P>
      <P>In addition to these 12 major projects, Ma has vowed to revive Taiwan's  economy
by  restructuring  the  service  industries, establishing a so-called "golden
flight triangle" and introducing a series of tax reforms.</P>
      <P>He noted that the policy of opening up to Chinese tourists will not only bring
in cash but also create jobs and increase mutual understanding between people on
either side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The president-elect, who is set to take office May 20, reiterated his plan of
opening up Taiwan's sky to Chinese carriers, saying that he hopes to realize the
weekend charter flights in July, with daily charter flights by the end of the
year before moving on to negotiate an air transport agreement with China on
scheduled flights.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Taiwan definitely needs to allow currency exchange
between the Chinese yuan and the new Taiwan dollar, as that will provide many
opportunities not only for cross-relations but also for Taiwan's growth.</P>
      <P>"We have all the preparations to cope with that change so that it will not be
too fast but rather gradual," he added.</P>
      <P>Besides setting up a tax reform commission after his inauguration to review the
current tax system, Ma said he will consider the imposition of an energy tax to
make Taiwan compatible with the Kyoto Protocol, even though the country is not a
signatory to the agreement.</P>
      <P>"It is vitally important to our survival, particularly in terms of our exports,"
he said.</P>
      <P>He proposed a timetable for Taiwan to keep carbon dioxide emissions at the
volume level of 2008 by 2020, slash the emissions to the level of 2000 by 2025,
and to half of the 2000 level by 2050.</P>
      <P>"This is a very tough job but I don't think we have any choice, " Ma said. "This
is something we have to do to keep up with other countries in the world."</P>
      <P>In his conclusion, Ma said that after May 20, his government will try everything
possible to not only re-invent Taiwan's economy and harmonious society but also
to rediscover the core values that the Taiwanese have cherished for centuries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and Communist Party of
China (CPC) General Secretary Hu Jintao reiterated the peaceful development of
relations between Taiwan and China when they met Tuesday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lien and Hu, who doubles as Chinese president, met in 2005 for the first time,
ending 60 years of confrontation between the parties since the KMT retreated to
Taiwan after losing a Chinese civil war to the CPC in 1949.</P>
      <P>Lien said he has strong faith and is optimistic about peaceful development
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>He recalled that he and Hu formulated five visions at their first meeting as
guidelines for the future development of cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>The KMT later translated the visions into its party policies and Hu also
mentioned the signing of a cross-strait peace deal at the CPC's 17th party
congress, both setting milestones in cross-strait relations, according to Lien.</P>
      <P>He added that the two parties have held several forums since 2005 and that this
positive interaction has resulted in the emergence of rational and practical
thinking between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Since it won landslide  victories in the legislative  and presidential polls
earlier this year, the KMT will work to fulfill its promise to realize cross-
strait peace, Lien went on, adding that peaceful development will help narrow
the gap in people's lifestyles and thinking on the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Hu responded that both sides are now moving toward peaceful development and said
it is necessary to treasure and use such a valuable opportunity.</P>
      <P>He also said cross-strait negotiations should resume as early as possible on the
basis of the so-called "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus, " a term coined by former Mainland Affairs Council Chairman
Su Chi of the KMT in 2000 as a way to skirt sovereignty  issues  in cross-strait
talks,  allows  different definitions  of Beijing's  "one China" principle,
with Taiwan interpreting "one China" as referring to its official title of
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Hu also said ahead of Lien's remarks that as long as both sides seek to build
mutual trust, value similarities over differences, put aside disputes and create
a win-win situation, China and Taiwan will find a way to resolve cross-strait
issues.</P>
      <P>He also praised Lien for his efforts to promote cross-strait exchanges and

      <P>Prominent author and formal political prisoner Bo Yang, who died Tuesday of
respiratory failure aged 89, was "the epitome of humanitarianism, " Education
Minister-designate Cheng Jei-cheng said later that day.</P>
      <P>"Bo Yang epitomized Taiwan's history and bore witness to the country's
hardships," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he paid several visits to Bo Yang. "Once I saw him squatting on a
corner writing. I was surprised at first.... Later, I came to understand that he
was accustomed to doing that. During his nine years in prison, he wrote many of
his books that way, "Cheng said.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued by the Presidential Office, President Chen Shui-bian
mourned the passing of Bo Yang, praising him as one of the leading thinkers in
Taiwan's modern history.</P>
      <P>"Bo Yang had dedicated his life to literary works and he was also concerned
about democratic values and human rights," the Presidential Office statement
said, adding that his writings and theories will have profound impact on the
later generations.</P>
      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou also paid his tribute to Bo Yang, recognizing the
essayist's life-long fight for freedom, democracy and rule of law.</P>
      <P>Bo Yang had been receiving treatment for pneumonia at Taipei's Cardinal Tien
Hospital since February and died on Tuesday, the hospital said. He is survived
by five grown-up children.</P>
      <P>Originally known as Kuo Yi-tung, Bo Yang was born in Henan in eastern China in
1920. He fled to Taiwan in 1949 when Ma Zedong's Communist Party of China took
control of the mainland in a civil war.</P>
      <P>He found work as a columnist for the Independence Evening Post, a small liberal
newspaper, but quickly ran foul of the one-party Kuomintang dictatorship of the
day after he blasted Chiang Kai-shek's government for corruption and abuse of
power.</P>
      <P>Bo Yang was jailed for nine years from 1969 following his free translation of
the American comic strip Popeye, which he used to poke fun at Chiang's refusal
to conduct open presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Bo Yang's provocative writing also led him to be attacked by the Chinese
Communists. Beijing briefly banned his 1985 book "The Ugly Chinaman and the
Crisis of Chinese Culture" and several other essay collections, claiming they
insulted the Chinese people.</P>
      <P>In many of his essays, Bo Yang told Chinese that their culture -- a source of
pride for centuries -- has many shortcomings. He criticized the Chinese as
selfish and being too willing to tolerate the abuse of power. He argued that
those qualities hurt democracy and favored authoritarian regimes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Agricultural experts in southern Taiwan have developed another delicious new
mango variety and are trying to encourage fruit farmers to engage in large-scale
cultivation of the fruit.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsien-liang, head of the Kaohsiung District Agricultural Research and
Extension Station, disclosed Tuesday that the new mango variety, formally named
Summer Snow on April 9, has some of the characteristics of the three most
popular mango varieties -- the indigenous mango, the Irwin mango and the Chin
Hwang mango.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the Summer Snow mango, which weighs about 400 to 550 grams,
smells like the Irwin mango but tastes like the indigenous mango, while its skin
looks like the Chin Hwang mango. Its flesh, however, does not have the coarse
fiber of the indigenous mango.</P>
      <P>Experimentation on the new variety began in 2000, with the process of
cultivation, comparison and screening spanning seven years before researchers
confirmed their success in 2007.</P>
      <P>The Summer Snow flowers between late December and early February, with its
fruits maturing between May and July. The mango's flesh accounts for 75 percent
to 80 percent of its weight.</P>
      <P>Huang said the new mango variety has the potential to become one of the most
popular fruit exports from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At present,  Taiwan has about 18,000 hectares of farmland dedicated to the
plantation of mangoes, with 7,500 hectares for Irwin mangoes and 2,400 hectares
for Chin Hwang mangoes.</P>
      <P>Red-skinned Irwin mangoes, weighing about 400 grams each, are a favored fruit
not only in Taiwan, but also among consumers in Japan, South Korea, Singapore
and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan exported 15,000 metric tons of fresh mangoes to both Singapore
and Hong Kong, with Japan and South Korea each buying about half that amount.</P>

04/30/08  10:48:38
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 1,142 cartons of tainted coconuts totalling 21 tons were sold by an
importer to retailers in Taipei County, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu County and
Kaohsiung City, the Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh Ting-hung, vice director of the Bureau of Food Safety under
the DOH, about 400 cartons of coconuts, half of which were rotten or crushed,
were sold by an importer to fruit stores, street vendors and night market
vendors in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The remaining 700 cartons were sent to Taoyuan County and Hsinchu County in
northern Taiwan, and to Kaohsiung City in the south, Hsieh said. The coconuts
are more likely to be sold at fruit stores and night markets than at chain
hypermarkets such as Carrefour and RT-Mart, he added.</P>
      <P>The DOH said that a few days ago it detected residues of the fungicide
Carbendazim in the juice and on the meat of the coconuts in the shipment, but
that the importer sold the coconuts before health officials could go to the
warehouse to follow up on the tests.</P>
      <P>@Carbendazim is used to control a broad range of diseases in crops, fruits, and
vegetables. Ingestion of the chemical by humans is believed to cause disruption
of hormone functions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung dismissed reports that Taiwan's lawmakers have
"nothing to do, " saying Wednesday that the Executive Yuan has submitted over
100 draft bills in the last month to the Legislative Yuan for review.</P>
      <P>Rebutting reports by some media outlets that "the legislators have nothing to do
because the caretaker administration has sent no bills, " Chang said the Cabinet
has sent 139 draft bills to the Legislative Yuan since March 28, when it resumed
operations after a recess for the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chang's Democratic Progressive Party Cabinet will step down on May 20 when the
new KMT administration is inaugurated.</P>
      <P>Many of the bills are currently bottled up in the legislature's committees,
preventing review by the lawmaking body as a whole.</P>
      <P>To expedite the screening of pending bills, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng called a meeting earlier this month to seek consensus among legislators
from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the KMT on revising the
lawmaking body's schedule.</P>
      <P>He proposed that committee meetings, instead of meetings of the whole
legislature, be held in mid-April to review draft bills so that the Legislative
Yuan will have "some bills" processed.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, it was decided that April 11, 15 and 18 -- originally
reserved for whole-legislature meetings -- were to be used for committee
meetings to review a total of 26 bills because there were no bills left over
from the previous legislature, which ended late last year, for review.</P>
      <P>The 26 bills included a central government general budget bill and several
related bills, a bill on labor insurance, an amendment on lowering taxes on rice
wine and related products, as well as an amendment to statutes regarding the
welfare of youths and children.</P>
      <P>However, because many Cabinet officials will soon step down, they have refused
to appear at committee hearings on the proposed bills, delaying their review in
committee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Planting fallow farmland will help combat energy crisis: VP-elect</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
04/30/08  13:55:48

    <TEXT>
      <P>The incoming Kuomintang (KMT) government will re-cultivate much of the Taiwan's
fallow farmland to fight spiking commodity prices and tackle the global energy
crisis, Vice President-elect Vincent Siew said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Reviving  Taiwans farmlands could help create a win-win situation to tackle
both international soaring food prices and the energy shortage, " Siew said at a
forum on food, energy, and agricultural development and their roles in boosting
the economy.</P>
      <P>Siew indicated the new government will promote genetic research to transform
rice and sugar cane, Taiwan's agricultural staples with the biomass potential,
into alternative fuels that could replace oil.</P>
      <P>The EU nations have subsidized their agriculture sectors to develop bio-energy
and plan to mandate that all mass transportation vehicles run on fuels that
contain at least 5.75 percent of biofuels by 2010, Siew said, adding that Taiwan
should follow their lead.</P>
      <P>Citing Haiti's recent upheaval caused by food shortages, Siew noted global food
prices have increased by 80 percent in recent years and said the price hikes
could worsen inflation and perhaps lead to political unrest and war.</P>
      <P>"But crude oil prices surging over US$100 per barrel this year has actually
opened up a different way of thinking that agriculture products could be used to
produce energy," Siew said.</P>
      <P>The vice president's comments seemed to contradict the stance of the incoming
head of the Council of Agriculture Chen Wu-hsiung, who said it would be
unfeasible to develop fallow lands to produce biofuels because of a lack of
economies of scale and high costs.</P>
      <P>He indicated, for example, that it cost at least NT$51 (US$1.70) to produce one
liter of biofuel from soya in Taiwan, which is much more expensive than abroad.</P>
      <P>The vice president-elect acknowledged at the forum that the development of crops
to be used as energy was not without problems and could aggravate pollution, but
he said the government will balance the harm while finding effective ways to use
the land.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Academia Sinica has discovered ways to use the inedible parts of crops,
including rice, to produce bio-energy,  while genetically transforming  the
crops to resist pests to reduce pesticide use, Siew said.</P>
      <P>"The incoming administration will keep encouraging this kind of research." Siew
vowed.</P>

      <P>The media environment in Taiwan is the freest in East Asia and 32nd freest
worldwide, according to an annual report released Tuesday by the U.S.-based
Freedom House.</P>
      <P>The report  attributed  Taiwan's  good performance  to the government's
commitment to judicial independence, economic freedom and a highly competitive
media market.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese media are vigorous and lively, regularly criticizing government
policy and top officials, " the report noted, adding that physical violence
against journalists is rare and both local and foreign reporters are able to
cover news freely.</P>
      <P>The Freedom of the Press 2008 report, which rated 195 countries and territories
worldwide, covered events that took place between Jan. 1, 2007 and Dec. 31,
2007.</P>
      <P>Countries were given a total score from 0 to 100, with the lower the score the
better the performance, based on a set of 23 methodology  questions divided into
three subcategories:  legal environment, political environment and economic
environment.</P>
      <P>Countries scoring 0-30 are regarded as having "free" media, those scoring 31-60
are considered as having "partly free" media, and those scoring 61-100 are
viewed as having "not free" media.</P>
      <P>Taiwan got a total score of 20, with 7 for legal environment, 7 for political
environment, and 6 for economic environment, making it the country with the 32nd
highest level of press freedom around the world.</P>
      <P>Of the 195 countries and territories rated, 72, or 37 percent, were grouped as
free; 59, or 30 percent, were classified as partly free; and 64, or 33 percent,
were categorized as not free.</P>
      <P>By region, Western Europe continued to boast the highest level of press freedom
worldwide, with 24 out of the total of 25 countries rated in the region regarded
as free for 2007. Turkey was the only country ranked as partly free in the
region.</P>
      <P>The Middle East and North Africa continued to be the worst regional performer,
with 15 out of the total of 19 countries rated classified as not free and three
grouped as partly free. Israel was the only country that got a free rating in
the region.</P>
      <P>Of the 40 countries and territories rated in the Asia-Pacific region, 16 were
categorized as free, 10 partly free, and 14 not free. North Korea and Myanmar
were ranked as having the lowest and second lowest level of press freedom in the
world.</P>
      <P>China was also given a not-free rating, with the level of the country's press
freedom ranking 181st worldwide.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dozens of Tibetans in Taiwan and supporters of Tibet's autonomy staged a
demonstration outside the Japanese representative office in Taipei Wednesday to
protest the arrest in Japan of Tashi Tsering, an exiled Tibetan holding a
Republic of China passport.</P>
      <P>Tashi, also vice chairman of the Taiwan chapter of the Tibetan Youth Congress,
was detained incommunicado for 48 hours after being charged with "forcible
obstruction of business" for his attempt to approach the Olympic torch during
the torch relay in Nagano in central Japan last Saturday.</P>
      <P>After the 48-hour  detention  period was over,  Tashi was interrogated by a
prosecutor, who decided to extend his detention for another 10 days.</P>
      <P>Noting that Japan is a democratic country where people enjoy freedom, Own Su-
jei, general secretary of the Taipei Tibetan Exchange Foundation (TTEF) , said
the "right to freely express one's opinion should be highly respected there."</P>
      <P>Own said that Tashi did not threaten to forcibly remove or harm the Olympic
torch, stressing that "what Tashi Tsering did in Japan was peaceful and non-
violent.</P>
      <P>"He merely approached the torch and shouted what he believes in -- 'free Tibet'.
"</P>
      <P>To make their stance known to Japanese  authorities,  the organizers of the
protest issued a petition, which was addressed to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of Japan, the Ministry of Justice, and the police authorities of Nagano.</P>
      <P>In the petition, the demonstrators asked the Japanese government to follow all
required legal procedures when dealing with the case and to provide Tashi with
an interpreter.</P>
      <P>"Tashi should be represented by an attorney to allow him to fully understand the
Japanese legal procedures that he faces, " the petition said.</P>
      <P>"He should be granted the right to have visitors as soon as possible, " Own
said. "It is unreasonable to put Tashi Tsering in detention with no visitors
allowed for 12 days.</P>
      <P>"We hereby urge the Japanese government to stand firm behind human rights
values, and not to bow to political pressure from China," he added.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Office Interchange Association (Japan) assigned a division chief,
identified  only as Kyoji,  to receive three representatives of the group and
allow them into the compound.</P>
      <P>"This will seriously affect the international image of Japan on human rights,"
Own said to Kyoji while handing him the petition.</P>
      <P>The organizers of the protest were the Taiwan Friends of Tibet, the Tibet Youth
Congress -- Taiwan Chapter, the Taiwan Tibetan Welfare Association, the TTEF,
the Taiwan Association for Human Rights,  the Taiwan Labor Front, and the Taiwan
International Solidarity Center.</P>

      <P>Computex Taipei 2008, the largest computer trade show in Asia and the second
largest in the world, will open in June with more than 35,000 overseas buyers
and is expected to generate US$20 billion in business, organizers said Wednesday
at a press conference.</P>
      <P>"Computex Taipei always tries to outperform itself, and that progress will come
together this year in a new phase for trade events, " said Walter Yeh, executive
vice president of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>"This year's Computex Taipei will be the biggest one ever in terms of the
numbers of participating companies and the exhibition space,"he said.</P>
      <P>The show will be based at the Taipei World Trade Center (TWTC) Nangang
Exhibition Hall, which just opened in mid-March and is located 20 minutes away
from the show's four other venues in the Xinyi District.</P>
      <P>It not only doubles as a space for exhibitors but also makes available many
state-of-the-art facilities, Yeh said, a good match, he noted, for such an
influential trade show.</P>
      <P>"Computex Taipei is the most important procurement platform in the world because
it is a business-to-business (B2B) trade show and a one-stop shopping center, "
Yeh said. "Buyers from all over the world can buy the latest and most advanced
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) products."</P>
      <P>The show, to be held from June 3 to June 7,  will see record-breaking growth
this year, with a 25.66 percent increase in exhibitors and and a 53.14 percent
rise in the number of booths.</P>
      <P>The exhibition's 1,675 vendors occupying around 4,481 booths will display
products in a variety of categories, including optoelectronic displays,
communication devices, components and parts, and brand new, purpose-designated
devices, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>"I would like to use the word 'WING' to describe this year's Computex Taipei, "
said Chang Li, deputy secretary-general of the Taipei Computer Association's
(TCA's) overseas division.</P>
      <P>He said "WING, " which stands for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave
Access (WiMAX) , ICT cross over, new-generation personal computers, and "green
IT, " will help propel the trade show to new heights.</P>
      <P>Chang said TAITRA and TCA, the organizers of Computex Taipei, will hold the 2008
WiMAX Expo Taipei concurrently with Computex to show the strength of Taiwan's
WiMAX industry and create business opportunities,  as WiMAX is an emerging
technology growing in popularity around the world.</P>
      <P>"The next three to five years will be critical for the growth and expansion of
WiMAX applications," he said.</P>
      <P>Providing excellent service to accommodate domestic and overseas visitors
during the fair will be another main task for the organizers, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>They will set up a reception center at the airport and arrange free
transportation connecting different venues, he said, adding that shuttle bus
service will also be running among exhibition centers every five to ten minutes.</P>
      <P>There will also be well-designed TAITRA lounges, free wireless Internet service,
three press centers, and procurement meetings, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Computex Taipei is the most important procurement platform in the
world, Yeh estimated there trade show will generate US$20 billion in new
business during the exhibition and create US$50-60 billion in follow-up
business.</P>

      <P>American Institute in Taiwan Director Stephen Young said Tuesday that the United
States hopes to cooperate with the incoming administration of President-elect Ma
Ying-jeou on all important issues.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the American Chamber of Commerce's annual "Hsieh Nien Fan" dinner,
Young said Taiwan is the United States' ninth largest trading partner, with U.S.
exports to Taiwan exceeding US$3.2 billion in 2007.</P>
      <P>The AIT head said that talks under the Trade and Investment Framework (TIFA) are
the most effective channel for strengthening trade relations between Taiwan and
the United States.</P>
      <P>Young said he expects efforts to expand the opening of each other's markets and
increase investment opportunities will continue under the TIFA talks slated to
be held in Taipei this summer.</P>
      <P>He specifically expressed the hope that Taiwan will lift its ban and allow the
import of all categories of U.S. beef products as well as sign an agreement  on
pork imports that is in line with international standards and established
practices.</P>
      <P>As for China-Taiwan relations, Young said that the United States supports closer
cross-strait economic ties.</P>
      <P>He commended the meeting between Vice President-elect Vincent Siew and Chinese
President Hu Jintao at the Boao Forum for Asia held earlier this month on Hainan
Island, China, calling it symbolically significant in terms of improving cross-
strait ties.</P>
      <P>Young also expressed the hope that regular direct cross-strait charter flights
could be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is very important and should not be neglected by the
international community, Young said that the United States will do all that it
can to let the world understand the many significant contributions that Taiwan
can make to the international community.</P>
      <P>He also promised that the United States will work to ensure that Taiwan can
engage in "meaningful participation" in international organizations and
activities, including organizations in which Taiwan does not meet the
requirements for membership.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan was rated the world's fourth largest sovereign wealth generator for 2007,
with approximately US$184 billion,  according  to a report released recently  by
international economic and financial information company Global Insight.</P>
      <P>The Sovereign Wealth Fund Tracker report noted that Taiwan's sovereign wealth,
calculated by deducting three months of import spending from a country's foreign
exchange reserves, has been expanding at a rate of 4 percent per year on
average, up from US$156 billion in 2003.</P>
      <P>China remained the largest player, with the country's sovereign wealth having
grown by 47 percent annually from US$259 billion in 2003 to US$1.2 trillion in
2007.</P>
      <P>Rounding out the top 10 list were Russia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Brazil, India, South
Korea, Algeria, Liberia and Nigeria, in that order.</P>
      <P>The report said oil exporters have been the fastest-growing sovereign wealth
generators over the last five years, with the sovereign wealth of Nigeria having
increased by 291 percent.</P>
      <P>Sovereign wealth has grown in Oman by 256 percent, in Kazakhstan by 162 percent,
in Angola by 84 percent, in Russia by 74 percent and in Brazil by 65 percent.</P>
      <P>This newfound wealth has sparked the growth of sovereign wealth funds --
government-controlled funds that invest in stocks, bonds, and commodities around
the world -- that many critics believe are not transparent enough and are used
by governments to project their influence rather than to maximize value for
their citizens.</P>
      <P>The report said that sovereign wealth funds worldwide have been increasing by 24
percent annually for the past three years to reach US$3.5 trillion in 2007.</P>
      <P>According to the report, in 2007, sovereign wealth funds injected up to US$80
billion into bank shares or bank equity stakes in the United States alone and
are expected to provide even more capital in 2008 and 2009.</P>
      <P>Jan Randolph, head of sovereign risk at Global Insight, observed sovereign

    <HEADLINE>45 percent of Taiwan voters favor cross-strait status quo: poll</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 45 percent of the respondents to a recent survey favor the maintenance of
the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, according to the results of the poll
conducted by the Global Views Monthly magazine and released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The results of the poll, conducted April 15-18, show that some 45 percent of
Taiwan citizens aged over 20 favor the notion that "the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait should maintain the political status quo for the time being before any
changes are made."</P>
      <P>The percentage marks the highest of its kind in the last five years, according
to the pollsters.</P>
      <P>In the poll that the pollsters claimed could be considered a "score sheet" for
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou and the incoming Kuomintang (KMT) administration --
despite the fact that it is one month before the administration is even
inaugurated -- some 60 percent of the respondents  said they are pleased  with
Ma's performance in the run-up to his inauguration, compared with 17 percent who
said they are not.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two percent of the other respondents offered no clear answer to the
question, indicating that there is still a group of people who waiting to see
what Ma's administration actually does, according to the pollsters.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 49 percent of the respondents consider Ma's appointment of
Soochow University President Liu Chao-shiuan as premier-designate as
"appropriate, " compared to 11 percent who disagree.</P>
      <P>The respondents, however, were apparently dissatisfied with the performance of
the legislature, where the KMT holds an absolute majority of 70 percent of the
113 seats.</P>
      <P>Thirty-nine  percent of the respondents said they are not satisfied with the
performances of the KMT lawmakers, while 38 percent said they are satisfied,
according to the poll.</P>
      <P>On the opening policies that Ma has announced toward China, the policy of
allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan won the highest support  rating from
those polled,  with 76.8 percent of the respondents expressing approval,
followed by 69 percent who approved of the policy of starting weekend cross-
strait charter flight services.</P>
      <P>Sixty-six percent of the respondents expressed support for the opening of cross-
strait cargo flight services and 61 percent said they support the opening of the
official exchanges between the new Taiwan dollar and the Chinese yuan.</P>
      <P>Many of the respondents said they support Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists,
with those from the northern city of Keelung to the northeastern county of Yilan
and the eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung -- areas with particularly rich
tourism resources -- showing the highest support rate of 80 percent, the poll
found.</P>
      <P>Of all the notions that could contribute to a thawing of the long-stalled cross-
strait relations, the respondents gave the lowest support rate to the notion of
Taiwan opening its real estate sector to Chinese buyers.</P>
      <P>Only 37 percent of the respondents support the notion, while 63 percent oppose
it, the poll found.</P>
      <P>The respondents  expressed  concern that ordinary Taiwanese residents might not
benefit from soaring house prices after Chinese tycoons speculate on the real
estate market, the pollsters said.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that although Ma won the March 22 race by winning nearly 58
percent of the vote, with the pro-independence ruling Democratic Progressive
Party suffering a crushing defeat, the map of ideological division in Taiwan
remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>The poll found that the percentage of respondents who favor eventual unification
dropped to a record low of 8.4 percent.</P>
      <P>A total of 44.8 percent of the respondents favor the idea that "the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait should maintain the political status quo for the time being
before any changes are made in the future," the highest percentage of its kind
in five years.</P>
      <P>The figures indicate that the Taiwanese public are no longer concerned about the
issue of independence or unification, the pollsters said.</P>
      <P>The Global Views Monthly conducted the survey by telephone among adults randomly
selected from 23 cities and counties around the country. It received 1,003 valid
responses, with a margin of error of 3.1 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The spokesman of President-elect Ma Ying-jeou's office reaffirmed Wednesday in
an effort to calm the strong opposition to the nomination of Lai Shin-yuan as
chairwoman of the Mainland Affair Council that Ma's stance on cross-Taiwan
Strait policies will not change and that he hopes the public will give Lai time
to act.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-chiang made the remarks in the wake of the controversial designation of
Lai, a former legislator of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
who is regarded by critics as lacking the experience necessary to deal with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lai's appointment has been the target of criticism from nearly all fronts, with
even the ruling Democratic Progressive Party casting doubt over the rationale
behind the nomination, while political pundits have ridiculed Ma's decision on
TV talk shows around the clock.</P>
      <P>Discounting media reports that Lai's appointment will have a negative impact on
cross-strait relations, Lo described all the reports as "presumptive."</P>
      <P>Ma's stance on developing and dealing with cross-strait issues will never
change, Lou said, adding that "it is usual" that some appointments will arouse
divergent responses.</P>
      <P>"Ma will take opinions from all sides into consideration, " he added.</P>
      <P>Some of Ma's long-time friends also came to his aid. Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin
of the Kuomintang (KMT) expressed support for Ma's decision, saying that "I
respect the legitimate authority of Ma and Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan to
assign personnel."</P>
      <P>"We should believe in Ma, since there must be some strategic considerations
behind the appointment... and Ma must be confident in implementing his
policies," Hau added.</P>
      <P>But Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei, also of the KMT, said Ma should not be
influenced by the TSU when dealing with cross-strait policies, as "he has
already been elected president."</P>
      <P>Chou further said that "Ma has won the support of more than 7 million voters,
empowering him to decide cross-strait policies, " adding that "Ma should not
seek compromise with the TSU."</P>
      <P>Lai holds a master's degree in international relations and a doctorate in
development studies, both earned in the United Kingdom. She has served as
Taiwan's negotiator for World Trade Organization accession, as a member of the
National Security Council, a legislator and a university research fellow.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei city government's Department of Health said Tuesday that it will
conduct noise level tests at an emergency helicopter pad located next to Taipei
City Hospital's Zhongxing branch.</P>
      <P>Chiu Wen-hsiang, chief of the department, made the remarks at a city government
interpellation session in response to questions raised by City Councilor Lee
Wen-Ying about the noise situation in the vicinity of the helipad.</P>
      <P>Lee relayed the complaints -- made to her by several parents of students at
Taipei Municipal Zhongxiao Junior High School, which is located near the
helipad.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the parents have complained that the noise of helicopters
landing and taking off from the pad is disrupting classes at the school and that
the frequency of the landings and take-offs has been on the rise in recent
months.</P>
      <P>Liu Hsiou-wen, head of the Zhongxing branch, said the helipad was built in late
2005 to improve the quality of emergency medical services on Taiwan's outlying
islands.</P>
      <P>He said that although the average number of helicopter landings and takeoffs has
increased from around 20 in the first year to approximately 30 at present, the
hospital has not received any noise complaints from students or faculty at the
school, or from residents in the surrounding neighborhood.</P>
      <P>While relaying the complaints from the students' parents, Lee suggested that the
city's health department  and environmental protection department carry out
noise level tests at the site and perhaps install soundproof windows at the
school or sound barrier walls -- such as those used to shield noise from
freeways and expressways -- between the school and the helipad.</P>
      <P>In response, Chiou said that the department will conduct tests at the site and
that if it is determined that the noise levels exceed acceptable levels, the
department will take appropriate steps to improve the situation.</P>

      <P>Chinese spouses in Taiwan should be treated the same as foreign spouses from
other countries, the minister-designate in charge of the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Jennifer J. H. Wang said it is unfair that Chinese spouses are treated
differently from other foreign spouses in Taiwan, and vowed that, if possible,
she would work to allow Chinese spouses the same rights and benefits enjoyed by
foreign nationals from other countries who are married to Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>Wang, nevertheless, pointed out that whether or not her plans could be realized
will be up to the Mainland Affairs Council, the country's top China policy
planning agency.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while addressing a seminar that focused on the rights of
working class and disadvantaged laborers in Taiwan, which was sponsored by the
Taipei-based Chinese Association for Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Among other regulations, the government stipulates that Chinese spouses of
Taiwanese citizens must reside in Taiwan for a minimum of three years before
they can apply for a work permit. In contrast, foreign spouses from other
countries are permitted to apply for a work permit as soon as they obtain their
residency in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To redress the situation, intense education and publicity is needed, and the CLA
also has to do its part, Wang said.</P>
      <P>She suggested that local governments make an effort to educate employers and
employees about laborers' rights and interests, while the CLA should upgrade its
official Web site so that workers, regardless of whether they are from China or
elsewhere, would have easier and better access to the country's top labor
affairs agency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislators oppose health insurance rate hike</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
04/30/08  18:03:13
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators opposed almost unanimously Wednesday a request to raise insurance
premiums by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) , which warned of a
deficit of more than NT$20 billion this year should the rate be maintained at
the current level.</P>
      <P>Precise calculations conducted by the BNHI show that in the next five years, the
income from insurance premiums will record a growth of 2.21 percent per year on
average, while medical expenses will increase in the same period by 3.13 percent
and the total costs will spike by 4.11 percent.</P>
      <P>"If we maintain the current insurance rate of 4.55 percent, an average annual
deficit of NT$40.3 billion will occur in the coming five years, " said BNHI
President Zhu Zer-min, predicting that in 2012, the total accumulated deficit
will have reached NT$214.2 billion.</P>
      <P>To avoid plunging the entire system into a financial abyss, he suggested that
premiums be raised to 5.18 percent in order to balance the costs and revenues
over five years and that the insured should be required to pay 20 percent of the
cost of diagnosis and emergency treatment fees.</P>
      <P>However, the legislators firmly opposed raising the premiums, saying that the
bureau should cover the loopholes in the insurance system, such as a price gap
between drugs and illegal practices by doctors, and should take into
consideration health insurance reforms before asking people to pay more.</P>
      <P>The price gap is the difference  between the amount that healthcare providers --
hospitals -- pays for drugs and the amount that the BNHI reimburses the
hospitals.</P>
      <P>According to Legislator Lin Hung-chih, the BNHI reimburses some healthcare
providers for the price of patent drugs even though the hospital prescribes
cheaper generic ones.</P>
      <P>"Since President-elect Ma Ying-jeou has promised to increase the economic growth
rate to 6 percent, more budget should be appropriated to fill the deficit, "
said Hwang Yih-jiau, an opposition Kuomintang legislator.</P>
      <P>Legislators also said health insurance reforms could be a solution to the
deficit problem.</P>
      <P>According  to  the  health  insurance  reforms,  dubbed "second-generation
health insurance, " insurance premiums are charged in accordance with household
income, instead of according to six categories based on professions.</P>
      <P>Premiums have only been raised once -- from 4.25 percent to 4.55 percent in 2002
-- since the system was put into effect in 1995.</P>

      <P>President-elect Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that once his new administration is
inaugurated, he will make sure capital and funds that have been diverted out of
the country over the past five years are attracted back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a group of representatives from the industrial and business sectors
in northern Taiwan at a roundtable meeting, Ma said that "opening and
deregulation" will be the main guiding motto of the incoming administration.</P>
      <P>Noting that strict regulations have caused capital flight over the past several
years and that local funds never return once they leave, Ma said an Asia-Pacific
assets management center and fund operational hub will be established before
long to "recoup the lost funds."</P>
      <P>He also said taxes will be reduced and regulations simplified so that businesses
can offer more jobs and better jobs with higher pay.</P>
      <P>Ma said various policies will be launched immediately after his May 20
inauguration. "Although we have won the presidential election, what is more
important is making sure our campaign platform is delivered into policies that
will benefit the people," he said.</P>
      <P>Vice President-elect  Vincent  Siew,  a veteran  technocrat particularly versed

    <TEXT>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond Burghardt said Tuesday at a
symposium that he is optimistic about the development of cross-strait relations
after Taiwan's President-elect Ma Ying-jeou takes office, and asked Beijing to
take a "more flexible and imaginative approach" so that the relations could move
forward.</P>
      <P>"After May 20 -- Ma's inauguration -- we enter a period in which we will have
the right to have some optimism," said Burghardt, who also serves as director of
the East-West Seminars at the East-West Center (EWC), a Hawaii-based education
and research institution.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a Taiwan Election Symposium, co-hosted by the Pacific
Forum under the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and the
Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) Tuesday in Honolulu. The seminar
examined the implications of Taiwan's recent presidential and parliamentary
elections.</P>
      <P>Burghardt said that there is an opportunity to reduce tensions across the Taiwan
Strait, but that stability will require engagement, which had not been much in
evidence over the last 10 years.</P>
      <P>"Success will depend on China's decision to take a more flexible and imaginative
approach to Taiwan," said the head of the AIT, the quasi-official organization
that handles Taiwan-U.S. affairs in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>"Beijing  must  go from crisis  management  to opportunity management," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma's landslide victory on March 22 and an even more lopsided victory by the
Kuomintang (KMT) candidates in the January Legislative Yuan elections will allow
the KMT to dominate both branches of government in Taipei and herald the return
of a conservative government in Taiwan after the KMT lost power to the
Democratic Progressive Party in 2000.</P>
      <P>Experts and next generation analysts at the forum agreed that Ma's election as
president of Taiwan "opens the door to a new and positive cross-strait dynamic
between Taipei and Beijing, but the chances of a breakthrough are limited, "
according to a press release issued by the symposium.</P>
      <P>"Both sides are waiting for a positive gesture from the other to move forward,"
according to Ralph Cossa, president of the Pacific Forum CSIS.</P>
      <P>He argued that the biggest problem for China is that it knows how to deal with
an unfriendly government in Taipei, but a friendly government forces it to adopt
an entirely new mindset.</P>
      <P>"I'm not sure Beijing knows how to handle this situation. The most challenging
issue for Beijing is how to show respect for Taiwan without making reunification
less likely," Cossa said.</P>
      <P>Pacific forum Adjunct Fellow Richard Halloran, a freelance journalist and
longtime Asia watcher, also warned against inflated expectations.</P>
      <P>"There are opportunities, but there remain profound differences between the two.
The fundamentals really haven't changed, " Halloran said. He agreed with the
other speakers that the primary responsibility for moving the cross-strait
relationship forward lies with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Shashan Wang, who is from China and a Vasey Fellow at the Pacific Forum CSIS,
provided a next-generation perspective on the election and cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Describing the elections as "an invigorating phenomenon," Wang said that young
people on the mainland see Taiwan's politics as a sign of possible
opportunities.</P>
      <P>She also urged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to open more channels of
communication so that they could better understand each other and to move beyond
the misperceptions that color cross-strait relations, a suggestion approved by
all on the podium.</P>
      <P>The panelists called on officials both in Taipei and Beijing to seize the
opportunity to establish better relations between Taiwan and the People's
Republic of China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) legislators, skeptical over the designation of a pro-
independence former lawmaker as head of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) in the incoming KMT government, urged the appointee to reject the
offer to allay grave public concerns about her appointment.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chiu Yi, while answering questions from reporters at the
Legislative Yuan, said the appointment of former Taiwan Solidarity Union
lawmaker Lai Hsing-yuan to the key post has stirred up discontent among Taiwan
businessmen in China.</P>
      <P>"President-elect  Ma Ying-jeou has showed poor judgment in appointing Lai as MAC
chief -- something which is very likely to spoil the planned negotiations
between the two sides," Chiu argued.</P>
      <P>"Lai must resign from the post if Ma's election promises -- establishing direct
weekend charter flights across the Taiwan Strait and allowing Chinese tourists
to visit Taiwan -- fail to be implemented on time on July 4," he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he predicted that Lai's appointment is likely to create disputes
between the MAC and the semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation (SFF) under its
oversight over Taiwan's dealings with China.</P>
      <P>"It would be a great disaster if such a development occurs," Chiu warned.</P>
      <P>In a legislative committee meeting, KMT Legislator Lee Chia-chin suggested Ma
replace Lai, the sooner the better, to avoid possible negative consequences.</P>
      <P>"Lai's designation as MAC chief is by no means a trivial matter,' he said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, some Taiwan businessmen in China are very upset about Lai's
appointment and might refuse to attend Ma's inaugural ceremony on May 20.</P>
      <P>Lee also urged Lai to show up quickly and clarify her stance to KMT lawmakers.</P>
      <P>For her part, KMT lawmaker Hsu Shao-ping urged Ma to heed the sentiments of the
more than 7.65 million people who voted for him in the March 22 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>"It would be the best damage control measure for all parties concerned  if Lai
takes  the initiative  and turns  down the appointment," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference held at the KMT's caucus office at the Legislative
Yuan, the party's acting caucus whip Hsieh Kuo-liang said the caucus supports
Ma's appointment of Lai as MAC chairwoman, but he also asked Lai to explain
further, to caucus members, her position in terms of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Lai had better do so quickly in order to bring an early end to the dispute, "
Hsieh said, suggesting that Lai need not wait until next week to make the move
at a planned lunch meeting with Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan and other
Cabinet appointees at the KMT headquarters.</P>
      <P>The party's legislative caucus members will ask Lai to delve deeper into her
stance on issues concerning Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists and the
establishment of cross-strait weekend charter flights on July 4, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, however, also asked the public to give Lai more time to prove whether she
will follow Ma's cross-strait policy direction.</P>
      <P>Ma said Tuesday that he still aims to make the direct weekend charter flights
and the entry of Chinese tourists a reality on July 4 as projected.</P>

to exchange ideas on the subject of electronic commerce.</P>
      <P>Mikitani met with Ma and Minister-designate of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming
at the Taipei headquarters of the soon-to-be-ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>After the 30-minute meeting, Mikitani said in response to media inquiries that
he and Ma had discussed how to help medium- and small-sized enterprises to
promote their products by means of e-commerce.</P>
      <P>He also said that his company is working with President Chain Store Corp.,
Taiwan's biggest convenience chain store operator, on a business venture to
launch a Rakuten Ichiba online shopping mall in Taiwan in May.</P>
      <P>The new business will combine Rakuten's existing online marketing and

      <P>Most parts of Taiwan will see showers or thundershowers for seven days from May
1, as a moist air mass, brought by southwesterly winds, moves across the Taiwan
area, the Central Weather Bureau forecast Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CWB meteorologists said that from May 1-4, except for southern Taiwan, all other
areas, including the outlying islands of Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, will have
rain, followed by thunderstorms from May 5-6, with southeastern Taiwan
experiencing only showers, the CWB said.</P>
      <P>Temperatures over the next seven days will vary between 20-27 degrees Celsius in
northern Taiwan, 21-29 degrees Celsius in central Taiwan, 23-31 degrees Celsius
in southern Taiwan, and 21-28 degrees Celsius in eastern Taiwan, according to
the weather bureau.</P>
      <P>The weather experts explained that the approaching front does not mean that the
annual plum rain season is beginning early this year. They added that plum rain
fronts usually occur after mid-May.</P>
      <P>The plum rain season is so named because it coincides with the ripening of the
fruit. Formed when moist air over the Pacific meets cooler continental air
masses, the plum rains often last in East Asian countries until mid-summer.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economic growth rate for the first quarter of 2008 is estimated at 5.13
percent as the government continues working toward the goal of achieving 4.8
percent growth for the whole year, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The country's unemployment rate stood at 3.8 percent for the first quarter,
showing a leveling off compared with the same quarter of last year, when the
unemployment rate registered 3.9 percent, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during a weekly Cabinet meeting in which he was
briefed on the country's economic situation for the first quarter.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the performance of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration over the past eight years has often been underrated because of
election or political rivalries, Chang said it is time for the public to look at
the issue objectively now that the presidential election is over.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that under the DPP's leadership, Taiwan's economic growth
averaged 4.1 percent between 2000 and 2007, which was higher than the global
average of 3.2 percent for the same period.</P>
      <P>With a total of 910,000 jobs created over the last eight years, the country's
unemployment rate dropped to 3.91 percent for 2007, the lowest level in the past
seven years, he went on.</P>
      <P>By the end of 2007, Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves had increased to US$270.3
billion, 1.5 times as much as the US$106.2 billion recorded at the end of 1999
when the Kuomintang (KMT) was last in power, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the volume of foreign trade was doubled from US$232.3 billion in 1999
to US$465.9 billion in 2007, he continued.</P>
      <P>Over the past eight years, he continued, the DPP administration has helped
domestic banking institutions  write off bad debts amounting  to nearly  NT$2
trillion,  lowering  their  average non-performing loan ratio from a high of
11.76 percent to 1.79 percent.</P>
      <P>In terms of the promotion of social welfare, Chang said the DPP administration
has funneled an average of NT$290.9 billion per year into programs in this
regard over the past eight years, compared with an average of NT$166 billion per
year that was spent by the former KMT administration.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a NT$3,000 monthly allowance for the elderly by the DPP
administration has benefited 950,000 senior citizens, while an increase in the
monthly allowance for elderly farmers from NT$3,000 to NT$6,000 has benefited
733,000 people, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the national pension program set to be launched in October is
expected to cover 3.53 million people, while the new retirement program
introduced during the DPP administration has benefited 6.44 million workers, he
said, adding that 1.41 million workers have also benefited from a raising of the
minimum wage.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is projected to capture 60 percent of the world's market for expensive
bicycles by 2012, a 240 percent expansion within a five-year period, said the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At present Taiwan possessed about 25 percent of the global market for high-end
bikes, selling 2.5 million of the 5.3 million total units exported worldwide,
said Tseng Farn-hann, a senior official of the MOEA's Industrial Development
Bureau (IDB).</P>
      <P>"By 2012, we plan to capture 60 percent of the market by boosting all of our
bike makers into high-end ones,Tseng noted.</P>
      <P>At the beginning the 21th century, Taiwan's bicycle manufacturers have either
moved operations to China or shut down due to competition from the mainland in
the low-end bicycle market.</P>
      <P>To survive, Taiwanese bike manufacturers have steadily switched to making
upscale bikes, which cost around US$250 or more.</P>
      <P>This has helped upgrade Taiwan's once-ailing bicycle industry.</P>
      <P>The industry has also launched A-Team, a non-profit organization made up of 11
local bike makers, to incorporate advanced car making technology into the
manufacturing process.</P>
      <P>The achievement of such industry innovations became apparent as Taiwan's bike
industry exports reached over US$1.05 billion in value in 2007, a huge jump from
the US$580 million in 2003. The exports came from the 11 A-Team members.</P>
      <P>With innovation and technology, the prices of Taiwanese bikes exported also rose
in price from US$100 per unit in 2002 to US$222 per export unit.</P>
      <P>Combining  local  bike  making  experience  and high-tech manufacturing
capacity, the IDB has promoted better production management of bike makers to
make high-quality products,said Tseng.</P>
      <P>He added the next aspects to work on include streamlining the logistics of
makers and promoting further research, which should focus on finding nitch
market, designing new products, improving the quality of materials used, and
developing more diverse functions, such as the wide application of anti-shock
cushions.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's genetic modification technology used to enhance ethanol refining is
mature and will be able to produce enough biomass energy to cope with the energy
crisis, researchers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As the world is facing both a food and an energy crisis, Taiwanese researchers
have been developing technology for genetically modifying plants such as rice
and sugar cane in order to reduce growing time and increase the portion
available for refining into ethanol, the researchers said.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan has advanced technology, farmers and experts, Taiwan can secure a
place in the biomass market, which will be an important powerhouse driving
economic growth, Winston Wong, chairman of the board of the Grace T.H.W. Group,
said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>According to the organizers, only three countries in the world -- Brazil, Sweden
and Thailand -- use significant amounts of biofuel as an alternative energy
source.</P>
      <P>The press conference included a bit of theatrics to show the power generated by
ethanol in which a magician made a table float in midair using small box of
biofuel.</P>
      <P>Asked if the principal costs of biomass development are too high, Yu Su-may, a
researcher of the Institute of Molecular Biology at Academia Sinica -- Taiwan's
top academic institution -- said they are using low-cost plants, fibrous plants,
rice straw and sugarcane waste in order to keep costs down. By doing so, biomass
development will not overshadow the need for food production, said Yu.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture said last week that its attempts to plant biomass
energy plants such as corn, soybeans and sunflowers have failed due to the high
principal cost and that it plans to switch to agricultural waste and fibrous
plants to produce biomass energy.</P>

      <P>The total production value of Taiwan companies rose by 47.8 percent to NT$24.19
trillion in 2006 compared with 2001, but the growth of the average annual wage
slowed to 7.1 percent over the same period, the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The official assessment of Taiwan's manufacturing and service sectors, held once
every five years, compared the statistics for 2006 with the figures for 2001.</P>
      <P>"Despite the exodus of local manufacturers in the past decade, data shows a
revival of Taiwan's industry productivity, especially in manufacturing where
production value increased from 2001 by 60 percent to NT$15.55 trillion in 2007,
" said Huang Jiann-jong, deputy director of the Bureau of Census under the
DGBAS.</P>
      <P>He attributed the strong performance to the soaring output of semiconductor and
optics makers, which together accounted for production value of NT1.5 trillion
in 2006.</P>
      <P>Employment in the manufacturing sector also rose by 12.9 percent to 7.52 million
employees in 2006, as a result of an 18.2 percent increase in the number of
Taiwan companies to 1.1 million, Huang added.</P>
      <P>However, the strong showing in the manufacturing sector was overshadowed by the
slow growth of the average annual wage, which reached NT$538,658 in 2006, up by
a meager 7.1 percent in the five-year period compared with the 15.3 percent rise
in the period 1996 to 2000, he said.</P>
      <P>"In face of globalization, Taiwan's wage standard was undercut by lower
corporate profitability, " Huang explained. Privatization of many state-owned
companies was another contributing factor to the slow average wage growth, he
added.</P>
      <P>The production value from the service sector accounted for only 29.8 percent
growth, rising to NT$8.63 trillion in 2006, a relatively weak performance
against the NT$15.55 trillion made in manufacturing, he said.</P>
      <P>Touching  on  the  trend  of heavy  reliance  on overseas Taiwan-owned
factories, Huang said 47.9 percent of the production value of high-tech
manufacturers in 2006 was recorded overseas, up 33 percent from 2001. The
production value of traditional manufacturers relied 3.9 percent on overseas
factories, he added.</P>
      <P>Local traditional manufacturers, which include metals and mechanics,
petrochemicals, and the commodity industry, were in good heath, showing
production value in 2006 of NT$8.9 trillion, accounting for 64 percent of the
overall production value of manufacturers, Huang noted.</P>

      <P>The National Police Agency (NPA) will launch a four-month program from May 1 to
ask policemen nationwide to carry out effective measures in line with the
central government's carbon emissions reduction plan, the agency said Wednesday
in a press release.</P>
      <P>According to the NPA statement, it is encouraging policemen to walk, take public
transportation, or cycle, instead of driving a car when they have to carry out
duties over a short distance. When they have to be on duty over a long distance,
they should share vehicles, it added.</P>
      <P>Policemen are also asked not to carry too much in the trucks of their cars and
to turn off their vehicle engines at stoplights, as part of the NPA's efforts to
help reduce gasoline consumption.</P>
      <P>The NPA said that the program will be implemented until the end of August in the
hope of encouraging police authorities to take the lead in the carbon reduction
efforts.</P>
      <P>In addition, policemen also are being asked to lose weight and to conserve
electricity in their use of computers, air conditioners, lights and elevators in
office, among other eco-friendly measures, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Citing information provided by the Environmental Protection Administration, the
NPA said the consumption of one liter of gasoline produces 2.34 kg of carbon
dioxide, while the use of one liter of diesel produces 2.78 kg of the greenhouse
gas.</P>
      <P>The NPA assured the public that despite its energy saving campaign, it will

      <P>The dispatch of a monitoring vessel to police Taiwanese vessels operating in the
Atlantic and Indian oceans signifies the government's determination to achieve
good management in deep-sea fishing, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Sha Chih-yi, deputy director of the Council of Agriculture's Fisheries
Administration, said the vessel was sent out April 22 on an annual 183-day
mission. This is the third consecutive year that the vessel, called Yushun No.
2, has been sent on the mission, Sha said.</P>
      <P>The vessel,  carrying fishery observers,  will monitor the movements and
operations of Taiwanese deep-sea fishing boats and maintain order in fishing
zones, Sha said.</P>
      <P>The action stemmed from a 2005 resolution by the International Commission for
the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) to cut Taiwan's bigeye tuna quota for
2006 from 14,900 tons to 4,600 tons in the Atlantic Ocean, which resulted in a
loss to Taiwan of NT$10 billion (US$32.89 million).</P>
      <P>Taiwan was also given an annual quota for bigeye tuna catch by the Indian Ocean
Tuna Commission, which was established under the United Nation's framework.</P>
      <P>Although the ICCAT quota was restored to 14,900 in 2007 because of Taiwan's
adherence to the commission's regulations, the Yushun No. 2 was dispatched to
show Taiwan's resolution to follow the rules set out by international
organizations and to display self discipline, Sha said.</P>
      <P>Since the ICCAT resolution in 2005, Taiwan has improved its management of deep-
sea fishing by deploying monitoring systems on fishing boats, establishing a
rapid reporting system and carrying out checks at foreign ports such as
Mauritius in the Indian Ocean and Cape Town in South Africa.</P>
      <P>The Yushun No. 2 is also carrying Coast Guard Administration officers to enhance
its ability to do its work, Sha said. The fishery observers and officers onboard
the monitoring ship have the right to board and inspect Taiwan's deep-sea
fishing boats, even as they protect the rights of such vessels on the high seas,
he added.</P>

      <P>The Business Weekly unveiled Wednesday a list of 131 medical doctors considered
by their peers to be the best in their fields, with National Taiwan University
(NTU) Hospital boasting the largest number on the list.</P>
      <P>The list was compiled based on the results of a survey among more than 4,000
attending physicians at regional or higher-level hospitals around the country, a
magazine spokesman said.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that the business weekly has published such a list for
its readers' reference, the spokesman said, adding that major local medical
associations and hospitals had assisted in distributing the questionnaires. The
attending physicians surveyed were in 11 different medical branches.</P>
      <P>In the survey, each respondent was asked to recommend a short list of three
medical doctors they would most likely recommend to their ailing friends or
relatives, based on professionalism and work attitude.</P>
      <P>More than 600 physicians and surgeons were recommended in the survey, with 131
of them gaining the most recommendations, the magazine  spokesman  said,  adding
that  their  major  common characteristics  include outstanding  professional
expertise or competence and kind-heartedness.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results, 73 percent of the 131 most recommended doctors
are working at hospitals in northern Taiwan; 14 percent are in central Taiwan
hospitals; 13 percent are in southern Taiwan hospitals; and only 0.8 percent are
in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The figures  show the inequity  of our medical  resource distribution," the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital in Taipei
City alone accounts for 30 of the 131 "most recommended" physicians, topping all
other hospitals.</P>
      <P>Veterans General Hospital in suburban Taipei came in second, with 26 "most
recommended" doctors.</P>
      <P>Among those recommended in pediatrics were Lee Ping-ying and Chang Mei-hui at
NTU Hospital and Huang Fu-yuan at Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lee Jen-chih,  director of Tzu Chi Hospital's tuberculosis laboratory in the
eastern county of Hualien, was also highly recommended for his professional
competence and concern for patients. He is known to visit his patients at their
homes to check whether they take their medicines in accordance with his
instructions.</P>
      <P>Also high on the list is Ho Shih-chu, director of the obsterics and gynecology
department at Taichung Veterans General Hospital in central Taiwan who has
traveled extensively throughout Taiwan's countryside to conduct smear tests for
rural women in a bid to prevent cervical cancer.</P>

3.9 percent was the lowest in the last seven years.</P>
      <P>Chang said taking good care of laborers, who are the bedrock of the country's
economic development, has always been the government's priority.</P>
      <P>At an Executive Yuan price stabilizing meeting held the same day, Chang asked
the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) to supervise a public project  for  local

Erwin Johnson picks up a clump of the dark, rich soil that he has farmed for 35
years, like his father and grandfather before him. In a few months, this flat
expanse of northern Iowa will be crowded with corn ready to be trucked to
market.

The Washington Times: Bush lays gas blame on Congress

President Bush blamed the Democratic Congress for blocking bills he said would
have lowered gas prices, marking a coordinated strategy with congressional
Republicans to shift responsibility for the nation's economic woes to Democrats.
They, in turn, were quick to strike back.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Taitung County sees poor plum harvest</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taitung County in eastern Taiwan saw only 20 percent of its usual plum harvest
this year due to unusual and unstable climate conditions during the fruit's
growth and ripening periods, a plum grower told the CNA Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Lee To-hai, who grows plums in Luanshan in the county's Yen-ping
Township, the area usually produces more than 150,000 kg of plums annually, but
this year's production was only 20,000 kg.</P>
      <P>What's even worse is that 20 percent of the crop was abnormally shaped plums
that cannot be sent to the market, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said last summer's dry weather had weakened the roots and trunks of the plum
trees, and because of the unstable weather in January this year, pollination of
the plants was interrupted, which caused the fruit to grow in abnormal shapes.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said that too much rainfall during the plums' ripening season in
March and April had caused the pulps to split.</P>
      <P>Lee said his hope was to at least recover the cost of picking the poor harvest
of plums.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC chair-designate promises to improve cross-strait relations</HEADLINE>

      <P>Lai Hsing-yuan, chairwoman-designate of the Mainland Affairs Council, promised
Wednesday that she will devote her efforts to the creation of better cross-
Taiwan Strait relations, emphasizing that her stance on China policies is in
line with President-elect Ma Ying Jeou's.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks after a meeting with Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman-
designate of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , which
handles engagements with China in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>It was also Lai's first public appearance since she was named as the incoming
head of the MAC by Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>The appointment of the former legislator of the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) has drawn criticisms by legislators of the soon-to-be-
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and many political commentators.</P>
      <P>Saying that her stance on cross-strait issues is based on Taiwan's integrity and
the interests of all the Taiwan people, Lai promised that she will do her best
to develop better cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>Discounting concerns that she does not share Ma's view that "there is only one
China, but with different interpretations, " Lai reaffirmed that she recognizes
the so-called 92-Consensus, implying that she shares Mas viewpoint on the issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that her previous contact with Chiang started in 1997 when they worked
together on APEC issues, Lai lauded Chiang as a respected patriarch and said she
believes that "the MAC and the SEF will cooperate well in the future."</P>
      <P>"The SEF is the organization authorized to deal with cross-strait affairs, while
the MAC will function as the coordinator of a diversity of views," Lai noted.</P>
      <P>Saying that he had very good experiences in working with Lai on aspects of
international negotiations, Chiang praised Lai at a briefing after their
45-minute closed-door meeting as "professional, hard-working, and tenacious."</P>
      <P>Chiang also said he was sure that "both the SEF and the MAC will cooperate well
and will be jointly responsible for implementing Ma's cross-strait policies."</P>
      <P>Lai holds a master's degree in international relations and a doctorate in
development studies, both earned in the United Kingdom. She has served as
Taiwan's negotiator for World Trade Organization accession, as a member of the
National Security Council, a legislator and a university research fellow.</P>
      <P>Lai's appointment has been the target of criticisms on nearly all fronts, with
even the ruling Democratic Progressive Part casting doubts over the rationale
behind her selection, while political pundits have ridiculed Mas decision on TV
talk shows around the clock.</P>
      <P>At the news briefing, Lai thanked all those who expressed opinions and offered
suggestions regarding her appointment.</P>
      <P>As for the view that Ma's policy to launch direct charter flights starting on
July 4 may eventually fail, Lai said "I am working very hard and everyone else
is also working hard on this issue... we will do our utmost to achieve this
goal."</P>
